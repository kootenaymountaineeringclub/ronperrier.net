The name Alice Springs was given by surveyor William Whitfield Mills after Alice, Lady Todd wife of the telegraph pioneer Sir Charles Todd. Known colloquially as &#8216;The Alice&#8217; or simply &#8216;Alice&#8217;, the town is situated roughly in Australia&#8217;s geographic centre. It is nearly equidistant from Adelaide and Darwin.<br /> <sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"></sup>The area is also known locally as Mparntwe to its original inhabitants, the Arrernte, who have lived in the Central Australian desert in and around what is now Alice Springs for tens of thousands of years.<br /> The town straddles the usually dry Todd River on the northern side of the MacDonnell Ranges. The surrounding region is known as Central Australia, or the Red Centre, an arid environment consisting of several deserts. Temperatures in Alice Springs can vary, with an average maximum in summer of 35.6 °C (96.1 °F) and an average minimum in winter of 5.1 °C (41.2 °F).<br /> <sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"></sup><strong>History.</strong> Arrernte country is rich with mountain ranges, waterholes and gorges, which create a variety of natural habitats. <sup id="cite_ref-a_town_like_mparntwe_9-1" class="reference"><br /> </sup><span id="European_settlement" class="mw-headline"><em>European settlement.</em> </span>In 1861–62, John McDouall Stuart led an expedition through Central Australia to the west of what later became Alice Springs, thereby establishing a route from the south of the continent to the north. <sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"></sup>A settlement named after Stuart was necessitated ten years later with the construction of a repeater station on the Australian Overland Telegraph Line (OTL), which linked Adelaide to Darwin and Great Britain. The OTL was completed in 1872. It traced Stuart&#8217;s route and opened up the interior for permanent settlement. The Alice Springs Telegraph Station was sited near what was thought to be a permanent waterhole in the normally dry Todd River,<br /> <sup id="cite_ref-ausgeorc_16-0" class="reference"></sup>It was not until alluvial gold was discovered at Arltunga, 100 kilometres (62 mi) east of the present Alice Springs, in 1887 that any significant European settlement occurred. The town&#8217;s first substantial building was the Stuart Town Gaol in Parson&#8217;s Street; this was built in 1909, when the town had a European population of fewer than 20 people. Many of the gaol&#8217;s first prisoners were first-contact Aboriginal men incarcerated for killing cattle.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"></sup><br /> The first aircraft, piloted by Francis Stewart Briggs, landed in 1921. Central Australia&#8217;s first hospital, Adelaide House, was built in 1926 when the European population of the town was about 40. It was not until 1929, when the train line to Alice was built, that the town&#8217;s European population began to grow. Aboriginal Centralians outnumbered European Centralians until the mid-1930s.<sup id="cite_ref-flynntrail.org.au_24-0" class="reference"></sup><br /> <sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"></sup>The original mode of British-Australian transportation in the outback was camel trains, operated by immigrants from Pathan tribes in the North-West Frontier of then-British India (present-day Pakistan). Many cameleers moved to Alice Springs in 1929 when the railway finally reached the town and transported goods from the rail head to stations and settlements to the north. A gold rush in Tennant Creek in 1932 kept the wheels of the Alice Springs economy turning until the outbreak of World War II.<br /> <sup id="cite_ref-flynntrail.org.au_24-1" class="reference"></sup>Alice Springs was connected to Darwin by rail on 4 February 2004, when the first passenger train arrived in Darwin from Adelaide.<br /> <em><span id="World_War_II" class="mw-headline">World War II. </span></em>Prior to the war, Alice Springs was an isolated settlement of fewer than 500 people. During the war, however, the town was an extremely active staging base, known as No. 9 Australian Staging Camp, and a depot base for the long four-day trip to Darwin. When Darwin was threatened by Japanese forces, the sea routes—the Northern Territory capital&#8217;s primary means of transportation and resupply—were cut off. With the evacuation of Darwin, Alice Springs became the wartime civilian capital of the Northern Territory.<br /> The number of personnel passing through totalled close to 200,000. <sup id="cite_ref-thewaryears_28-0" class="reference"></sup>Once the war ended, the military camps and the evacuees departed, and Alice Springs&#8217; population declined rapidly.<br /> The war years also left behind many structures &#8211; the Totem Theatre, Seven Mile Aerodrome, Alice Springs&#8217; water supply, and improving the rail head. The war-related operations left behind thousands of pieces of excess military equipment.<br /> <span id="After_World_War_II" class="mw-headline"><em>After World War II.</em> </span>During the 1960s, Alice Springs became an important defence location with the development of the US/Australian Pine Gap joint defence satellite monitoring base, home to about 700 workers from both countries.<br /> By far the major industry in recent times is tourism.<br /> Almost in the exact centre of the continent, Alice Springs is some 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) from the nearest ocean and 1,500 kilometres (930 mi) from the nearest major cities, Darwin and Adelaide. Alice Springs is at the midpoint of the Adelaide–Darwin Railway.<br /> <sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"></sup><em><span id="Modern_town" class="mw-headline">Modern town. </span></em>The modern town of Alice Springs has both European and Aboriginal influences. The town&#8217;s focal point, the Todd Mall, hosts a number of Aboriginal art galleries and community events. Alice Springs&#8217; desert lifestyle has inspired several unique events, such as the Camel Cup, the Henley-on-Todd Regatta, Beanie Festival and the Tatts Finke Desert Race.<br /> Alice Springs has many historic buildings, including the Overland Telegraph Station, the Old Courthouse and Residency and the Hartley Street School. Adelaide House, a beautiful stone building in the middle of the Mall, Central Australia&#8217;s first hospital was built in 1926. Today it is a museum.<br /> <sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"></sup>Today, the town is an important tourist hub and service centre for the surrounding area. It is a well-appointed town for its size, with several large hotels, a world-class convention centre, and a good range of visitor attractions, restaurants, and other services.<br /> <strong>Geography.</strong> The region around Alice Springs is part of the Central Ranges xeric scrub area of dry scrubby grassland and includes the MacDonnell Ranges, which run east and west of the town and contain a number of hiking trails and swimming holes, such as Ormiston Gorge, Ormiston Gorge Creek, Red Bank Gorge and Glen Helen Gorge. The 223-kilometre-long (139 mi) Larapinta Trail follows the West MacDonnell Ranges and is considered among the world&#8217;s great walking experiences.<br /> The Simpson Desert, southeast of Alice Springs, is one of Australia&#8217;s great wilderness areas, containing giant, red sand dunes and rock formations, such as Chambers Pillar and Rainbow Valley.<br /> <span id="Climate" class="mw-headline"><strong>Climate</strong> &#8211; </span>subtropical hot desert climate with very hot, fairly moist summers and short, very dry, mild winters.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Climates_and_Weather_Explained_35-0" class="reference"></sup> Central Australia, also called the Red Centre, is an arid environment consisting of several different deserts. The annual average rainfall is 285.9 millimetres (11.3 in), which would make it a semi-arid climate, except that its high evapotranspiration, or its aridity, makes it a desert climate.<br /> <sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"></sup><strong>Demography</strong><em>.</em> Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 21.2% of the population. As Alice Springs is the regional hub of Central Australia, it attracts Aboriginal people from all over that region and well beyond. Many Aboriginal people visit regularly to use the town&#8217;s services. Aboriginal residents usually live in the suburbs, on special purpose leases (or town camps), or further out at Amoonguna to the south and on the small family outstation communities on Aboriginal lands in surrounding areas.<br /> Americans. Since the early 1970s, the majority of the American population in Alice Springs has been associated with proximity to Pine Gap, a joint Australian-US satellite tracking station, located 19 kilometres (12 mi) southwest of Alice Springs, that employs about 700 Americans and Australians. Currently, 2,000 residents of the Alice Springs district hold American citizenship. Many of these, joined by some Australians, celebrate major American public holidays, including the 4th of July and Thanksgiving. Americans in Alice Springs are also known to participate in a variety of associations and sporting teams, including baseball, basketball and soccer competitions.<br /> <sup id="cite_ref-The_American_Connection_47-0" class="reference"></sup>Foreign tourists usually pass through on their way to Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, whilst Australian tourists usually come through as a part of an event such as the Masters Games and the Finke Desert Race.<br /> <strong>Crime.</strong> Property crime and violent crime, including domestic violence, often linked to alcohol and drug abuse, has been a significant social issue in Alice Springs in the 21st century, with most of the victims being residents of the town. Many approaches and programs have been tried over the years, with varying levels of success. Crime in Alice Springs has risen dramatically since 2022<sup id="cite_ref-85" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-86" class="reference"></sup> and has been noted to do so around the time that the Northern Territory government lifted alcohol bans for many communities.<sup id="cite_ref-87" class="reference"></sup> The bans were reintroduced in 2023.</p><p><sup id="cite_ref-88" class="reference"></sup><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Alice Springs Reptile Centre.</strong> Besides the usual snakes (many venomous which Australia is famous for), there is a saltwater crocodile and some amazing lizards &#8211; Perentle goannas, frilled-necked lizards and thorny Devils. $22, 18 reduced. </span><br style="font-size: 16px;" /><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Bojangles Saloon and Restaurant.</strong> In the NM Bizzarium series, this Western-style bar has cowboy hats, chaps, bull horns, a skeleton riding a ruined motorcycle, seats made of saddles and beer kets, horseshoes, a model train on a track, old radios, a sewing machine, washstand, barrels old bottles and photos &#8211; a quirky assortment of stuff.<br /> </span><strong>Olive Pink Botanic Garden.</strong> Not a normal botanical garden, it has many indigenous plants and trees in a natural environment &#8211; wattles, mallae, ancient landscapes {a series of posters showing rocky desert, gorges, riverine, woodlands, mulga (acacia, 1/2 of all plants), salt lakes and spinifex grasslands (1/3 of all plants)}. medicine bush waterholes.

The very uncertain service via this route was tolerated because steam locomotives needed large quantities of water, and Stuart&#8217;s route to Alice Springs was the only one that had sufficient available water.<br /> Initially operated fortnightly, in the 1930s, it was increased to weekly. From 1956 until 1975, it operated twice weekly, before reverting to a weekly service. During World War II, the service had to be greatly expanded, putting great pressure on the limited water supplies. As a result, de-mineralization towers, some of which survive to this day, were built along the track so that bore water could be used. When a new line to Alice Springs was built in the 1970s, the use of diesel locomotives meant that there was far less need for water, thus allowing the line to take the much drier route from Tarcoola to Alice Springs.

Before Adelaide House was built there was no doctor in the region and people had to rely on their own experience and basic supplies in case of general illness. In cases of emergency, a doctor would be called into the Central Telegraph Office in Adelaide and their advice would be transmitted via telegram. This, of course, leads to many preventable deaths. Flynn prioritized the building of a hospital over that of a church.<br /> Construction started in 1920 when local stonemason Jack Williams (who had built the Stuart Town Gaol), who was 70 years old was given the contract.

When coupled with the profound spiritual importance of many parts of Ulu<u>r</u>u-Kata Tju<u>t</u>a National Park, the natural qualities convey a powerful sense of the very long evolution of the Australian continent.<br /> Ulu<u>r</u>u-Kata Tju<u>t</u>a National Park has been home to the A<u>n</u>angu people for tens of thousands of years and contains significant physical evidence of one of the oldest continuous cultures in the world. A<u>n</u>angu is the term that Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara Aboriginal people, from the Western Desert region of Australia, use to refer to themselves. Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara are the two principal dialects.<br /> Traditional Anangu law, the Tjukurpa, is the foundation of the A<u>n</u>angu living cultural landscape. The Tjukurpa is an outstanding example of traditional law and spirituality and reflects the relationships between people, plants, animals and the physical features of the land. It is expressed in verbal narratives, lengthy Inma (ceremony and associated rituals and song lines), art, the landscape itself, traditional hunting, gathering and other practices of great antiquity that have created an intimate relationship between people and their environment.<br /> The huge monolith of Ulu<u>r</u>u and multiple rock domes of Kata Tju<u>t</u>a (32 kilometres to the west of Ulu<u>r</u>u) have outstanding scenic grandeur, contrasting with each other and the surrounding flat sand plains. The monolithic nature of Ulu<u>r</u>u is emphasised by sheer, steep sides rising abruptly from the surrounding plain, with little or no vegetation to obscure the silhouette.<br /> The inselbergs (steep-sided isolated hills rising abruptly from the earth) of Ulu<u>r</u>u and Kata Tju<u>t</u>a are outstanding examples of tectonic, geochemical and geomorphic processes. Ulu<u>r</u>u and Kata Tju<u>t</u>a reflect the age, and relatively stable nature, of the Australian continent. The sides of Ulu<u>r</u>u are marked by a number of unusual features which can be ascribed to differing processes of erosion resulting in the sheeting of rock parallel to the existing surface. During rain periods, the runoff from Ulu<u>r</u>u cascades down the fissures forming waterfalls, some up to 100 metres high. Caves at the base of Ulu<u>r</u>u are formed by a widespread arid zone process of granular disintegration known as cavernous weathering.<br /> Climbing Uluru has not been allowed since October 2019.</p><header class="mw-body-header vector-page-titlebar"></header><div id="bodyContent" class="vector-body ve-init-mw-desktopArticleTarget-targetContainer" aria-labelledby="firstHeading" data-mw-ve-target-container=""><div id="mw-content-text" class="mw-body-content mw-content-ltr" dir="ltr" lang="en"><div class="mw-parser-output"><p><b>Uluru</b> (from Wikipedia) is a large sandstone formation in the centre of Australia. Uluru is sacred to the Pitjantjatjara, the Aboriginal people of the area, known as the Aṉangu.

Its spectacular scenery includes landscapes of arresting beauty, with escarpments up to 330 metres high extending in a jagged and unbroken line for hundreds of kilometres.<br /> The hunting-and-gathering tradition demonstrated in the art and archaeological record is a living anthropological tradition that continues today, which is rare for hunting-and-gathering societies worldwide. There are a wide range of human figures and identifiable animal species, including animals long-extinct.<br /> Kakadu National Park contains a remarkable contrast between the internationally recognized Ramsar–listed wetlands and the spectacular rocky escarpment and its outliers. The vast expanse of wetlands to the north of the park extends over tens of kilometres and provides habitat for millions of waterbirds. The escarpment consists of vertical and stepped cliff faces up to 330 metres high and extends in a jagged and unbroken line for hundreds of kilometres. The plateau areas behind the escarpment are inaccessible by vehicle and contain large areas with no human infrastructure and limited public access. The views from the plateau are breathtaking.<br /> Kakadu’s ancient escarpment and stone country span more than two billion years of geological history, whereas the floodplains are recent, dynamic environments, shaped by changing sea levels and big floods every wet season.<br /> The property protects an extraordinary number of plant and animal species including over one-third of Australia’s bird species, one-quarter of Australia’s land mammals and an exceptionally high number of reptile, frog and fish species.

I have been retired since 2006 and in that time have traveled every winter for four to seven months. The months that I am "home", are often also spent on the road, hiking or kayaking.
