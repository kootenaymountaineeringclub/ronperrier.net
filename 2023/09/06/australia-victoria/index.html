They manipulated the water flow through volcanic rock and trapped fish there (especially kooyang). The associated practices are still part of the Gunditjmara living cultural tradition. It has three components.<br /> <strong>Get there.</strong> No public transportation. To see the Tyrendarra area from Mt Eccles it is necessary to go around (via Bessiebelle to the East or using Ettrick-Condah Road to the West).<br /> <strong>Budj Bim (northern) component. </strong>Mt Eccles National Park. Lake Surprise is a crater lake with visibe past volcanic activity. There are 2 hiking paths around the lake &#8211; one a one hour loop near the lake and the second  that goes on the crater rim (2 hours). The area is quite spectacular although there is not much to see in terms of ancient human activity. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Also visit lava blisters and natural volcanic caves. </span>Park near Lake Surprise with a camping area with a small visitors centre. Natural Bridge 45 min from the visitors center has a direct hiking path.<br /> <strong>Kurtonitj (central) component<br /> </strong><strong>Tyrendarra (southern) component.<br /> </strong>Mount Eccles (Budj Bim or &#8220;High Head&#8221;) started erupting 27-30,000 years ago ending about 7000 years ago. The lava flow extends for 50 km to the southwest with about 15 km presently under water. A tongue of the lava flow blocked the natural drainage locking water across 100 square kilometres into lakes, ponds, and swamps. Archaeology shows that the first inhabitants date from about 6,600 years ago. The Fitzroy River and Darlot Creek were blocked to create ponds in the huge wetland. Darlot creak never goes dry as it is fed from a spring from Lake Carnah.<br /> The people built wiers and dams to control the water as it varied with the season to form aquaculture networks using every pond, lake, and swamp. Barrier weirs and excavated channels directed water to V-shaped fish traps constructed of stones to which were anchored woven baskets catching fish and eels. When the water was deeper or wider, traps of wood poles used more than one basket. This provided a steady supply of high-protein food and a settled lifestyle. They had aquatic plants (water ribbon for salads and tubers for roasting), material for baskets, nets, sting and eel traps. The ponds attracted wildlife &#8211; eels, turtles, and hundreds of birds with their eggs. There were kangaroos and other marsupials. Food was placed in grass-lined baskets covered in underground oven pits and heated with stones. The meat was chargrilled on fires.<br /> There are hundreds of stone circles, the foundations for bee-hive dome-shaped houses. The houses had a stone foundation, a structure of tree limbs covered with mud and then covered with grass. They faced the door to the north and northeast away from the cold winter winds. The largest is 5 m in diameter, large enough for 3 families. Houses were interconnected for extended families. The houses were clustered to form permanent villages on the higher ground beside each aquaculture system at Lake Gorrrie, Allambee, Kurtonetz Lake Conday, and Tyrendarra. They had a stable year-round food supply. This demolishes the myth that all Aboriginal people were nomadic hunter-gatherers. Complex kinship arrangements, a trading economy, and hereditary chiefs resulted.<br /> In the 1830s and 1840s, during the long Eumeralla War, the villages were destroyed and the people exiled onto a single tiny reserve. Few traces remain. The area was drained starting in 1887.<br /> <strong>Get there.</strong> I visited the small visitors center in Heywood and got instructions about the <strong><em>Tyrendarra Indigenous Protected Area</em></strong>, the location of this component of the WHS &#8211; 21 km from Heywood or about 2 km from the tiny hamlet of Tyrendarra (basically a church and a few houses).<br /> <strong>My experience.</strong> Cross the bridge to several storyboards of the site’s history and value for the Gunditjmara people. The area is somewhat hard to understand and needs imagination to learn how they transformed the area into a fish farm in ancient times as it is covered with reeds. Pass a closed building (with a lovely painted floor and some boomerangs, clubs, digging tools, and a ladle on a table). Walk on a metal walkway that circles around a village site. Stone circles are obvious. There is a loop that goes to the left out to a sign about Budj Bim and its eruption. This is where I ended up after my 4 km traipse through the grass. Pass some stone channels.<br /> A man said that he had walked a loop. A 2-metre-wide rough trail (basically mowed grass) took off to the right so I took it. I thought it would never end and I ended up walking about 4 km through areas of tufted grass. I saw many kangaroos in a large group. It eventually turned left and returned to the center. It passed many round piles of rocks that I thought were village sites but were in fact tumuli &#8211; circular mounds of rock up to 10 m high and 20 m around that are &#8220;lava blisters&#8221; formed by surface lava cooling quickly and the pressure of the lava below rises and the mass solidifies.<br /> On leaving, there was a koala in the tree beside the parking lot.<br /> Free</p><p><strong>Port Fairy. </strong>Town<br /> ON Wayside in Warrnambool. Enclosed with nice tables. Lovely, my best stay in the whole trip.<br /> Mileage: 143 km</p><p><strong>Day 43</strong> Wed Nov 1<br /> <strong>WARRNAMBOOL</strong><br /> <strong>Warrnambool Botanic Gardens.</strong> Opened in 1866, this is lovely garden with wide open lawns, great flower and bush beds, and some very big trees &#8211; palms, figs, a Dutch Elm (the &#8220;money tree&#8221; as so much has been spent on keeping it living), a Norfolk Pine, and the Lone Pine (planted in 1934 from an acorn rescued at Gallipoli in 1915. A well from 1882 is 18 m deep and lit). Instruction signs on watering and soil were nice. Free<br /> <strong>Flagstaff Hill Maritime Village</strong>. A recreated maritime village from the 1960s with several moved buildings and constructed buildings &#8211; confectionary, dressmaker, cooperage, inn, houses, cafe, school, pub, boat building (building a surf boat), clock repair, wagons, anchors, and an interesting theatre where the screen is a curtain of water pr0duced from a high-powered fountain. Learn the history of the many local shipwrecks. $19.50, reduced $15.50.</p><p><strong>GREAT OCEAN ROAD.</strong> A 240-kilometre (150 mi) stretch of road along the south-eastern coast of Australia, between the Victorian towns of Torquay and Allansford near Warrnambool. Built by returned soldiers between 1919 and 1932, and dedicated to soldiers killed during World War I, the road is the world&#8217;s largest war memorial. Winding through varying terrain along the coast, and providing access to several prominent landmarks, The road is an important tourist attraction, possibly the state&#8217;s top tourist experience. Except for a forest section between the 12 Apostles and Apollo Bay, much of the road hugs the coastline along what is known, east of the Otway Ranges, as the Surf Coast,<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"></sup> and, west of Cape Otway, as the Shipwreck Coast.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"></sup> It provides extensive views over Bass Strait and the Southern Ocean. The cliffs are composed of limestone and sandstone, which are susceptible to erosion.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference">[8]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-indi_9-0" class="reference">[9]</sup> The road travels via Anglesea, Lorne, Apollo Bay, and Port Campbell, the latter being notable for its natural limestone and sandstone rock formations, including Loch Ard Gorge, The Grotto, London Arch (formerly London Bridge), and The Twelve Apostles. The stretch of the Great Ocean Road nearer to Torquay closely follows the coast, with some sheer cliffs.<br /> In its original state, the road was considered a formidable drive, fitting only a single vehicle comfortably at a time.<br /> <strong>Bay of Islands Coastal Park.</strong> 33 km long. 6000 years ago, the shore was 300 m further out.<br /> <em>Bay of Islands viewpoint.</em> Several great stacks and a few islands. The best scene along the GOR. In storms, the waves are up to 30 m high.<br /> <em>Bay of Martyrs viewpoint.</em><br /> Peterborough town. Very small<br /> <em>Halladale Walk.</em> 4 km return along cliff, coastal lookouts. Starts at the Peterborough Golf Course<br /> <strong>Port Campbell National Park. </strong>Extends along the ocean from Peterborough to Princetown.<br /> <em>The Grotto viewpoint. </em><br /> <em>London Bridge viewpoint.</em> An island with a great arch in the centre.<br /> The Arch viewpoint.<br /> Point Campbell town. Very small<br /> <em>Port Campbell Discovery Walk</em>. 4.4 km return along the cliff. Starts at Port Campbell Beach or the Town Scenic Viewpoint.<br /> <em>Loch Ard Gorge viewpoint</em>. Two large sea stacks. The razorback is a ridge of eroded limestone with an arch formed by sea spray. Has the Living on the Edge Walk, The Wreck of the Loch Ard Walk, and the Geology Walk.<br /> <em>Twelve Apostles viewpoint.</em> Easiest the busiest spot on the entire road, there were thousands here &#8211; surprisingly 90% were Chinese, 5% Indian and 5% Caucasian. The Apostles are sea stacks but only about five are visible. Not as impressive as the reputation portrays.<br /> <span id="Great_Ocean_Walk" class="mw-headline"><strong>Great Ocean Walk.</strong> A 104 km trail between the 12 Apostles and Apollo Bay opened in 2004 that normally takes about 8 days. Has 7 campsites that are booked online. High tides at one river and two beaches and heavy rains at three rivers are the only hazards.<br /> <strong>Great Otway National Park.</strong> Extends from Princetown to Torquay. Pass through an extensive forest and then hundreds of skeletons of white trees that would be a great photographic site in good light.<br /> </span><strong>Cape Otway Light House.</strong> This 1848 LH is the oldest on the Australian mainland. It sits 100 m above where the Bass Strait and Southern Ocean collide. It is part of a precinct with an 1850s lighthouse keeper house, and a WWII bunker and radar station. 12 km off the highway. Open from 9:30 with the last entry at 4:30. $10, $8.50 reduced<br /> ON Cape Otway LH parking lot. Very dark. Poor data connection.<br /> Mileage: 166 km</p><p><strong>Day 44</strong> Thur Nov 2<br /> <strong>Apollo Bay</strong>. (town) The Great Ocean Road rejoins the ocean here and hugs it all the way to Anglesea, before its end in Torquay. There are always great views of the surf pounding on rocks and sand. The seaside housing is very high-end.<br /> <strong>Lorne.</strong> An attractive, tourist town with a big beach backed by a lovely park with a sculpture walk. There are several wayside parking areas with tables on the beach.<br /> <strong>Australia National Surfing Museum.</strong> Torquay. See many boards from vintage to competition surfboards, memorabilia, the Australian Surfing Hall of Fame, surfing films, clothes and icons of surfing. $12, reduced $8.<br /> <strong>Carter/Tucker House,</strong> Breamlea. In the NM Architectural Delights series, this was hard to find as it is not on Google Maps. I asked for directions &#8211; it is known as the &#8220;architect&#8217;s house&#8221;. It is on Breamlea Road, the main street of Breamlee facing north about 3/4s of the way along from the Breamlea Caravan Park (there are only houses on the south side of the street as there is marsh across the road). Once there, it is still hard to see what the house looks like as it is fronted with a lot of trees. I opened the gate and walked up the gravel path. It is a three-story rectangular box with the top an open deck. The north and west sides are covered in narrow horizontal wood slats with large sections over the windows that lift up. The landscaping is also very nice. It looks well cared for and I didn&#8217;t knock on the door to see if I could go inside.<br /> 12m x 6m box was embedded into the side of a sand dune. The house has three rooms. The lower ground floor is for guests and the single space can be divided by a sliding wall into two rooms if so required. Similarly, the single space on the middle level can also be divided to separate the owner’s bedroom from a small sitting area. The top floor is for living and eating and takes advantage of views across a rural landscape. The top floor is also a daylight photographic studio.</p><p><strong>QUEENSCLIFF </strong><br /> <strong>Fort Queenscliff Museum.</strong> An army museum, it can only be seen by tours on Saturdays and Sundays at 1 and 3. $20, reduced $15 I didn&#8217;t go.<br /> <strong>Queenscliff Maritime Museum.</strong> I get tired of maritime museums but was quite excited to see three very famous kayaks here. The first was from the 1969 first circumnavigation of Tasmania. The next two were from the two circumnavigations of Australia &#8211; both started and ended in Queenscliff. In 1981-82, Paul Caffyn took 12 months in a Nordkapp fitted with a jury-rigged rudder. From Jan 18, 2009 to Dec 15, 2009, Freya Hoffmeister paddled an Epic (has a rudder) and with radio communication and GPS. Then I had a subscription to Sea Kayak Magazine and Freya posted monthly updates of her trip so I knew it well. Two of the biggest hurdles were the 3-day paddle across the Gulf of Carpenthia (to avoid saltwater crocodiles, she slept in her boat) and the 200 km stretch of cliffs along the West Coast of Australia where she couldn&#8217;t land. All three kayaks had been donated to the Queenscliff Kayak Club and when it disbanded, the kayaks were given to the maritime museum. Freya&#8217;s boat had everything &#8211; water bladder and bottle, paddles, under-deck bags, and PFD.<br /> I have had many arguments about rudder versus skeg. Rudders have the disadvantage of having the stern out of the water on large swells but deal with weathercocking so much better, they are a clear favourite over skegs.<br /> There were also exhibits and models of several boats (including some of the 120 shipwrecks trying to navigate the harbour rip), how ships in a bottle are made (outside the bottle with hinging masts that are folded and the intact ship is placed inside), a large one showing the hydrology of the narrow rip that sits over a canyon produced when Australia was connected to Tasmania, $13, reduced $10<br /> Narana Aboriginal Cultural Centre, Charlemont:</p><p><strong>GEELONG<br /> </strong><strong>Geelong Gaol Museum. </strong>In the NM The Dark Side series, this was the third prison built in Victoria. It held only non-convicts used to build infrastructure during the 1850s gold rush (there was nothing here and there were thousands of miners). It also served as the state prison hospital and morgue. Some of the more interesting exhibits were on Ned Kelly (and his fascinating armour), prison uniforms dating from the convict era. There were 6 hangings here &#8211; the last in 1865 was the most famous when the subject was decapitated and his wife put the head and body in her shop window decrying how bad the prison was (this was the only burial on the prison grounds). $20, reduced $15<br /> <strong>Botanic Gardens. </strong>Huge areas of grass and big trees mark this garden. It is not so interesting. Free<br /> <strong>National Wool Museum. </strong>History of the Australian wool industry, a carpet-making machine, odd fashion pieces, and an art quilt exhibit. $15, $10 reduced<strong><br /> </strong><strong>Geelong Waterfront. </strong>In the NM Urban Legends series, this is a two-block long section of waterfront with a nice malecon on the water. The Cunningham Pier has a restaurant/nightclub that I didn&#8217;t walk to the end to see. A nice park, floating metal Xmas tree, sculpture, Visitors Information Center, and a marina complete the area. I ate at a fish&amp;chips place at the far north end.<br /> <strong>Geelong Gallery. </strong>In a lovely columned stone building with a massive new crescent structure at the back, there is a large skylight over the main gallery. It has a lot of 19th and 20th-century art, and decorative arts (porcelain, art pottery, and nice modern art). Free <strong><br /> </strong></p><p>ON Wayside halfway to Ballarat. Victoria doesn&#8217;t have the frequent nice waysides with covered picnic tables that the rest of the states have.<br /> Mileage: 227 km</p><p><strong>Day 45</strong> Fri Nov 3<br /> The area north of Melbourne is all Goldfields &#8211; all the communities started with the 1850 gold rush and show a lot of prosperity &#8211; many large stone buildings and great architecture from the 1860s.</p><p><strong>BALLARAT<br /> </strong>83 km north of Geelong<br /> <strong>Sovereign Hill.</strong> A recreated gold rush town from 1850-60 with many interactive displays (blacksmithing, panning for gold, printing, gold pour), a complete town, a gold mine tour, and a museum. Suggest at least 4 hours to see it all. $49, reduced 45. I didn&#8217;t go because of the expense, and time and I wasn&#8217;t interested in spending enough time to get my value from the high entrance fee.<br /> <strong>Art Gallery of Ballarat.</strong> Dating from 1890 in a purpose-built lovely building, much of the art was donated by wealthy gold people.

Greater Melbourne is an urban agglomeration of 31 local municipalities. The City of Melbourne is based around its central business area. It occupies much of the northern and eastern coastlines of Port Phillip Bay and spreads into the Mornington Peninsula, as well as the hinterlands towards the Yarra Valley, the Dandenong Ranges, and the Macedon Ranges. Most people reside on the east side of the city centre.<br /> The area of Melbourne has been home to Aboriginal Victorians for over 40,000 years and serves as an important meeting place for local Kulin nation clans. A short-lived penal settlement was built at Port Phillip in 1803, but it was not until 1835, with the arrival of free settlers from Van Diemen&#8217;s Land (modern-day Tasmania), that Melbourne was founded.<sup id="cite_ref-settlement8-9_18-1" class="reference"></sup> During the 1850s Victorian gold rush, the city entered a lengthy boom period that, by the late 1880s, had transformed it into one of the world&#8217;s largest and wealthiest metropolises. Today, it is a leading financial centre in the Asia-Pacific region and ranks 32nd globally in the March 2022 Global Financial Centres Index.<br /> <sup id="cite_ref-GFCI2_24-0" class="reference"></sup>The city gave rise to Australian rules football, Australian impressionism and Australian cinema, and a global centre for street art, live music and theatre.

On a fine day sunlight, streaming through the roof, imparts a reddish glow on the sculpture below.  The base of the memorial, surrounded by an iron picket balustrade, is paved with red tiles that have various verses inscribed on them in gold lettering. There are also inscriptions on each pediment and entablature of the temple structure, in both English and Greek. Nowhere on the memorial is there any mention of the deceased&#8217;s name, the most specific reference being the following inscription: <i>My own true love, </i><i>Pattern daughter perfect mother and ideal wife, </i><i>Born on the 26th day of January 1867, </i><i>Married on the 26th day of January 1887, </i><i>Buried on the 26th day of January 1897. </i>&#8220;Pattern Daughter, Perfect Mother, and Ideal Wife&#8221;.<br /> Circling the memorial from the eastern side, looking up at the four gables one reads the words, &#8220;Peace Evermore&#8221;, &#8220;Life Evermore&#8221;, &#8220;Light Evermore&#8221; and &#8220;Love Evermore&#8221;<br /> <strong>Fitzroy</strong> (pop 10,431) is an inner-city suburb in Melbourne 3 km north-east of downtown.  Planned as Melbourne&#8217;s first suburb in 1839, <sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"></sup>it is Melbourne&#8217;s smallest and most densely populated area.

The third section is about Melbourne, Phar Lap (the great Australian racehorse), Aborigines, and a great section of miniatures.<br /> <strong>ROYAL EXHIBITION and CARLTON GARDENS WHS<br /> </strong>Designed for the great international exhibitions of 1880 and 1888 in Melbourne, the building is constructed of brick, timber, steel, and slate. It combines elements from the Byzantine, Romanesque, Lombardic, and Italian Renaissance styles. The property is typical of the international exhibition movement which saw over 50 exhibitions staged between 1851 and 1915 in venues including Paris, New York, Vienna, Calcutta, Kingston (Jamaica) and Santiago (Chile). All shared a common theme and aim: to chart material and moral progress through displays of industry from all nations.<br /> The Royal Exhibition Building and Carlton Gardens are a surviving manifestation of the international exhibition movement that blossomed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These were the largest events staged in colonial Australia and helped to introduce the world to Australian industry and technology.<br /> There are three parts: The Great Hall was the exhibition building, a permanent building initially intended to house the Melbourne International Exhibition of 1880 and the subsequent 1888 Melbourne Centennial International Exhibition. It is cruciform and incorporates a dome, great portal entries, viewing platforms, towers, and fanlight windows. The formal Carlton Gardens has tree-lined pathways, fountains, and lakes.<br /> The Royal Exhibition Building is seen only by tour organized through the Melbourne Museum $29 (museum included in this fee). Often closed as it holds exams for two of the largest universities in Melbourne. The Carleton Gardens have two nice fountains at the entrance but otherwise are just grass and big trees.<br /> <strong>Fire Services Museum of Victoria.</strong> The history of fire fighting in Melbourne (the first was in 1839 (horses). Has a lot of helmets, uniforms, medals, photos, and some old wagons. Black Friday in 1939, Black Saturday in 2009 with huge forest fires, and the 1897 Great Melbourne fire. $10, reduced $8<br /> <strong>St. Patrick&#8217;s Cathedral.</strong> Dark stone with two bell towers and a large central tower over the cross, both with high spires. Inside has a lovely wood ceiling, big stained glass windows with a yellow geometric pattern, 8 chapels behind the altar, and large Ways of the Cross with coloured basreliefs.<br /> <strong>The Old Treasury Building.</strong> The temporary exhibit was &#8220;Lost Jobs&#8221; or jobs that don&#8217;t exist anymore &#8211; hangman, factory jobs, domestic labour, maritime, hawkers, street urchins, trains, farming, miners, gambling, prostitution, transport, printing, leeches). Permanent exhibits were on the building (1862), the gold rush, Yamma River, aboriginal appropriation of land, women&#8217;s rights, and a replica of the 71 kg Welcome Stranger gold nugget. Free<br /> <strong>Hotel Windsor.</strong> Hospitality Legends. Built in 1883, this hotel has retained its original look. Cricketer Bar and a big ballroom with several glass skylights.<br /> <strong>Chinese Museum.</strong> In Chinatown,  gives the history of Chinese Australians &#8211; costumes, tools, utensils, arts and crafts, furniture, and household; documents (newspaper clippings, diaries, letters, books, journals); photographs, art, and oral history recordings. $12, reduced $10.50<strong><br /> The Johnston Collection,</strong> Fairhall. (William Robert Johnston 1911-1986). An exhibition space seen only by tour (3 times a day) organized on their website &#8211; johnstonecollection.org (arrive at the <em>Pullman Melbourne on the Park, </em>192 Wellington Parade, East Melbourne by public transport. All visitors must arrive via The Johnston Collection courtesy bus.<br /> In an unmarked, unsigned house. Google Maps had the incorrect location and it took me a while to find it. $25 (I didn&#8217;t see this).<br /> From their website: 1500 objects &#8211; ceramics, furniture, glass, horology (clocks and watches), metalwork (including silver), paintings (including miniatures and engravings), textiles, and objets d’art predominantly of English 18th-century origin, as well as items from Europe, India, China, and Japan.<br /> <strong>Australian Sport Museum.</strong> At the Melbourne Cricket Club (no thongs, collared shirt), it was closed for renovation until Nov 16. Many great statues of athletes (woman sprinter, cricket bowler).<br /> <strong>Justin Art House Museum</strong><b><span style="color: black;">, </span></b>Prahran. Seen by tour organized from their website jahm.com.au. Charles and Leah Justin, are passionate collectors of contemporary art &#8211; art, architecture, design, and food. They have been collecting contemporary art for over 40 years, and have over 300 works of painting, sculpture, works on and from paper, and photography. There is a strong emphasis on digital and video work. Each visit includes a tour of the exhibition conducted by Charles and Leah, after which visitors are invited to their apartment for refreshments, and to enjoy a conversation about the exhibition, art collecting, or whatever is of interest!!! 25 people per visit. $28 (I didn&#8217;t go here)<br /> <strong>Chadstone Shopping Centre.</strong> A two-story mall that is very high-end &#8211; all the top brand names are on the first floor with a curved glass ceiling. A &#8220;guard&#8221; is at each door to control the number of people in the store. The lower-quality stores are on the basement level. A huge 6-story parking garage.<br /> <strong>George Pentland Botanic Gardens</strong>, Frankston. A long narrow park with mostly grass and big trees but also beds of bushes and non-blooming flowers. Has several gates and many picnic tables.<br /> <strong>Mornington Regional Gallery,</strong> Mornington Peninsula. Has the Archibald Prize awarded for portraiture by the Museum of New South Wales. Many local artists. Free</p><p><em>I then went for a beer at the Tar Brewery with Kieran Burrows (and his father Brian) whom I had met in Kigali Rwanda about 10 months ago. Kieran and I travel completely differently &#8211; he cycles and went through most of East Africa, Botswana, Namibia and South Africa. </em><br /> ON Burrows family home &#8211; a great bed and company.</p><p><strong>Day 55</strong> Mon Nov 13<br /> <strong>Arthurs Seat Cable Car</strong> (The Eagle). Goes to the top of Arthurs Seat, the highest hill around at 314 m. On top is a state park with walks. $31 round trip, reduced $28. I didn&#8217;t go.<br /> <strong>Cape Schanck Lighthouse.</strong> A LH that can&#8217;t be accessed but see from 100 m away, so the museum also can&#8217;t be seen. It is a tapering white stone with a red cap built-in 1839. Views down to the ocean show a boiling mess around the point as two currents collide. There are several nice walks. It is in the Mornington Peninsula NP.<br /> <strong>HMAS Otama</strong>, Hastings. Maritime/Ship Museums. A submarine, closed on Monday.<br /> <strong>Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria &#8211; Cranbourne Gardens</strong>. The only garden here is the Australian Garden, quite unusual and well done. Immediately upon entering, one is confronted with the fantastic red sand garden, a large, round, deep red area with banks and islands of desert plants. Dry river garden, Arrid garden, Lake and river tract, Wierd and Wonderful garden, 13 display gardens, water saving garden and a wonderful diversity garden with narrow, one-metre wide strips of garden from all over Australia. 85% of Australian flora exists nowhere else. Eucalypts are 75% of the species with 600 species. There is a good storyboard on eucalyptus oil &#8211; only 20 of the species are good for oil production, only the leaves are used, and most produced commercially are from the one-metre tall Blue Mallei eucalyptus bush. Free</p><p><strong>Philips Island. The Penguin Parade</strong>. This is a huge tourist draw with thousands coming every night to see the Little Penguin come ashore to their burrow every night at dusk. At one kg in weight and 35 cm in height, they are the smallest and only blue (a deep mid-blue) and white penguin of the 18 species of penguin. They fish for krill, jellyfish, anchovies and sardines diving every few minutes. 32,000 use the south shore of Philips Island to breed with 200-1300 coming to shore each night all year long to enter burrows in the ground for the night. In the winter, they spend up to 4 weeks in the ocean but in breeding season in the spring, only about 2 days. They are sexually promiscuous with a divorce rate of 18-50%. They form communal rafts in the water and cross the beach together around 20:30 once it is nearly dark.<br /> <strong>Get there.</strong> After crossing the bridge to Philips Island, it is about 20 km to Noosie and the Penguin Parade, the route is well-signed.<br /> <strong>Cost:</strong> General viewing $30. Penguins Plus $75, Underground $85, Guided Ranger $95, Ultimate $105 (all these last four were sold out but it seemed to me to be a complete waste of money as one can read all about them in the museum (I never saw one person reading the storyboards in the museum except me, there was great info on all 18 species of penguin, most of them not venturing past the Antarctic and nearby islands) and when you walk from the visitors center to the viewing area on the boardwalk, you see many penguins up very close.<br /> <strong>My experience.</strong> I ate in the parking lot which ended up being packed and left for the visitors center at 19:45 with lots of time to get to the beach. I was almost the last to leave the parking area and couldn&#8217;t believe how early people arrived only to wait. The beach is lit up and the boardwalk has lights so you see many marching to their burrows as you leave the beach. There is a good introduction over speakers and I stood next to one of the guides in the stands and got more info yet). Up to 2500 tickets are sold (there were about 1500 on my night). There are several stands with lots of seating area although I stood and moved along the back to see the first group at the far east end. One can see the dark areas in the water as they form rafts to cross the beach in groups. They are very tentative and approach the beach several times before getting the courage to come at the safest time. It was so dark that without the lights and as they are so small, you would almost see nothing. Most of the ones you see along the boardwalk very close are about 8 weeks old and indistinguishable from the adults (except for the higher-pitched &#8220;squeak&#8221;). <em>I then drove for a long time in the dark to Wilson&#8217;s Promontory. </em><br /> ON Lance Moon Park. A beautiful wayside with covered picnic tables and nice bathrooms. I didn&#8217;t see the sign that camping was not allowed.<br /> Mileage: 8018</p><p><strong>Day 56</strong> Tue Nov 14<br /> <em>I spent a long time in the morning working on my South Pacific trip.</em><br /> <strong>Wilson&#8217;s Promontory Area</strong> (DARE)<br /> <strong>Wilson Promontory NP.</strong> Day use is free. Initially one passes through deep bush but then the road climbs over a pass in low mountains. There are several viewpoints down to the ocean. Many were climbing Mt Bishop. Tidal River has a huge campground and Norman Beach with a lot of surfers (who appeared to be beginners as no one was catching any waves).<br /> <strong>Wilsons Promontory Light station.</strong> The road past Tidal Creek to Mt Oberon was closed so I could not go to the light station.</p><p><strong>Ninety Mile Beach </strong>faces the Bass Strait and backs the Gippsland Lakes. The beach is just over 151 kilometres (94 mi) in length, running northeastward from a spit near Port Albert to the man-made channel at Lakes Entrance. Behind the beach are long sandy dunes that separate the Gippsland Lakes from Bass Strait. The beach is an uninterrupted stretch of untamed coastline; it does not have any rocky headlands or platforms, and offshore there are only a few ribbons of reef which are periodically covered by sand.<br /> In the northern section, the beach runs along a sandbar on what amounts to a series of tidal islands. Behind this are several large lakes and numerous shallow littoral lagoons. The three main lakes are Lake King, Lake Victoria, and Lake Wellington, partially contained within The Lakes National Park.<br /> It offers a wide variety of activities such as camping, picnicking, whale watching, and beach and water-based activities. The beach has golden sand, with crashing waves and a natural bush environment. It is part of the Ninety Mile Beach Marine National Park, which covers 2,750 hectares and 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) of coastline, 30 kilometres (19 mi) south of Sale. There are basic camping facilities within the park at Emu Bight, as well as accommodation at Seaspray and Lakes Entrance.<br /> Rotamah Island, which is part of the Lakes National Park, has a large bird observatory and can be visited by boat from Paynesville, about 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) away.<br /> Coastal towns of Woodside, Loch Sport, Seaspray, Golden Beach, and Lakes Entrance are popular tourist towns. Woodside, Seaspray and Lakes Entrance have life-saving beach patrols during the summer season. Surf fishing is a key drawcard for the area, with main varieties of fish including snapper, flathead, and gummy sharks. Port Albert, McLoughlins Beach, Lochsport, and Lakes Entrance have jetties and temporary berthing facilities.<br /> The beach&#8217;s length ensures that the waves break too close to the beach for good surfing, and there are strong rip currents and cross-currents that make conditions rather hazardous. The local authorities recommend that anyone who wishes to swim should do so at Woodside, Seaspray, and Lakes Entrance, which have life-saving beach patrols during the summer season.<br /> The beach is believed to be the fourth longest uninterrupted beach in the world, behind Praia do Cassino on the Brazilian southern coast, Padre Island on the US Gulf Coast, and Eighty Mile Beach in Western Australia, which is actually 140 miles (230 km) long.<br /> <em>I saw the beach at the Seaspray Beach. Beach could be seen endlessly in both directions. Driving along it, there were many camps and easy beach access. </em><br /> <strong>Gippsland Lakes</strong> are a network of lakes, marshes, and lagoons covering over 600 square kilometres. The Lakes are separated from the ocean by coastal dunes known as Ninety Mile Beach. Birds, dolphins, and pelicans frequent many locations.<br /> Beginning at Sale on the Thomson River, there are three main lakes: Lake King, Lake Victoria, and Lake Wellington and they are all joined and fed by rivers that originate in the high country, including the Mitchell, Nicholson, Tambo, and Avon rivers. The lakes include many small islands, which are reached easily by ferry or water taxi.<br /> The Mitchell River silt jetties is the largest in the world jutting into Lake King with the Mitchell River on one side and the lake on the other. See best from the lookout at Eagle Point Bluff. Two national parks abut the lakes, the Lakes National Park and the Gippsland Lakes Coastal Park, both of which offer great camping and walking tracks.<br /> Wildlife havens include Rotamah Island (only reached by boat, which has birds, kangaroos, and wallabies) and Raymond Island has a koala colony that can be visited from the shore.<br /> ON Stratford (on Avon) at a park in the town. Very nice.<br /> Mileage: 287 km</p><p><strong>Day 57</strong> Wed Nov 15<br /> <em>I started the 350 km drive to Albury NSW late. I got Google Mapped as it took a very direct route, first on a winding road, the Bairnsdale-Dargo Road C601, and after Dargo a narrow paved road that climbed up slowly with a lot of construction. I groaned when I hit gravel through Alpine National Park, basically on the top of the world here &#8211; the Dargo High Plains road. Of variable quality, it lasted 48 km, changed to paved, and finally joined the Great Alpine Highway which now looked like a freeway. It descended on a very winding road for many km until Harrietville and finally leveled out at Bright, a gorgeous town with big trees lining the highway. </em><br /> <strong><br /> GO TO NEW SOUTH WALES &#8211; Central and Western (Wagga Wagga)</strong></p><div class="printfriendly pf-button pf-button-content pf-alignleft"> <a href="index.html#" rel="nofollow" onclick="window.print(); return false;" title="Printer Friendly, PDF & Email"> <noscript><img decoding="async" class="pf-button-img" src="https://cdn.printfriendly.com/buttons/printfriendly-pdf-email-button-md.png" alt="Print Friendly, PDF & Email" style="width: 194px;height: 30px;"  /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload pf-button-img" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://cdn.printfriendly.com/buttons/printfriendly-pdf-email-button-md.png" alt="Print Friendly, PDF & Email" style="width: 194px;height: 30px;"  /> </a></div></div></div><div id="entry-author-info"><div id="author-avatar"></div><div id="author-description"><h2> About admin</h2> I would like to think of myself as a full time traveler.
