About 900 Southern Right whales visit the area ever winter.<br /> <strong>Bunda Cliffs.</strong> A line of dramatic cliffs that drop off into the southern ocean. A high white band of rock is at the bottom. They stretch for 100&#8217;s of kilometres along Nullarbor NP.</p><p>The highway passed through Nullarbor (gas $2.77), the beginning of the Nullarbor Plain, a treeless area of low desert plants. Then there was a huge variety: lovely forest (what this country must have looked like before it was all cleared for agriculture), no trees, and then after Nundroo (gas $2.02!!!), the start of another big wheat belt that continued for several hundred km. Pass through Penong (gas $2.08), Ceduna (gas $2.00, on the ocean, has an active oyster fishery, stopped at a large grocery store to replenish), and on to Wirrulla.<br /> <em>Here I had a big decision to make about even continuing to Coober Pedy. The Gawler Mt Road leaves to the north from here &#8211; 484 km, 7&#8217;12&#8221; &#8211; but I asked at the bar and was told to avoid it at all costs. It is sealed for a km, then awful gravel for 186 km. &#8220;It&#8217;s much better to go via Port Augusta.&#8221; &#8211; 911 km and 9&#8217;26&#8221;. Seeing as my rental car is banned from driving on unsealed roads, this was a no-brainer. I&#8217;ll decide at Port Augusta if I will even go to Coober Pedy (besides the big detour, one negative is the gas is $3.95!!!!).<br /> </em> ON Wirrulla town.<br /> Mileage: 660 km</p><p><strong>Day 32</strong> Sat Oct 21<br /> I continued on to Port Augusta, and bought groceries. Gas $2.03<strong><br /> </strong>From Port Augusta, I drove at dusk and there were many animals on the road – at least four kangaroos crossed in front of me.<br /> ON Wayside unmarked about 100 km south of Wilpena Pond.<br /> Mileage: 459 km 2579 km</p><p><strong>Day 33</strong> Sun Oct 22<br /> I had about 55 km to drive to Wilpena Park Headquarters. Three emu and several kangaroos were again on the road.<br /> The dramatic mountains of the Flinders Range are south of Wilpena Pond – pretty red cliffed mountains.<br /> Wilpena Pond Park Headquarters Fee $15<br /> There is a resort and campground here. The trails start just past the park office but are presented in a confusing way, all as individual hikes, walk to the Hill Homestead and they all depart from there.<br /> <em>Hill Homestead</em> 3.1 km flat. Follows Wilpena Creek through some large eucalyptus and gum trees, many burnt out. Pass through Pound Gap, the only way into the pond. The pond originally held a large sheep operation started in 1851. The 120,000 sheep caused environmental havoc and severely disrupted the aboriginals. A severe drought in the 1860s caused many sheep to die.<br /> The Hill family arrived in 1889 and built the present stone house in 1901. They had 9 children and the oldest daughter is profiled in several of the storyboards.<br /> <em>Trails from the Hill Homestead. </em>None looked interesting and simply through the forest on the bottom of the pond. <em><br /> </em>St Mary&#8217;s Peak 8.9 km. It is sacred and the summit should be avoided. The Tanderra Saddle below the summit provides good views.<br /> Bridle Gap 5.7 km<br /> Malloga Falls 7.8 km. Usually dry. Edrowie Gorge<br /> <em>Wangara Outlook.</em> Follows the ridge immediately behind the house to two lookouts, the farthest 500 m. Both look east and south across the pond, a rather underwhelming view. Thinking that this was surrounded by rock walls, all the hills gradually slope up and encircle the pond. None are rocky but were enough to keep sheep and cattle in the pond. From the upper lookout, there were good views down to the gap.<br /> I returned to the park headquarters and started my drive, 163 km, back to Port Augusta.</p><p><strong>FLINDERS RANGES</strong> Tentative WHS are the largest mountain ranges in South Australia, which starts about 200 km (125 mi) north of Adelaide. The ranges stretch for over 430 km (265 mi) from Port Pirie to Lake Callabonna.<br /> The Adnyamathanha people are the Aboriginal group who have inhabited the range for tens of thousands of years.<br /> Its most well-known landmark is Wilpena Pound / Ikara, a natural amphitheater covering 80 km<sup>2</sup> (31 sq mi) and containing the range&#8217;s highest peak, St Mary Peak (1,171 m (3,842 ft)). The ranges include several national parks, the largest being the Ikara-Flinders Ranges National Parks.<br /> It is an area of great geological and palaeontological significance and includes the oldest fossil evidence of animal life in the Ediacara Hills, southwest of Leigh Creek. Similar fossils have subsequently been found in the ranges, including at Nilpena.<br /> The southern ranges are notable for the Pichi Richi heritage steam and diesel railway and Mount Remarkable National Park.<br /> <sup id="cite_ref-:0_3-3" class="reference"></sup>The Heysen Trail and Mawson Trail run for several hundred kilometers along the ranges, providing scenic long-distance routes for walkers, cyclists, and horse riders.<br /> The flora of the Ranges are largely species adapted to a semi-arid environment, including sugar gum, cypress-pine, mallee, and black oak. Moister areas near Wilpena Pound support grevilleas, Guinea flowers, Liliaceae, and ferns. Reeds and sedges grow near permanent water sources such as springs and waterholes.<br /> Since the eradication of dingos and the establishment of permanent waterholes for stock, the number of red kangaroos, western grey kangaroos, and wallaroos in the Flinders Ranges has increased.<br /> The WHS application was made on the basis of its unique geological and palaeontological values. <sup id="cite_ref-whgeo_23-0" class="reference"></sup>One example is the rock engravings that are understood to be the oldest artwork in the world, some dating back 40,000 years.</p><p><em>In Port Augusta, I got gas and groceries again and started to Broken Hill. None of the wind turbines on a high plateau were turning. After some wheat, the terrain turned to flat pastoral land with lots of sheep. There is a lot of road kill. 320 km Port Augusta to Broken Hill. Pass through some high hills crossing the Horrick Pass.</em><br /> ON Wayside towards Broken Hill.

An inland mining city, is near the border with South Australia (48 km) on the crossing of the Barrier Highway (A32) and the Silver City Highway (B79), in the Barrier Range. It is 315m above sea level, with a hot desert climate, and an average rainfall of 235mm. The closest major city is Mildura, 300km to the south and the nearest State Capital City is Adelaide, the capital of South Australia, more than 500km to the southwest and linked via route A32.<br /> The town is prominent in Australia&#8217;s mining, industrial relations and economic history after the discovery of silver ore led to the opening of various mines, thus establishing Broken Hill&#8217;s recognition as a prosperous mining town well into the 1990s. Despite experiencing a slowing economic situation into the late 1990s and 2000s, Broken Hill remains Australia&#8217;s longest-running mining town.<br /> Broken Hill, historically considered one of Australia&#8217;s boomtowns, has been referred to as &#8220;The Silver City&#8221;. Although over 1100km west of Sydney and surrounded by desert, the town has prominent park and garden displays and offers a number of attractions, such as the Living Desert Sculptures.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"></sup><br /> <em>History</em>. In 1844, the explorer Charles Sturt saw and named the Barrier Range, and at the time referred to a &#8220;Broken Hill&#8221; in his diary. <sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-vgh_6-0" class="reference"></sup>Silver ore was later discovered on this <i>broken hill</i> in 1883. This <i>broken hill</i> no longer exists, having been mined away.<br /> Broken Hill&#8217;s massive orebody, which formed about 1,800 million years ago, has proved to be among the world&#8217;s largest silver–lead–zinc mineral deposits.<br /> Although now depleted somewhat, mining still yields around two million tonnes annually. Sheep farming is now one of the principal industries in the area and there are considerably more sheep than people – almost 2 million Merino sheep.<br /> The Sulzer diesel-powered plant completed in 1931 was one of the earliest examples of the use of diesel power generation in Australia. The Broken Hill Solar Plant was completed in 2016.  A 61 cm pipeline from Menindee on the Darling River supplies water making it a relative oasis amid the harsh climate of the Australian outback. In 2004, due to severe drought across much of the Murray Darling Basin Catchment area, the Darling River ceased to flow and the Menindee Lakes dried out. Broken Hill essentially ran out of water, with muddy sludge coming out of some taps. In April 2019, a new 270 km pipeline was constructed from Wentworth on the Murray River.<br /> <sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"></sup><em>Climate</em>. Broken Hill has a cold desert climate<br /> <em>Demographics.</em> The indigenous community increased from 0.6% in 1971 to 10.0% in 2021, partly owing to the migration of non-indigenous Australians away from Broken Hill. In the 19th and early 20th century, Afghans worked as camel drivers in parts of outback Australia and built the first mosque in New South Wales (1880).<br /> <sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference"></sup><i>Mad Max 2</i> was shot here at the Pinnacles and Mundi Mundi Plains.<br /> <sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference"></sup><strong>Whites Mineral Art Gallery &amp; Mining Museum.</strong> 2000 hand-made dolls and bears, mineral art, history of mining, many mining artifacts, and building dioramas.

Formerly known as General Motors-Holden, it was an Australian subsidiary company of General Motors. It was an Australian automobile manufacturer, importer, and exporter that sold cars under its own marque in Australia. In its last three years, it switched entirely to importing cars. The 164-year-old company ceased trading at the end of 2020.<br /> Holden&#8217;s primary products were its own models developed in-house, such as the Holden Commodore, Holden Caprice, and the Holden Ute. However, Holden had also models under sharing arrangements with Nissan, Suzuki, Toyota, Isuzu, and then GM subsidiaries Opel, Vauxhall Motors, and Chevrolet.<br /> It became a subsidiary of the United States–based General Motors (GM) in 1931 when the company was renamed General Motors-Holden&#8217;s Ltd. It was renamed Holden Ltd in 1998 and adopted the name GM Holden Ltd in 2005. It stopped vehicle and engine production in 2017.<br /> <sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"></sup>Holden produced nearly 7.7 million vehicles. During the 1950s, Holden dominated the Australian car market. The 1951 &#8220;ute&#8221; became ubiquitous in Australian rural areas as the workhorse of choice. It remains one of Australia&#8217;s most recognizable automotive symbols and was synonymous with the &#8216;Australian way of life&#8217;, coming to symbolize the stability of post-war Australian capitalism.

Ceasing to function as a lake ecosystem some 18,500 years ago, Willandra Lakes provides excellent conditions to document life in the Pleistocene epoch, the period when humans evolved into their present form.<br /> Willandra contains some of the earliest evidence of <em>Homo sapiens sapiens</em> outside Africa and the period when humans became dominant in Australia, and the large species of wildlife became extinct.<br /> Sites also illustrate human burials that are of great antiquity, such as a cremation dating to around 40,000 years BP, the oldest ritual cremation site in the world, and traces of complex plant-food gathering systems that date back before 18,000 years BP associated with grindstones to produce flour from wild grass seeds, at much the same time as their use in the Middle East. Archaeological remains such as hearths, stone tools, and shell middens show a remarkable adaptation to local resources. Pigments were transported to these lakeshores before 42,000 years BP. Human fossil trackways are aged between 19,000 and 23,000 years BP.<br /> Officially called Willandra Lakes, it&#8217;s Mungo National Park which is the main attraction. A normal 2WD is ok.<br /> Large lakes dried out about 18,000 years ago and the sand left around the edges has gradually been sculpted by wind and rain called lunettes.<br /> <strong>Get in.</strong> 109 km from Mildura, the last 70 km on an unsealed road of variable quality &#8211; mostly rough hard packed clay, some sand and a lot of washboard which is doable without a 4WD to the visitor centre. Closed in rain &#8211; penalties apply (this road when wet would be a horror show). The Mungo Lodge just before the park entrance is a resting/lunch stop for most tours.<br /> <strong>Stay.</strong> The main campground is just inside the park boundary. Belah campground is about 25 km along the Mungo Tract.<br /> <strong>See.<br /> </strong><em>Visitors Center.</em> Has a great timeline for the area and reasonable displays with archaeology, the aboriginal story and wildlife.<br /> 40-60,000 years ago the lakes were full when this area was much wetter and the Lachlan River flowed into them with spring surges. At their peak, the water was 15 m deep.<br /> 50,000 years ago. First Aboriginal stone artifacts. This period lasted 20,000 years. Mungo man was buried near the shore and Mungo lady was cremated &#8211; the oldest remains of humans outside Africa.<br /> 40,000 years ago. The area became drier. Evidence of middens, fireplaces and artifacts.<br /> The period of glacial maximum and sea level was 120 m lower. There were glaciers in Tasmania. The lakes started to dry.<br /> 20,000 years ago. Glaciers thaw and rainfall decreases. The Lachlan River abandons the Willandra channel and the lakes never fill again. Lunette building begins. The water around the floodplains thickened with mud and clay. When the lake was full, the wave action pushed sand onto the leeward shore. Wind transported the sand onto the shore to form the big sandbanks called lunettes.<br /> About 31,000 years ago, it is believed that the Earth&#8217;s north-south axis moved 120 degrees from its present position and returned again over several thousands of years.<br /> 10,000 years ago. Semiarid. Stable for the next 10,000 years. The lunettes begin to erode.<br /> 1850. Europeans arrive. By 1880, overstocking, rabbits and drought significantly decreased the vegetation. Many mammals go extinct. Erosion of the lunettes accelerates.<br /> Mungo NP was formed in 1979 and was declared a WHS in 1981.<br /> <em>The Meeting Place.</em> Aboriginals gather here.

The town is sometimes referred to as the &#8220;opal capital of the world&#8221; because of the quantity of precious opals that are mined there. Coober Pedy is renowned for its below-ground dwellings, called &#8220;dugouts&#8221;, which are built in this fashion due to the scorching daytime heat.<br /> The name is from <i>kupa piti</i>, usually translated as &#8220;whitefella – a hole in the ground&#8221;, relating to white people&#8217;s mining activities. <sup id="cite_ref-naessen_10-0" class="reference"></sup>The first European explorer was John McDouall Stuart in 1858. The town was established in 1915 when the first opal was discovered.<br /> it sits on beds of sandstone and siltstone 30 metres (98 ft) deep and topped with a stony, treeless desert. Very little plant life exists in town due to the region&#8217;s low rainfall, high cost of water, and lack of topsoil.<br /> The harsh summer desert temperatures mean that many residents prefer to live in caves bored into the hillsides (&#8220;dugouts&#8221;). A standard three-bedroom cave home with a lounge, kitchen, and bathroom can be excavated out of the rock in the hillside for a similar price to building a house on the surface. The town&#8217;s water supply is from a bore and treatment plant from the Great Artesian Basin. Problems with ageing pipes, high water losses, and lack of subsidies contribute to consumer water charges being the highest in South Australia.<br /> <sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"></sup><strong>Mining.</strong> By 1999, there were more than 250,000 mine shaft entrances in the area and a law discouraged large-scale mining by allowing each prospector a 165-square-foot (15.3 m<sup>2</sup>) claim.<sup id="cite_ref-natgeog_12-1" class="reference"></sup> Coober Pedy supplies most of the world&#8217;s gem-quality opal; it has over 70 opal fields.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"></sup> An opalized fossil skeleton of an Umoonasaurus is in the Australian Museum.<br /> <sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"></sup>The Prominent Hill Mine, 130 km southeast of Coober Pedy is a copper-gold mine.

The peninsula is separated from Kangaroo Island to the south by Investigator Strait. The most populous town in the region is Kadina.<br /> Home to the Narungga people comprised of four clans.<br /> Most of Yorke Peninsula is prime agricultural land, with mostly small rolling hills and flat plains. The southern tip, sometimes termed the &#8220;foot&#8221;, is surrounded on three sides by the ocean, and forms a 170,000-hectare isolated &#8220;mainland island&#8221;, with large tracts of excellent native vegetation. The southwestern tip is occupied by Dhilba Guuranda-Innes National Park.<br /> Yorke Peninsula is a major producer of grain, particularly barley. Historically this has been sent out by sea because there are no rail services. A deep-water port was opened in 1970 near the south-eastern tip at Port Giles to export grain in bulk.<br /> <em>I drove about 20 km into the peninsula &#8211; about halfway to Androssan, the first town. Androssan has a deep water port and cliffs of red clay. Grain is the major industry, there is no beach and fishing is the main tourist draw.

It is the only mansion on North Terrace to have survived.<br /> The two-story mansion is constructed of local bluestone and is Regency period in style. Originally a 9-room brick house, it was transformed it into a 40-room mansion mainly during the 1860s. It is well preserved. Internally, the rooms feature hand-painted ceilings, stencilled woodwork, and memorabilia from the Ayers family, demonstrating the wealth of the owners at the time it was built. Ayers also commissioned a basement to escape the hot Adelaide summers.<br /> The house has had many uses, including a club for injured soldiers from 1918 to 1922, and an open-air café from 1914 to 1932.

They are a superb illustration of the key stages of the evolution of Australia’s unique mammals during the last 30 million years.<br /> Australia is regarded as the most biologically distinctive continent in the world, an outcome of its almost total isolation for 35 million years following its separation from Antarctica. Only two of its seven orders of singularly distinctive marsupial mammals have ever been recorded elsewhere.<br /> <strong>Riversleigh</strong>. Older fossils from the Oligocene to Miocene, some 10-30 million years ago. They demonstrate changes in habitat from humid, lowland rainforest to dry eucalypt forests and woodlands and provide the first fossil record for marsupial moles and feather-tailed possums.<br /> Just before the roadhouse is a road signed for Riverslsligh WHS. But it turned out to be a 445 km drive via Gregory, all gravel after Gregory (not a practical way to get there as it is much shorter from Camooweal past Mount Isa).<br /> The site is scattered over a large area &#8211; section D is where some important finds have been made.

Fossils from the glacial periods of the mid-Pleistocene to the current day (from 530,000 years ago to the present) illustrate their response to climate change and to human impacts. Included are superbly preserved Australian ice age megafauna (giant, now extinct mammals, birds, and reptiles), such as the enigmatic extinct marsupial lion. Also, modern species include marsupials such as the Tasmanian devil, Tasmanian tiger, wallabies, and possums; placental mammals including mice and bats; and snakes, lizards, frogs, and turtles. They span the probable time of arrival of humans to Australia.<br /> Pre-booked online (37$) for the Victoria Fossil Cave guided tour (1 hr at 10:15 and 2:15).

Diprotodon statue, an ancestor of wombat and Koala bear is the largest mammal found here and is buffalo-like.<br /> <em>Victoria Fossil Cave</em> (1.5km), the temperature inside the cave is a constant 17. Two parts, the normal cave tour with lovely stalactites and stalagmites, and the fossil bed tour. The highlight is the fossil deposit first discovered in 2069 almost 100 years after the cave was first discovered when they were looking for guano. The first part that is seen has many visible bones, is one metre deep and is not being excavated (part of the UNESCO agreement) and a cave stretching back 65 metres. Most of the animals found here ended up in this dark pit because they fell incidentally through eight openings in the ceiling of the cave. The most important are the large rainbow serpent, Wonambi naracoortensis, believed to have inhabited the dark cave and which preyed upon the unfortunate mammals which fell in the cave, and the Marsupial Lion, Thylacoleo carnifex, which had a very peculiar jaw bone and human-like fingers. The sediment is in cones that are layered depending on the dryness of the soil in the interglacial periods &#8211; dry and light during the glacial periods and dark during the wetter periods. This section is being actively excavated but is expected to take another 300 years to finish as the layers are up to 8 metres deep. The scientist in charge has been for 35 years.<br /> 120 different species have been found. The wonombi (rainbow snake) is a giant 5 m-long snake. The skeletons of two of the most impressive species found here have been put together. One is from a marsupial lion, and the other is from a leaf-eating kangaroo that lived in the trees (one of nine species of such kangaroos that has been found). The megafauna went extinct 60,000 years ago here whereas in Queensland they lasted until 20,000 years ago.<br /> Millions of fossils &#8211; 30% of extinct megafauna, 93 species of vertebrates &#8211; ranging from the Tasmanian Devil to wallabies, extinct mammals, and even turtles.

I have been retired since 2006 and in that time have traveled every winter for four to seven months. The months that I am "home", are often also spent on the road, hiking or kayaking.
