But there still seem to be no speed cameras on the highway. Road trains up to 55 m long remain common. Rest areas are less common than in Queensland and the Northern Territory.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>In Kununurra, I stopped at the Visitors Information and worked on this in the air conditioning. I then went for dinner and did some shopping preparing to drive towards the entrance of Purnululu, about a 250 km drive. </em></span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">ON Swing Creek rest area.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Day 19</strong> Sat Oct 7</span><br /> <em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Up at 3, I finished the 100 km drive to the entrance road to the park.

The spectacular black and orange banded appearance is formed by biological processes of cyanobacteria (single-cell photosynthetic organisms) which serve to stabilise and protect the ancient sandstone formations. The process of cone karst formation on sandstone &#8211; a phenomenon recognised by geomorphologists only recently is still not completely understood. These outstanding examples of cone karst that have eroded over a period of 20 million years are of great beauty and exceptional geological interest.<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="img-fluid" src="https://www.dbca.wa.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/feature_large_850x425/public/2022-11/purnululu_national_park_sean_scott_photography.jpg?itok=DBJrQKr2" alt="Purnululu National Park. Photo by Sean Scott Photography" width="900" height="450" /></span></p><div class="border-top pt-4 mt-4"><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Unique depositional processes and weathering have given these towers their spectacular black and orange banded appearance that undergo remarkable daily and seasonal variation in appearance, including striking colour transitions following rain and with the positioning of the sun.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The intricate maze of towers is accentuated by sinuous, narrow, sheer-sided gorges lined with majestic <em>Livistona</em> fan palms. These and the soaring cliffs up to 250 metres high are cut by seasonal waterfalls and pools, with evocative names such as Echidna Chasm, Piccaninny and Cathedral Gorges.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Temperatures within the park and on the walk trails can reach 40°C (104°F) and radiant heat can increase the temperature to over 50°C (122°F).</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Get in.</strong> Visitors must carry in all water, food, fuel and other supplies. You will need supplies for three days (even if you are staying one) and enough fuel for a minimum of 300km. Purnululu National Park covers vast distances, so a day trip is not recommended.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Spring Creek Track into Purnululu National Park is 53km from the Great Northern Highway and can only be accessed by high clearance 4WD from April to November (subject to weather and road conditions), which can take up to 1.5-2 hours to drive.  The track is natural earth, not paved or sealed and is corrugated, winding and has hills and creek crossings.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Drive slowly and carefully. The maximum speed limit is 50km per hour. Drive to conditions and look out for livestock and wildlife. Reduce tyre pressure for a smoother ride. Single axle towable units only. Dual axle towable units are not permitted.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Download the free Emergency+ app before your visit which can be used in the event of any emergency to call for assistance. If there is no mobile phone coverage you WILL NOT be able to call 000 but the app will provide you with GPS location details.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Both Lodges, the Purnululu Visitor Centre and Piccaninny Gorge Overnight Hike closed for the 2023 season after 30 September. All Purnululu National Park remains open to visitors.

A mixed black flying fox and little red flying fox colony of around 50,000 megabats live all year in mangroves.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Pearling. First settled in 1883 due to the pearling industry, which initially involved slavery and indentured labour, pearl diving being an occupation reserved for specific ethnic groups, most prominently from Japan and followed by other Asian countries. Asians, especially Japanese, excelled at pearl diving, with many of them becoming valued citizens in the town. Pearling was a dangerous and sometimes deadly occupation and the town&#8217;s Japanese cemetery is the resting place of 919 Japanese divers who lost their lives working in the industry.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">This led to numerous racially motivated conflicts, most notably the 1920 race riots between Japanese and Malay residents, resulting in 8 deaths and at least 60 injuries. <sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"></sup>The Broome community came to &#8220;reflect the hierarchy of the pearling industry, which was based on occupation and ethnicity&#8221;. <sup id="cite_ref-PlaceReport2011_11-0" class="reference"></sup>White-collar occupations and positions of power were exclusively held by Europeans.

It is a narrow peninsula of land extending approximately 22 kilometres from the mainland, a group of 42 islands, islets and rocks and the surrounding sea up to 40 kilometres from the port of Dampier (Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation 2016).  With more than one million images in an area of more than 37,000 hectares, Murujuga is home to one of the most significant and diverse collections of petroglyphs in the world which documents the transition of an arid maritime cultural landscape through time. Murujuga has the densest known concentration of hunter-gatherer petroglyphs anywhere in the world.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The songs and mythologies for many of the images, such as Minyuburru (Seven Sisters), the fruit bat and Archaic Face, have important meanings. Archaic Faces.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The <em>Ngurra-ra Ngarli</em> first started living and using this part of the Pilbara coastal plain around 50,000 years ago, when the coastline was about 100 kilometres away. At that time Murujuga was wetter and warmer than it is now. The faunal assemblage is no longer found in this part of Australia, such as nail-tailed wallabies and crocodiles. During the last ice age (between 30,000 and 18,000 years ago), when the coastline was 160 kilometres away, <em>Ngurra-ra Ngarli</em> lived in the Murujuga Ranges as well as other desert refugia. A number of petroglyphs of animals are now extinct, such as thylacines (Tasmanian Tiger) and a fat-tailed species of kangaroo. More recent petroglyphs depict fish, turtles, dugongs and small marsupials that now live on the islands.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The many stone features of Murujuga include standing stones, fish traps, stone arrangements, hunting hides and domestic structures.

With its islands and the land surrounding it, has three exceptional natural features:</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">1. Vast <strong>sea-grass beds</strong> at the Wooramel Seagrass Bank, which are the largest (4,800 km2) and richest in the world. Seagrasses are aquatic flowering plants that form meadows in near-shore brackish or marine waters in temperate and tropical regions, producing one of the world’s most productive aquatic ecosystems. Australia has one of the highest diversity of seagrasses globally, with 12 species occurring in the Bay.<br /> It is one of the few marine areas in the world dominated by carbonates not associated with reef-building corals. Limestone sands are formed by the precipitation of calcium carbonate from hypersaline waters.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Sea grass beds are a haven for marine species, including Green Turtle and Loggerhead Turtle (one of Australia’s most important nesting areas for loggerheads). Increasing numbers of Humpback Whales and Southern Right Whales use Shark Bay as a migratory staging post, and a famous population of Bottlenose Dolphin lives in the Bay. Large numbers of sharks and rays are readily observed, including the Manta Ray.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">2. <strong>Dugong</strong> (‘sea cow’). Shark Bay is one of the world’s most significant and secure strongholds for the protection of Dugong, with a population of around 11,000.<br /> 3. <strong>Stromatolites</strong> (colonies of microbial/algae mats that form hard, dome-shaped deposits which are said to be the oldest life forms on earth and are comparable to living fossils, the first modern, living examples) that the property is most renowned. Analogous structures dominated marine ecosystems on Earth for more than 3,000 million years initially in Proterozoic seas. They are one of the world’s best examples of a living analogue for the study of the nature and evolution of the earth’s biosphere up until the early Cambrian. The hydrologic structure of Shark Bay, altered by the formation of the Faure Sill and a high evaporation,has produced a steep gradient in salinities, creating three biotic zones that have a marked effect on the distribution and abundance of marine organisms. Hamelin Pool&#8217;s hypersaline water (almost twice that of seawater) and contributed to extensive beaches consisting entirely of shells.  The profusion of peninsulas, islands and bays create a diversity of landscapes and exceptional coastal scenery.<br /> Shark Bay is a refuge for many globally threatened species of plants and animals. Located at the transition zone between two of Western Australia’s main botanical provinces, the arid Eremaean, dominated by <em>Acacia</em> species and the temperate South West, dominated by <em>Eucalyptus </em>species are at the limit of their southern or northern range. The property contains either the only or major populations of five globally threatened mammals, including the Burrowing Bettong (now classified as Near Threatened), Rufous Hare Wallaby, Banded Hare Wallaby, the Shark Bay Mouse and the Western Barred Bandicoot.<br /> Shark Bay is 847km north of Perth or a flight on Regional Express Airlines to a 15 minute drive from the Airport to Monkey Mia.</span></h3><div class="box"><div class="tab-content"><div id="contentdes_en" class="tab-pane fade active show " role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tabdes_en"><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong><em>Two Wheel Drive Access</em><br /> Hamelin Bay.</strong> Indicate what the earth may have looked like about 3.5 billion years ago when stromatolites grew widespread across the water.

The water at Shell Beach is very salty, making it easy to float for those who aren’t strong swimmers &#8211; similar to the Dead Sea in Jordan.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the early 1900s, the shells were quarried and hard packed, cut into blocks and used to construct a number of historic buildings in the nearby town of Denham, some of which can still be seen today such as the Old Pearler Restaurant.</span></p><div class="ImageText container container-sm my-8 md:my-12"><div class="md:flex md:space-x-10 lg:space-x-24 md:items-center aos-init aos-animate" data-aos="fade-up"><figure class="relative md:w-1/2 max-w-xs mx-auto lg:max-w-sm overflow-hidden mb-12 md:mb-0"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><img decoding="async" class="w-full ls-is-cached lazyloaded" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets.australiascoralcoast.com/images/Shell-Beach-shell-loveheart.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fit=crop&amp;fm=webp&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5&amp;h=768&amp;q=80&amp;w=768 768w, https://assets.australiascoralcoast.com/images/Shell-Beach-shell-loveheart.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fit=crop&amp;fm=webp&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5&amp;h=640&amp;q=80&amp;w=640 640w, https://assets.australiascoralcoast.com/images/Shell-Beach-shell-loveheart.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fit=crop&amp;fm=webp&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5&amp;h=380&amp;q=80&amp;w=380 380w" alt="Shell Beach shell loveheart" data-srcset="https://assets.australiascoralcoast.com/images/Shell-Beach-shell-loveheart.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fit=crop&amp;fm=webp&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5&amp;h=768&amp;q=80&amp;w=768 768w, https://assets.australiascoralcoast.com/images/Shell-Beach-shell-loveheart.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fit=crop&amp;fm=webp&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5&amp;h=640&amp;q=80&amp;w=640 640w, https://assets.australiascoralcoast.com/images/Shell-Beach-shell-loveheart.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fit=crop&amp;fm=webp&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5&amp;h=380&amp;q=80&amp;w=380 380w" data-sizes="100vw" /></span></figure></div></div><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Eagle Bluff. </strong>Has a boardwalk to look down on rays and fish.<strong><br /> Little Lagoon </strong>is on the outskirts of the National Park just 2 km from Denham and accessible by 2WD.

They reflected the beliefs about the punishment of crime in 18th and 19th century Europe for the harshness of the punishment used as a deterrent, and of the aim of social rehabilitation through labour and discipline. </span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The convict settlements simultaneously led to the Aboriginal population being forced back into the less fertile hinterland, and to the creation of a significant source of population of European origin.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The structural integrity depends on the site, especially ones with lengthy periods of abandonment.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The sites included in the serial listing are:</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Kingston and Arthur’s Vale Historic Area,</em> Norfolk Island (1788–1814 and 1824–1855)</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Old Government House and Domain,</em> Parramatta Park, New South Wales (1788–1856)</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Hyde Park Barracks,</em> Sydney, New South Wales (1819–1848)</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Brickendon—Woolmers Estates,</em> Longford, Tasmania (1820–1850s)</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Darlington Probation Station</em>, Maria Island National Park, Tasmania (1825–1832 and 1842–1850)</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Old Great North Road,</em> Wiseman’s Ferry, New South Wales (1828–1835)</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Cascades Female Factory</em>, South Hobart, Tasmania (1828–1856)</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Port Arthur Historic Site,</em> Port Arthur, Tasmania (1830–1877)</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Coal Mines Historic Site</em>, Norfolk Bay, Tasmania (1833–1848)</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Cockatoo Island Convict Site,</em> Sydney, New South Wales (1839–1869)</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Fremantle Prison,</em> Fremantle, Western Australia (1852–1886)</span><br /> <strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">My experience: </span></strong><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Fremantle Prison.</em> About 10,000 convicts were at Freemantle. Of all the convict sites, only Freemantle appears to be intact and certainly the most interesting. There are three main tours a.Convict Prison Tour (1850-1886) </span>b.

We heard the induction process, the kitchen, exercise areas, and all four of the cell blocks with examples of every cell from the convict days through to the 1991 closure. Legal people and sex offenders were housed separately. Working in the kitchen was the most coveted job. There were never toilets in the prison and buckets were used.</p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>MANDURAH<br /> Mandurah War Memorial.</strong> A large memorial next to the water. There are four flag poles, 15 cement columns and a long stone wall listing all the conflicts Australia has been involved in since the 1885 Sudan episode, Boer War 1899-1903, WWI 1914-17, WWII 1939-45, Vietnam </span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">ON Mandurah War Memorial parking lot.<br /> Mileage 115 km </span></span></p><p><strong>Day 25</strong> Sat Oct 14<br /> <em>I spent the morning getting caught up on my WA post and Nomad Mania sites.</em> <strong style="font-size: 12pt;">BUNBURY<br /> </strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Bunbury Lighthouse.</strong> A very tall LH with an attractive black/white checked paint job.

Free </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Wonnerup House,</strong> Wonnerup. </span>The current house was built in 1859 by George Layman Jr. one year after the original house built in 1837 by his father, George Layman Sr., was destroyed by fire. The dairy and kitchen survived the fire and the sables and a blacksmith workshop were later additions. In the 1870s, George Layman Jr. donated land near Wonnerup House for a school, which was built in 1873.<br /> In 1827 George Layman, then 17 years old, immigrated to Australia from England and settled in Van Diemen&#8217;s Land, Tasmania, with his brother Charles. In 1829, Layman was attacked and robbed of all his money by escaped convicts, and left for the Swan River Colony, in 1829.<br /> Relations between the European settlers and the native Wardandi people were strained. In 1841, George Layman was speared to death by Wardandi elder Gaywal. A manhunt for Layman&#8217;s killer and an unknown number of Aboriginals were killed. The posse eventually shot Gaywal and two of his sons were imprisoned on Rottnest Island.<br /> <sup id="cite_ref-chronicle_1-5" class="reference"></sup>In 1858, the Layman cottage burned to the ground and 20-year-old George Layman Jr. built the current Wonnerup House. In the 1880s and 1890s, Wonnerup House was one of the district&#8217;s most lucrative dairy farms. At its peak, the farm had an area of over 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres). In 1962, with the death of the last Layman sister,<sup id="cite_ref-chronicle_1-10" class="reference"></sup> the farm was sold and acquired by the National Trust of Australia in 1971.<br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The house is a narrow, long stone structure that has been whitewashed. The roof was damaged and all the furniture was removed except for a cheese press. $10, 7 reduced</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Busselton<br /> </strong></span><strong>Leeuwin-Naturaliste NP.</strong> Named after the two locations at either end of the park which have lighthouses, Cape Leeuwin and Cape Naturaliste, it is the busiest national park in Western Australia with 2.33 million visitors through 2008–2009.<br /> <sup id="cite_ref-2012plan_2-0" class="reference"></sup>The park extends over 100 miles, from Cape Naturaliste in the north to Cape Leeuwin in the south. It is composed of 28 fragmented separate reserves, some only a narrow coastal strip. It has many limestone and granite outcrops, beaches with well-known surf breaks  (Supertubes, Yallingup Beach, and Smiths Beach), coastal cliffs, aeolian dunes and caves, Leeuwin-Naturaliste Ridge runs north and south parallel to the coast and is composed of coastal dune limestone and the Margaret Plateau composed of granitic and anorthositic gneisses.<br /> <strong>Cape Naturaliste Lighthouse.</strong> Sitting on a bluff 100 m above the water, it has panoramic views over 270°.

On the last one, I detoured to the Valley of the Giants with a fallen giant 400-year-old Tingle that fell in 1990 and now forms the basis of the Tree Top Walk (400 m long, 40 m above the ground, $21, 15.5 reduced).</em><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Mandalay Beach.</strong> A golden beach with very fine sand, about 15 km off the highway where it turns east to go towards Walpole. Good dirt road. Not at all touristy with few people. Can&#8217;t swim due to the big rip currents. Go for the beach and coast scenery. </span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;"><b>ALBANY<br /> </b></span><strong>Museum of the Great Southern. </strong>Only the permanent exhibit building was open.

It appears that the original would have looked around 1950 BC. It consists of 137 stones of Esperance Pink Granite that were all quarried locally less than 1 km away.<br /> 10 Inner Trilithon Stones form a horseshoe and weigh between 28-50 tonnes each with an 18-tonne lintel laying over each pair reaching a height of 8 metres. Inside the Trilithon Horseshoe stands another smaller horseshoe of 19 blue stones. Lying at the base of the tallest Trilithon Stone lies the Altar Stone which weighs 9 tonnes.<br /> Outside the Trilithon Horseshoe lies a circle of 40 smaller stones that are referred to as the Bluestone Circle. The perimeter consists of 30 Sarsen Stones weighing 28 tonnes each with 8-tonne lintels lining the top. Together they reach a height of nearly 5 metres.<br /> The Stonehenge was built to align with the Solstices here in Esperance. On the morning of the Summer Solstice (21st or 22nd December), the sun&#8217;s rays align with the Heel Stones and shine through to the altar stone. The sunset of the Winter Solstice (21st June) repeats the same alignment in reverse. $14, 12 reduced</p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Esperance Bay and Cape Le Grand National Park.</strong> It was 43 km from Stonehenge to Lucky Bay and I don&#8217;t think it was worth the drive but I had already driven 15 km out of my way to get to Stonehenge. Entrance fee $15. Pass Frenchman Peak with a huge arch on its top. <strong><br /> Lucky Bay.</strong> The campground was full and the picnic parking lot was full.
