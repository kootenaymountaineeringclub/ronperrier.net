I got Google Mapped as it took a very direct route, first on a winding road, the Bairnsdale-Dargo Road C601 and after Dargo a narrow paved road that climbed up slowly with a lot of construction. I groaned when I hit gravel through Alpine National Park, basically on the top of the world here &#8211; the Dargo High Plains road. Of variable quality, it lasted 48 km, changed to paved and finally joined the Great Alpine Highway which now looked like a freeway. It descended on a very winding road for many km until Harrietville and finally levelled out at Bright, a gorgeous town with big trees lining the highway. </em></p><p><strong>ALBURY-WODONGA<br /> </strong>Albury is very pretty with buildings from the 1850s and a lot of Art Deco. A large cenotaph is on top of the big hill to the west giving good views of the city.<br /> <strong>Albury Botanic Gardens.</strong> Small but lovely &#8211; roses, children&#8217;s garden, palms, lawns and some large trees: sweet gum, Kauri pine, bunya bunya pine, lemon scented gum and Atlas cedar. Free<br /> <strong>Murray Art Museum.</strong> Not a terrible lot of interest. A photograph exhibit (along with many artifacts he had collected) showed poor compostion and light selection. Free<br /> <strong>Albury Library Museum.</strong> A gallery in the public library with exhibits on the Dr Cleaver family, photos of the city, 50 years of rock photography, KLM plane almost crash, Margaret Court, Europeans and aboriginals. Free<br /> 128 km to Wagga Wagga.<br /> ON Wayside in the town of Gerogery, very nice especially when the lights came on over my covered picnic table. I stopped early as all the sites in Wagga were closed and I had a lot of catching up to do, especially my Nauru visa (finally paid for using Wise where I found a CA$30).<br /> Mileage: 339 km</p><p><strong>Day 58</strong> Thur Nov 16<br /> <strong>WAGGA WAGGA<br /> Museum of the Riverina</strong>. In the old city council chambers (lovingly restored in the museum), there are exhibits on feral dogs and cats, and old photos demonstrating land use climate change, and the effect of agriculture. There were also many astrophotography photos, apparently from some competition (they were very good). Free<br /> <strong>Wagga Wagga Botanic Gardens.</strong> Possibly the least inspiring BG I have seen &#8211; mostly brownish grass, trees, and a rose garden. Free<br /> <strong>RAAF Wagga Heritage Centre.</strong> 9 km east of Wagga, this is on an airforce base (and staffed by soldiers) with many photos and vignettes of pilots (often with their donated gear). Profile of the Beaufighters, pilots flying a specific plane. Female soldiers and WWII history along with all the other wars Australia has gotten involved in with the US. Technical school. There are 5 planes outside &#8211; one bomber (the Canberra built in Australia) and four fighters. Free</p><p><strong>Dog on the Tuckerbox,</strong> Gundagai. A 1932 monument at a roadside store/restaurant, it is a nondescript black dog sitting on a green tuckerbox (lunchbox) on a double stone plinth in the middle of a hexagonal pool. The inscription says &#8220;PIONEER MONUMENT GUNDAGAI&#8221; &#8220;EARTH&#8217;S SELF UPHOLDS THIS MONUMENT TO CONQUERERS WHO WON HER WHEN WOOING WAS DANGEROUS AND NOW ARE GATHERED UNTO HER AGE&#8221;<br /> The story goes: In the 1850s, Bill the Bullocky, a teamster on the road to Gundagai was crossing 9-Mile Creek with his bullock team and wagon and became hopelessly stuck. On trying to pull the wagon out, the wagon yoke broke. To top it off, his dog was &#8220;on strike&#8221; sitting on his tucker box. The other bullockies thought the incident was a great joke. Bowyang Yorke penned a poem about the incident in 1857 and the story spread. A song was written in 1937 and became very popular. (I personally don&#8217;t get the joke &#8211; only Australians do?)<br /> 3000 people attended the unveiling of the small monument and government ministers attended the 50th and 75th anniversary of the original unveling (plaques attest to this). Throw money into the pond for good luck with the proceeds going to the hospital.<br /> The drive here was throgh endless what field and in the rolling hills, pasture. I think this is one of the prettiest parts of Australia with all the golden grass and wheat, individual trees on a hilly landscape.<br /> ON Wayside between Wagga Wagga and Canberra. The black flies are a menace.<br /> Mileage: 200 km 8844</p><p><strong>GO TO CANBERRA</strong><br /> ==============================================================</p><p><strong>RETURN FROM CANBERRA AND NSW INLAND</strong></p><p><strong>AUSTRALIA &#8211; NEW SOUTH WALES &#8211; EASTERN (Sydney, Newcastle)</strong></p><p><strong>Murramarang NP. Mt Agony.<br /> </strong>ON Ulladulla Marina area. Nice covered tables but very bright lights at night. No bathroom.<br /> Mileage:</p><p><strong>Day 61</strong> Sun Nov 19<br /> <em>I continued my drive north towards Sydney.</em></p><p><strong>JERVIS BAY TERRITORY<br /> </strong><strong>Booderee NP. </strong>On Jervis Bay and St Georges Basin, it is mostly about the beach. The inland is scrub forest. Contains Jervis Bay Village, Booderee Botanical Gardens, several short walks (St Georges Head, Cape St George, Cave Beach), and three campgrounds. $15  <strong><br /> </strong><strong>Hyams Beach. </strong>A long white sand beach on Jervis Bay, it runs from Booderae NP to Jervis Bay NP. Several small rocky headlands. On a windy day, there was fair surf. Very popular and parking is almost impossible. <strong><br /> </strong><strong>Jervis Bay NP. </strong>This has 2 inland sections (mostly scrub), and this short section is over 1 km long along the ocean. There is a nice forest with big gum trees,<strong><br /> Greenfield Beach. </strong>On Jervis Bay in Jervis Bay NP (and separated from Hyams Beach by 1.5 km of coast Jervis Bay NP &#8211; 15-minute trail), it is a 10 km drive through the town of Vicentia. It is deep white sand, about 200 m long, and a lovely day area with many tables.</p><p><b>Meroogal,</b> Nowra. Built in 1886, for the Thorburn family whose 4 generations of descendants (the Macgregors) lived in it until 1985, it is a two-story Victorian house with verandahs, original hardwood floors, a servants wing and many mementoes of the family. It remains in good condition with some of the original furniture. The property is much smaller than the original and the gardens are 1/10th the size of the original. Free</p><dl></dl><p><strong>Berry.</strong> Small Town<br /> <strong>Nan Tien Temple,</strong> Berkeley. A Buddhist temple dedicated to Avalakutesvaia Bodhisattva. Originally male, when Buddhism arrived in China, she became female. Has 16 arms each holding a weapon and is backed by the 1000 arms crest. The temple site also has a large 7-story pagoda.</p><p><strong>WOLLONGONG<br /> Breakwater Battery,</strong> Port Kembla. There are two gun placements (batteries) overlooking the ocean. It is near the large breakwater. An art installation of many small white &#8220;pyramids&#8221; is between the two batteries. <strong><br /> Illawarra Museum.</strong> In the old post office, this is a history museum for Wollongong and Illawarra. It has a classroom (desks sit 2 per desk), a magneto telephone, many historical photos of Wollongong and Illawara, many old artifacts, blacksmiths, old carriages (with plastic horses), laundry, kitchen, a homestead house, a bedroom and sitting room upstairs. Free<br /> <strong>Wollongong Art Gallery.</strong> In the old city council chambers, there are 4 stories of local art, watercolours and a wide assortment of techniques. There is a good Holocaust exhibit with vignettes of many of the people who helped Jews escape. I got into a discussion with the curator of this about Israel and Palestine.<br /> <strong>Science Space.</strong> I dislike these as they are so kid-orientated. I arrived 20 minutes before closing and the young woman at the desk let me in without paying. True to form, there was little here of interest to adults (except maybe a video on the space station). $16, reduced $14 but free.<br /> <strong>Wollongong Botanic Garden.</strong> Very large, the north end is mostly a large area of grass and some big trees. Two creeks run down the center producing a lovely temperate rainforest. Other gardens are succulent, and arid, with palms, many beds of bushes and flowers with a fairly large pond. Very nice. Free<br /> <strong>Wollongong Breakwater Lighthouse.</strong> Built in 1937, it is 25 m tall and has always been automated. Sitting on Flagstaff Hill at a sharp point, the water below is a boiling mass over the rocks. Made of reinforced concrete, it is a lovely Art Deco design with arches at the bottom, narrow vertical ribs extending most of the length, and a geometric design on the band below the light.<br /> Several people insist on feeding seagulls with a hundred frantic birds. The lady next to my car was feeding them with the birds shitting all over my car. I told her to stop feeding the birds bread. &#8220;it&#8217;s not bread, it&#8217;s chips&#8221;!!!!!<br /> ON In the lovely lot just below the lighthouse. I had dinner in the lee of the hill out of the strong wind.<br /> Mileage: 9512</p><p><strong>Day 62</strong> Mon Nov 20<br /> <strong>Sea Cliff Bridge,</strong> Clifton. On the seaside road on the way to Sydney, this is a 605 m-long bridge built on piers separated from the steep rock wall to avoid rock falls. It was built over a previous coal colliery and rocky shore of the ocean in 2004-5 using 60,000 tons of rock to build the sea level access and 11,000 cubic metres of cement. The piers are protected from corrosion using an impressed electrical current. Many people park and walk the bridge. It is 21 km north of Wollongong and quite out of the way.</p><p><strong>CAMPBELLTOWN</strong><br /> <strong>St John the Evangelist Catholic Church,</strong> Campbelltown. Built in 1836, this all-brick church has a steep A-frame-like roof, nice stained glass on the sides and a rose window.<br /> <strong>The Australian Botanic Garden Mount Annan</strong>. A huge garden with only Australian plants is seen by driving on a one-way narrow 30km/hr road. See the Woodland garden, plant bank and Herbarium (many greenhouses), bottlebrush garden, wattle garden, banksia garden, and red gum gardens, each with special plantings. Each garden has a large parking area and picnic shelters. Several paved paths are for walking and cycling. Free<br /> <strong>Rotary Observatory,</strong> Campbelltown. These are two tiny domes on a small hill surrounded by a park-like setting in a residential neighbourhood. Owned by the University of Western Sydney, they were built in 2000 for the Sydney Olympics. There is no information and they couldn&#8217;t be visited. One has the label &#8220;Laser and Illumination Lab&#8221;.<br /> <strong>Mount Gilead Mill,</strong> Gilead:   The windmill at the Mt Gilead property on Appin Road was built by Thomas Rose in 1836. The mill tower, which is built from sandstone quarried on the property, is 60 feet in height, comprises four stories, and is reputed to have contained the finest millstones in the colony. No metal was used in its construction and all the moving parts were fashioned from ironbark grown on the property. The tapering stone tower was topped by a moveable cap made of wood (as the sails had to be always facing into the wind, the moveable cap carried the sails and driving shaft). A stone wall surrounded the windmill, to protect animals from touching the rotating sails.<br /> Mount Gilead is the last remaining tower mill in New South Wales.<br /> <strong>Camden Museum of Aviation,</strong> Harrington Park. Not open on Mondays<br /> <strong>Australian Aviation Museum,</strong> Bankstown. Permanently closed.</p><p><strong>WEST OF SYDNEY</strong><br /> <strong>Lakemba Mosque.</strong> A large rectangle covered in cream brick with many arches, a single minaret and a green dome. Inside is a gaudy blue with calligraphy in the dome and one wall. Unusually, the mihrab is in a corner, covered in tiles with a stair minbar.<br /> <strong>Parramatta Hospital Archaeological Site.</strong> Vestiges of the Past. Initially a tent hospital in 1790, the Parramatta District Hospital was built in 1818 as a colonial hospital, a 2-story building with 4 wards (men and women were separated). Each ward was 30 m X 6 m with 2.4 m high ceilings and was described as overcrowded, dark and damp with dysentery common. Going here was described as a death sentence. Many died. It served convicts who built the community of Rose Hill (name later changed to Parramatta).<br /> From 1848-1902, it was the Parramatta District Hospital (with no convicts), from 1896-1901, the Sulman Power Cottage and in the 1950s, Jeffrie House.<br /> The site is a large glass and metal frame rectangle with the foundation walls exposed and three glass cases with archaeological findings.<br /> <strong>Woolpack Hotel. Parramatta.</strong> Originating in 1796, it is the oldest continuously operating bar in Australia (one in Hobart might argue). Three stories on the corner and one story on the sides. Now has a casino (slot machines), a nice bar and a restaurant. Historic photos in the dining room &#8211; one says &#8220;The Birthplace of Bowls in New South Wales&#8221;. Supposedly there are rooms but I didn&#8217;t ask.<br /> <strong>Elizabeth Farm</strong>, Rosehill. Dating from 1793, it is the oldest surviving homestead in Australia. Today there is a stone 2-story house (painted yellow) with furniture as period as possible, an outside kitchen, and a work shed. The gardens are lovely. On either side is the Elizabeth Reserve, a park with grass and trees.<br /> <strong>Gallipoli Mosque</strong>, Auburn. A grand mosque with two minarets and a &#8220;wedding cake&#8221; design in 5 layers ascending to the 8 small silver domes and finally a large silver dome. Inside is a riot of calligraphy and design lining the dome (red/green stained glass and round white stars in red circles), walls and columns. A balcony goes all the way around. The minbar is very tall. It has a youth centre on the side.<br /> <strong>Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway.</strong> This is a gorgeous tribute built in 1996. Large marble storyboards, each relating a stage of battle on the tract, line a cement walkway in a very nice long park bordering a river. In the center is a semicircle of three marble walls with incised pictures. I read about 10 but still find it very confusing as there were so many retreats and advances by both sides. Basically, the Japanese were using the track (starting in Kokoda) to capture Port Moresby with the Australians eventually preventing them from doing so.<br /> I saw the Kokoda Tract cemetery outside Port Moresby (read about the battles there).<br /> ON In the lovely parking area of the Kokoda Track Memorial. The Rotary has built a lovely covered area with 6 picnic tables, a BBQ, bathrooms and an Education Centre. This may have been the nicest overnight spot in all of Australia. No black flies.</p><p><strong>Day 63</strong> Tue Nov 21<br /> <em>I continued my drive about to see all the NM sites in Sydney proper. </em></p><p><strong>SYDNEY </strong>(pop 5,297,089) is the capital city of New South Wales, and the most populous city in Australia. Located on Australia&#8217;s east coast, the metropolis surrounds Sydney Harbour and extends about 70 km (43.5 mi) towards the Blue Mountains to the west, Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, Marramarra National Park and the Hawkesbury River to the north and north-west, and the Royal National Park and Macarthur to the south and south-west. Greater Sydney consists of 658 suburbs, spread across 33 local government areas.

The area gets its name from the blue haze which is caused by sunlight and fine droplets of eucalypt oil from the trees, dispersed into the atmosphere. The best time to experience this phenomenon is at sunrise or sunset on clear days.</p><p><strong>Wentworth Falls</strong>, a town before Katoomba. Turn 2 km past the town turnoff to the Wentworth Falls Overlook. From the overlook, a multitude of trails begin. Most walk down the falls trail and return, about 1 hour return. Here is the best route: Walk down the waterfall trail and cross the bridge below two small cascades. Continue to the National Pass trail and take the lower route that goes to a spectacular ledge that just gives a view of the main waterfall, that braids over a huge cliff. Return and walk down to the Fletcher&#8217;s Lookout which gives a view of the top of this main fall. Continue on the Under the Ledge trail, a fairly flat trail that passes several overhangs. Turn right to go up the Prince&#8217;s Rock trail and the lookout that gives a full-on view of the entire lower falls.

A long hike takes you down into the valley via the Giant Stairway and along the bottom of the cliffs, past waterfalls, and then back up further along. Giant Stairway is a lot of stairs, 25 minutes to Dardanelles Pass, a ridge about halfway.<br /> The heath on the clifftops appears to be pruned manually but is pruned by the wind to a uniform height and provides cover to a variety of birds and small mammals. The highlight bird sightings are the Yellow-tailed Black Cockatoo, the Channel-billed Cuckoo and the iconic Superb Lyrebird which features on the Blue Mountains NP logo.<em><br /> </em><strong>Katoomba. </strong>The downtown is nothing to see but one street has some nice older architecture including some Art Deco. <em><br /> </em><strong>Katoomba Scenic Railway,</strong> &#8220;the steepest incline railway in the world is like a rollercoaster as it descends at an angle of up to 45*<br /> Scenic World Cable Car is a tourist trap with no added value.<br /> <em>I walked from Ech0 Point to the overlook of the Three Sisters in 10 minutes. On a very overcast day, the valley was completely enshrouded in fog and mist and I could just barely see the second Sister. They are fairly impressive monoliths. Walk down the Giant&#8217;s Staircase 50 m on steep stairs to the base of Three Sisters and continue for 900 steep steps to the Dardanelles. Then return, about 1 1/2 hours. </em><br /> <em>On the way to the Sisters, pass the trail heads for the Prince Henry Cliff Walk &#8211; 1 hour to Leura Cascades and 2 hours to Gordon Falls (unfortunately most of the cliff walk is closed and much of the walking would be on the road). </em><br /> <em>If one goes the other direction from the Three Sisters, you reach Katoomba Falls and Scenic World. </em><br /> <em>The Federal Pass Trail (which starts at Wentworth Falls is below this entire set of trails and ends at Scenic World) 4 hours total one-way and only works well with a prearranged shuttle).<br /> </em>Parking in the Blue River Municipality (Katoomba) is ridiculous &#8211; $3 for 15 minutes. I took my chances and didn&#8217;t pay.</p><p><strong>Govetts Leap Lookout, </strong>Blackheath is another lookout and starting point for different hiking trails. The easiest trails are Pulpit Rock Trail (2.5km) which leads to Bridal Veil Falls and the Cliff Top Track to Evans Lookout Trail (6km) which leads to Wentworth Falls. Has a spectacular view of the Blue Gum Forest and Grose Valley Creek.<br /> There is a nice parking lot with covered picnic tables and a nice place to stay overnight.<br /> <strong>Blue Mountains Cultural Centre.</strong> Just before Govetts Leap, this is dedicated to the Greater Blue Mountains Area WHS. Don&#8217;t miss coming here to see two great videos, the spectacular photography of Stephan Georgiou ($1400 each), and the best explanations of the entire Blue Mountains.<br /> <strong>Jenolan Caves.<br /> </strong>The train between Glenbrook and Mount Victoria has amazing views at each stop and along the way.<br /> <em>I spent a huge part of the day sleeping and reading at Govett&#8217;s Leap Lookout. It rained heavily and the view didn&#8217;t clear till later in the afternoon. Opposite are great cliffs and a view straight downward to a creek. </em><br /> ON Wayside outside of Blackheath.</p><p><strong>Day 67</strong> Sun Nov 26<br /> <em>I started my drive back to Brisbane heading toward the coast of NSW north of Sydney.<br /> </em><strong>Macquarie Arms Hotel,</strong> Windsor. Built in 1815, it (along with at least two others I&#8217;ve visited) advertises itself as the oldest pub in Australia. Its name was changed to the Royal Hotel from 1874-1961. There are lots of photos, old advertisements and odd lists on the walls of the bar, lounge, and dining room. The Bistro restaurant was extremely popular on a Sunday with a long lineup to order. Seating in the lounge, dining room and outside. I returned in the late afternoon to eat (chicken schnitzel with mushroom sauce A$22).<br /> <strong>Australia Pioneer Village.</strong> It has loads of buildings moved from the area &#8211; bank, school, general store, church, farm machinery shed, many cottages dating from 1815 to the 1930s and several activities, most orientated to kids: animal feeding, spinning, butter churning, clothes washing, dress ups. $10, reduced $5.<br /> <strong>Cattai Homestead Windmill.</strong> This is hard to find and took a lot of driving and research on Google. Google Maps is of no help. Cattai is very rural, has no town and only several large houses on acreages. I drove about 6 km through hoping to see a windmill. I then Googled it and the Arndell&#8217;s Windmill comes up on Wiseman&#8217;s Ferry Road (the road I was on!!) in Cattai National Park, off to the north of Wiseman&#8217;s Ferry Road. It was the subject of archaeological research by the University of Sydney.<br /> Dr Thomas Arndell (1753-1821) retired from Parramattai Hospital in 1794 and was granted 240 hectares of land here in 1804 when he started the construction of a mill and granary (considered to be the first industrial building in Australia). The 4 m tall stone mill was also known as the convict&#8217;s mill as it was convicts who owned it. The mill was used as a safe place during floods. The area was known as &#8220;the granary of the colony&#8221; as it produced so much wheat. He started to build his homestead in the park in 1820 but died in 1821 at the age of 69. By 1829, the mill no longer appeared in farm accounts or inventories. By the 1850-60s, the mill, granary and homestead had fallen into disrepair. Floods and rust were an issue with the failure of the area for grain farming and it is mostly used for grazing now.<br /> The Arndell homestead is on Arndell Trail, the main and only road in Cattai NP that ends at a campground. It is a fairly modern house that looks like it was built well after 1900. The house was renovated in the 1930s by adding two wings. I looked all over the Arndell Homestead but could see no obvious evidence of a windmill other than a 4 m circle of bricks off one corner of the house.<br /> I Googled it again and it appears that the derelict windmill is on Hope Farm (the only part of the NP not open to the public). Hope Farm doesn&#8217;t show but Hope Farm Road shows on Google Maps. Dating from 1804, it is the earliest industrial site in Australia.<br /> By the time I had figured all this out, it was almost 8 and after sundown. I returned to the campground for the night. It is very odd &#8211; a huge lovely park of grass and some large trees along the Hawksbuty River. There are several lovely covered picnic tables but only for day use. The camping area is at the north end and has no tables. I drove to the very back where there was a large shelter, a double barbecue, a new stainless counter and sink (get water by pushing the blue button), and a big table with no benches and too high to sit at. Next is a gorgeous bathroom with 5-minute hot showers &#8211; I had one. Apparently the park gets a lot of use on weekends but there were only two camping here on a Sunday night. A lot of the park is fenced off as it was flooded in 2021.<br /> I counted well over 100 kangaroos along Arndell Trail and in the park.<br /> ON Cattai NP campground. $8 for a day entry to the park. I moved my table and chairs under the shelter, the lights came on and I had a great place to stay. No black flies!!! but a ton of small moths that were so irritating that I had to put on my head net. Then the small ants and two types of beetles crawled all over everything. TIA.</p><p><strong>Day 68</strong> Mon Nov 27<br /> <em>After breakfast and a leisurely start, I drove back outside the park, turned left and then down Hope Farm Road. The road has a locked gate and I walked down it alongside a power line (caved in by fallen trees) 10 minutes to the farm. There are two houses here, both unoccupied but with no evidence of a mill. I walked down a grassy trail for a long way but still did not see the mill.<br /> I Googled it again and the National Trust (Hawkesbury branch) and emailed them nt.hawkesbury@gmail .com. The windmill is closed to the public and can only be seen on tour with the National Trust in Hawkesbury. It is a 4WD trip. The last time they did a tour was in 2019. </em><em>Looking at the map, if I would have continued on a trail called the Mill Trail, I may have found it.</em><em><br /> The road I continued on. when out of the park and driving north went along the river on the opposite side of the river. From the map on the NT site, I had the location marked and went down a side road and actually got a view of the mill – a ruin with only a back wall still standing prominently on a small hill. I had a closer look with my binoculars. So even though it is an impossible NM site to see, because I spent so much time and effort trying to find it, I am going to count it, even if I didn’t get that close.</em></p><p><strong>Richmond Vale Railway Museum,</strong> Richmond Vale. Open only on the first, second and third Sundays of each month at 09:30. It was closed and I waster a 50 km return drive to get here.<br /> <strong>NEWCASTLE</strong><br /> <strong>Fort Scratchley.</strong> Built on a hill at the base of Macquarie Pier, it has a moat, guardrooms, cottages, a tunnel, batteries, cannon and a moat. Free<br /> <strong>Nobbys Lighthouse.</strong> Originally an island called Whibaygan, then Coal Island, its top was reduced from 62 m high to 28 m for stone to construct Macquaries Pier between 1818-1846 creating a breakwater for Newcastle Harbour and that connected the island to the mainland. The name was changed to Nobbys and the light was built in 1857. Walk along the pier between sand dunes and a surf beach (which appeared only after the breakwater was built) to a path that goes up the hill to the LH &#8211; closed except on Saturdays, Sundays and on cruise ship days.<br /> The port was dredged from 5.6 m deep to 17 m to allow larger ships to enter. It handles 2200 ships a year. In June 1942, a Japanese submarine lobbed 24 shells at the harbour.<br /> <strong>Newcastle Museum.</strong> In an old series of brick warehouses, the two exhibits are on transportation (with a locomotive and model ships) and BHP, the huge steel mill in Newcastle that dates to 1917. Free<br /> I grocery-shopped, bought more butane and got cheap gas at $1.80.<br /> ON Wayside 60 km south of Newcastle. No camping sign.</p><p><strong>Day 69</strong> Wed Nov 29<br /> <strong>PORT MACQUARIE<br /> </strong>I recharged my phone for the last time at the Telstra shop in PM.<br /> <strong>Mid-Central Maritime Museum.</strong> In the original 1862 Pilot Station house, this is a small museum with mostly ship models, photographs and some marine artifacts. Several anchors outside. $5<br /> <strong>Port Macquarie Historical Museum.</strong> Interesting Aboriginal photographs (cutting a shield out of a tree) but it is amazing how primitive all their ethnographic material is – truly Stone Age. Large exhibit on convicts originally bought here in 1821 and who constructed much of the old town shown on several maps and drawings. A quaint large collection of old stuff from dresses (a whole chest of them), printing, dentistry, toys, clocks, the sugar industry (lasted only until the 1830s as the climate was not inducive), marine, a drawing room. Lachlan Macquarie was the first governor of NSW from 1810-21 and there are a lot of things named after him. $5</p><p><strong>MacLeay Valley Bridge. </strong>A very long elevated four-lane bridge over the Macleay River floodplain – most in pasture and fields with the river at the north end.<strong><br /> Smoky Cape Light House.</strong> Called Smoky Cape by Cook in 1771 as the Aboriginals had lit fires. The 1891 Lighthouse is a lovely octagon with a black balcony and the original Fresnel lens. It is the highest LH in NSW at 128 m above the ocean. The views in both directions are grand – a huge sweeping beach to the south and a small beach and headlands to the north. There are three cottages below for rent. In Hat Head NP. Tours are available on the second Saturday of each month, but only for family groups, $50 per person is offered every 30-45 minutes during the day.<br /> There is a difficult 10 km trail to the Trial Bay Gaol.<br /> <strong>South West Rocks.</strong> A small town with a shopping mall and one gas station.</p><p><strong>COFFS HARBOUR</strong><br /> <strong>Butterfly House.</strong> I didn’t go as it was expensive $25, reduced 22.<br /> <strong>National Cartoon Gallery @ the Bunker.</strong> In a WWII bunker used as a communication centre. A fun museum with a wide range of cartoons mostly Australian but also from all over the world. I had a few chuckles especially at the ones about AI and the many on Donald Trump. $10, reduced $8.<br /> <strong>North Coast Regional Botanical Gardens.</strong> I really liked this garden with its mixture of natural forest and individual gardens – Rainforest, Threatened, Japanese, Mangrove, North American, succulents. The beds had a lot of densely packed bushes and flowers (a nice hydrangea garden). I walked all over the entire place. Free.<br /> <strong>Seely Lookout Forest Sky Pier.</strong> A six km drive up into the hills west of town, this is a large deck built out over the cliff and suspended by a cable suspension system. There are 270-degree views of Coffs Harbour. There are a lot of nice covered picnic tables and an 800 m loop trail that goes along the ridge.<br /> It was then a long backtracking drive of about 35 km to start my drive into the interior of New South Wales. Gas $1.83.5</p><p><strong>Ballinger</strong>. A small town with several parks and some old buildings. The road traveled on is called the Waterfall Road.<br /> ON Roses Reserve Campground. With about 9 vehicles already camping here, I was surprised that the one covered table was still open. No data connection so I started a new book.</p><p><strong>Day 70</strong> Thur Nov 30<br /> <strong>Dorrigo NP.</strong> Climb up. a long road through a mature eucalyptus forest. Many construction delays and two nice waysides with covered tables. I went to the NP Rainforest Centre, about a 2 km drive off the highway.<br /> Once over the pass, the area is a huge rolling plateau of pasture and some trees &#8211; elevation of about 800 m.<br /> <strong>Dorrigo Railway Station.</strong> There is no evidence of a station but this was obviously a dumping ground for an enormous amount of railway material &#8211; several locomotives including 13 in a row, many passenger trains, ore cars, flat decks, rails and miscellaneous machinery.<br /> <strong>Dangar Waterfall.</strong> Only about 1.2 km west of Dorrigo, it is a 30-m high cascade waterfall on the Bielsdown River. For a short time after rain, they are quite spectacular. It is a lovely wide waterfall dropping off into a large pool. The falls are a result of a lava flow from Mt Ebor that rose 600 m over its 1 million year existence. There is a great parking area and picnic site here. It is possible to climb down the banks and walk along the river below the water falls.<br /> <sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"></sup>In the past, the waterhole has been the scene of several tragic accidents due to jumping.</p><p><noscript><img decoding="async" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Dangar_Falls_Dorrigo-retouched-by-karstn.jpg" alt="Dangar_Falls_Dorrigo-retouched-by-karstn.jpg (3238×2168)" /></noscript><img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Dangar_Falls_Dorrigo-retouched-by-karstn.jpg" alt="Dangar_Falls_Dorrigo-retouched-by-karstn.jpg (3238×2168)" /><br /> <sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"></sup></p><p><strong>NSW CENTRAL &amp; WEST</strong><br /> <strong>Guy Fawkes River NP</strong><br /> <strong>Ebor Falls.</strong> The Guy Fawkes River falls 100m over two waterfalls with three lookout platforms along the edge of the gorge.

In southeast Queensland are Lamington National Park, Mount Chinghee National Park, Springbrook National Park, Mount Barney National Park and Main Range National Park. In northeast New South Wales are Barrington Tops National Park, Dorrigo National Park, Mount Warning National Park, New England National Park, Oxley Wild Rivers National Park, Washpool National Park, Willi Willi National Park and Werrikimbe National Park.<br /> When Australia separated from Antarctica following the breakup of Gondwana, new asymmetrical continental margins parallel to the coastline eroded resulting in the Great Divide and the Great Escarpment. Volcanoes erupted in sequence along the east coast during the Cenozoic Era as the Australian continental plate moved over one of the planet’s hot spots resulting in the Tweed, Focal Peak, Ebor, and Barrington volcanic shields. Ongoing geological and biological processes produced marked biological diversity with ancient origins in Gondwana, many only found here.<br /> The Tweed Shield erosion caldera is possibly the best-preserved erosion caldera in the world, notable for its size and age, has a prominent central mountain mass (Wollumbin/Mt Warning), and shows all three stages in the erosion of the caldera floor to basement rock.<br /> Further south, the remnants of the Ebor Volcano also show ongoing erosion of a shield volcano.<br /> Included are the oldest of the world’s ferns from the Carboniferous Period, Conifers from the Jurassic Period (Araucarians are the most ancient and phylogenetically primitive of the world’s conifers). Angiosperms include primitive flowering plants originating in the Early Cretaceous, the primary radiation of dicotyledons in the mid-Late Cretaceous, rainforests from the ‘golden age’ of the Early Tertiary, and Miocene vegetation, the antecedent of modern temperate rainforests in Australia.<br /> Many songbirds: lyrebirds, scrub-birds, treecreeper, bowerbirds, and catbirds (some of the oldest lineages of passerines that evolved in the Late Cretaceous).<br /> Plants and animals show relatively recent evolution. The rainforests provide a series of distinctive habitats showing an endpoint in climatic and geomorphological evolution. The distances between these ‘islands’ of rainforests represent barriers to the flow of genetic material for those taxa that have low dispersal ability. This pressure has created the potential for continued speciation. More than 270 threatened species as well as relict and primitive taxa.<br /> Rainforests covered most of Australia for much of the 40 million years after its separation from Gondwana. These contracted as climate changed and the continent drifted northwards. By European arrival, rainforests covered only 1% with suitable climatic and protection from fire. Clearing for agriculture has resulted in only a quarter of the original remaining.<br /> Protected are the largest and best stands of rainforest habitat, rare and threatened flora and fauna species that are rainforest specialists, a diverse range of heaths, rocky outcrop communities, forests, and woodlands. A high diversity of plants and animals in a habitat for rare threatened, and endemic species. Recently found and thought to be extinct: the Hastings River Mouse and Parma Wallaby.<br /> The Gondwana Rainforests contains the largest and most significant remaining stands of subtropical rainforest and Antarctic Beech in cool temperate rainforests in the world, the largest warm temperate rainforest, and one of only two remaining large areas of Araucarian rainforest in Australia.<br /> Small size and reasonable proximity with connecting corridors of semi-natural habitats and buffers make intensive management possible.<br /> <strong>My Experience.</strong> In my drive through NSW Western and Central, I went through several National Parks included in this serial listing: Dorrigo NP, , Guy Fawkes River NPOxley Wild Rivers NP, Giltralter NP and Wishpool NP.

This trail is permanently closed to visitors out of respect to the original Aboriginal custodians. The summit of Wollumbin is a sacred place to the Bundjalung People, and was declared an Aboriginal Place in 2014. Wollumbin, which means ‘cloud catcher’ to some Aboriginal People, is a traditional place of cultural law, initiation and spiritual education for the people of the Bundjalung Nation. Under Bundjalung law, only certain people can climb the summit.<br /> The Aboriginal group and NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service have come to an understanding to have the area closed off for good. Wollumbin is interconnected to a broader cultural and spiritual landscape that includes creation, dreaming stories and men&#8217;s initiation sites of deep antiquity,&#8217; it said.<br /> The trail in the national park leads to a breathtaking extinct volcano and welcomes hikers from across the country and around the world.</p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 16px;"> GO TO </span>QUEENSLAND<br /> </strong></p><div class="printfriendly pf-button pf-button-content pf-alignleft"> <a href="index.html#" rel="nofollow" onclick="window.print(); return false;" title="Printer Friendly, PDF & Email"> <noscript><img decoding="async" class="pf-button-img" src="https://cdn.printfriendly.com/buttons/printfriendly-pdf-email-button-md.png" alt="Print Friendly, PDF & Email" style="width: 194px;height: 30px;"  /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload pf-button-img" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://cdn.printfriendly.com/buttons/printfriendly-pdf-email-button-md.png" alt="Print Friendly, PDF & Email" style="width: 194px;height: 30px;"  /> </a></div></div></div><div id="entry-author-info"><div id="author-avatar"></div><div id="author-description"><h2> About admin</h2> I would like to think of myself as a full time traveler. I have been retired since 2006 and in that time have traveled every winter for four to seven months. The months that I am "home", are often also spent on the road, hiking or kayaking. 
I hope to present a website that describes my travel along with my hiking and sea kayaking experiences.<div id="author-link"> <a href="../../../../author/admin/index.html" rel="author"> View all posts by admin <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span> </a></div></div></div><div class="entry-utility"> This entry was posted in <a href="../../../../category/uncategorized/index.html" rel="category tag">Uncategorized</a>.
