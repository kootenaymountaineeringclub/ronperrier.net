The southern part of the country includes a substantial portion of Lake Victoria, shared with Kenya and Tanzania. Uganda is in the African Great Lakes region, lies within the Nile basin, and has a varied but generally modified equatorial climate. It has a population of around 49.6 million, of which 8.5 million live in the capital and largest city of Kampala.<br /> Uganda is named after the Buganda kingdom, which encompasses a large portion of the south of the country, including the capital Kampala and whose language Luganda is widely spoken throughout the country. From 1894, the area was ruled as a protectorate by the United Kingdom, which established administrative law across the territory. Uganda gained independence from the UK on 9 October 1962. The period since then has been marked by violent conflicts, including an eight-year-long military dictatorship led by Idi Amin.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><br /> </sup>The official language is English, although the Constitution states that &#8220;any other language may be used as a medium of instruction in schools or other educational institutions or for legislative, administrative, or judicial purposes as may be prescribed by law.&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-Amendment_2005_7-1" class="reference">[6]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-Republic_1-1" class="reference">[1]</sup> Luganda, a central region-based language, is widely spoken across the Central and South Eastern regions of the country, and several other languages are also spoken including Ateso, Lango, Acholi, Runyoro, Runyankole, Rukiga, Luo, Rutooro, Samia, Jopadhola, and Lusoga. In 2005 Swahili, which is foreign and so viewed as being neutral, was proposed as Uganda&#8217;s second official language, but this has yet to be ratified by parliament. In 2022 Uganda decided to make Swahili a mandatory subject in the school curriculum.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><br /> </sup>Uganda&#8217;s current president is Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, who took power in January 1986 after a protracted six-year guerrilla war.

Rent a Lexus AWD (Europcar $70/day).<br /> Tipping is not part of Ugandan culture and not expected,</p><p><strong>OBSERVATIONS UGANDA</strong><br /> <strong>1. Compared to</strong> the poverty in Burundi and Rwanda, these are the things you don&#8217;t see in Uganda: anyone walking on the road (they use bodas, minivan taxis and share taxis to get around), no firewood collecting or water hauling, no bicycle freight haulers (use motorcycles), and no impoverished filthy children. Some supermarkets look like Western grocery stores (Carrefour at Acacia Mall), restaurants where the menu reflects what they can produce, Western fast food, and ATMs that work. There is an active informal economy that sells everything on the street. Credit cards work. The roads are not as good as Rwanda where they are perfect.<br /> As I drove north, things changed some &#8211; more people walking with stuff balanced on their heads, more bicycles and the primitive tiny round/square thatched &#8220;houses&#8221;.<br /> <strong>2. Cleanliness.</strong> Not as good as Burundi and Rwanda which are perfectly clean.<br /> <strong>3. Transportation.</strong> Motor taxis (bodas) are the most efficient way around Kampala but are twice the price of Rwanda. There are a million of them. Share vans that ply fixed routes are another cheap way to get around cities. Large &#8220;cattle trucks&#8221; often are loaded with people sitting on the side benches, standing or hanging on at the back.<br /> Gas is 4600 to 5,300 per litre (at an exchange rate of 3700 and a price per litre of 5000, this equals US$1.35).<br /> <strong>4. Agriculture.</strong> Compared to Rwanda where every piece of land is planted, there is very little of that. I saw bullocks pulling a plow and men &#8220;mowing&#8221; ditches with a sickle. But there is a great selection of vegetables to buy and many roadside stands. Chickens, the occasional turkey. Cattle are big agricultural product, some of the breed with enormous horns. Tea plantations are common in the south.<br /> <strong>5. Driving.</strong> Speed limits are 50 and 80/100 and are usually marked coming into towns but not often after so it is unclear about when to drive faster. The roads are generally good and there is little traffic outside cities so this allows fast speeds &#8211; often 120-130. But private cars not uncommonly go above 140. Most of the traffic is trucks, especially petrol tankers, and share vans.<br /> There are enough motorcycles and bicycles that take up space on the road and cause vehicles to cross over the line.<br /> Uganda is speed bump crazy &#8211; most are low volume with 4 small bumps together and are best taken at speed, but there are still large bumps that must be crawled over.<br /> There are radar on overhead gantries and not infrequent police with radar guns. Police stops are common with big spike belts but I haven&#8217;t been stopped.</p><p><strong>Day 1</strong> Mon Mar 27<br /> <em>I arrived at the Trinity bus stop at 8 pm after a fatiguing 12 hours on the bus. Trinity was highly recommended but the bus had little power, the transmission was difficult to change and the driver was so non-aggressive that it was a plodding trip. With the steering on the left on a left-hand road, he depended on his &#8220;assistant&#8221; to check for incoming traffic which they often neglected doing. There was a lot of slow-moving traffic in our lane. </em><br /> <em>We had only two 5-minute stops in the entire 12 hours. I also had no Uganda money so could not buy anything even then. </em><br /> <em>At the Trinity terminal, I changed US$50 (180,000 US or 3600/1US$) so that I could get a boda or taxi to the hostel. I was hustled by an &#8220;Uber&#8221; driver and misunderstood his quote to go the 4.8km to my hostel. I thought he said 14,000 but within .5km of leaving, he informed me it was 40,000 or about US$11, a gross overpayment. I finally got out of the taxi and tried to get a boda which the taxi driver blocked wanting 10,000 for the .5km drive. I kept walking and finally lost him. A boda took me to the hostel for 10,000 UF.</em><br /> ON Acacia Villa. A dorm room in a great hostel for $10 &#8211; nice bed, plugs but no light, a good breakfast, nice staff and several travellers to talk to.

Kampala&#8217;s metropolitan area consists of the city proper and the neighbouring Wakiso District, Mukono District, Mpigi District, Buikwe District and Luweero District. It has a rapidly growing population in an area of 8,451.9 km<sup>2</sup> (3,263.3 square miles).<br /> In 2015, this metropolitan area generated an estimated nominal GDP of $13.80221 billion which was more than half of Uganda&#8217;s GDP for that year, indicating the importance of Kampala to Uganda&#8217;s economy.<br /> Kampala is reported to be among the fastest-growing cities in Africa, with an annual population growth rate of 4.03 percent. Mercer (a New York-based consulting firm) has regularly ranked Kampala as East Africa&#8217;s best city to live in, ahead of Nairobi and Kigali.<br /> <em>I had a boda-about for 2 1/2 hours to see the following. </em><br /> <strong>Independence Monument.</strong> A concrete statue with a man holding up a baby with upstretched arms.<br /> <strong>Owino Market.</strong> Another huge market &#8211; many fixed shops around the perimeter and a mass of shops under tarps and umbrellas in the centre.

This sits on top of a hill and can be seen from most places in Kampala. Two bell towers. Built in 1913-25, this large 3-nave brick church is the third biggest in Africa. There are a few frescoes, gorgeous stained glass windows, a wood tabernacle on the altar, a cross-vaulted ceiling, and a lovely wood baptismal font dating to 1884. At mass on Sundays, it is a standing room only (seats 5000) with people standing on both the lateral naves and out onto the steps. 2000UF donation.<br /> <strong>Tombs of Buganda Kings at Kasubi </strong>WHS. 30 ha of hillside on an agricultural site. On the hilltop is the former palace of the Kabakas of Buganda, built in 1882 and converted into the royal burial ground in 1884. Four royal tombs lie within the circular main building and are surmounted by a dome &#8211; principally wood, thatch, reed, wattle and daub. Each king&#8217;s body is wrapped in 350 layers of bark cloth.</p><p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="w-100 border" title="Tombs of Buganda Kings at Kasubi" src="https://whc.unesco.org/uploads/thumbs/site_1022_0003-750-750-20220502002509.jpg" width="620" height="620" /></p><p>The site is the major spiritual centre as the burial ground for the previous four kings (Kabakas). Traditional bark cloth trees, a gatehouse, the main courtyard, and culminating in the large thatched building, housing the tombs of the four Kabakas, represent the best existing example of a Baganda palace/burial site. The main tomb building, locally referred to as the &#8220;Muzibu-Azaala-Mpanga&#8221;, circular and surmounted by a dome, has been in existence since the 13<sup>th</sup> century. The latest building was the former palace of the Kabakas of Baganda, built in 1882 and converted into the royal burial ground in 1884.<br /> This central building was destroyed by fire in 2010 and is still under construction &#8211; it is surrounded by an ugly green corrugated metal fence that can be looked at over one spot in the fence.<br /> The things to see are the gate (reeds with &#8220;beams&#8221; of tied reeds (beautiful), the Royal drum house (many drums that I was allowed to play on, the graves of king&#8217;s wives, and children and several &#8220;houses&#8221; around the periphery where king&#8217;s &#8220;wives&#8221; live (Ugandan beliefs are that when a king dies, he doesn&#8217;t really die but disappears into the forest, and women (wives) live in these houses waiting for them to return). One king had 80 wives. One of the &#8220;houses&#8221; was the first in Uganda with a metal roof.<br /> I was allowed to look through tiny corrugated cinder block windows into the dark interiors all with a tomb. It was very disappointing not being able to see the big house where the 4 king&#8217;s tombs are. It looks like an amazing construction. 35,000US<strong><br /> </strong><strong>Uganda Nati</strong><strong>onal Mosque</strong> (old Gaddafi National Mosque). The National Mosque was first built by Ida Amin from 1972-79 but wasn&#8217;t finished and remained unused for 30 years. It was eventually demolished and this building was built by Gaddafi from 2002-06. It has a nice gold tiled arch at the foot of the stairs and a 50.5m tall minaret (it is possible to climb but I didn&#8217;t).

The falls are formed by the Sipi River, flowing from the upper slopes of Mount Elgon and terminate in the Kyoga Basin<br /> Sipi Falls lies at an altitude of 1,775 metres. To hike all three falls, it’ll take you roughly 3 hours. For the majority of this hike, you follow a river, making it easy to stay on track. It’ll take you through farmlands, and local communities.<br /> To see the three falls from viewpoints without the touts (guides who charge 30,000 per waterfall including a nebulous community fee) and avoid hiking, this is the way to see the three falls if coming from Mbele.<br /> See the lowest and the tallest fall at 100 metres first.

They are located 8 km west of Kumi town, The Nyero rock paintings are among the most important rock art in Uganda. These are petroglyphs (not pictographs) and are superficially pecked into the granite rock. Nyero is 11 km off the main highway on a fair packed dirt road. 15,000US + 25,000 for a camera.<br /> The rock art sites are believed to have been sacred places of the gods. The red and white paintings remain valuable to the people of Teso but are also mysterious since the painters are unknown. In the past, the Iteso people of Nyero would sacrifice and pay offerings to the gods for problems of rain, misfortune, blessings and child bearing (Nyero 3). Individual and clan prayers were held on a seasonal basis. Oral history has recorded strong attachment to sites though people were stopped from praying in the 1970s by the Government at the time. Traces of smoke from sacrifices are still visible in some of the caves. The association of a sacred prayer place in the buffer zone continues to draw nearby communities to the site.<br /> <em>History.</em> Nyero rock paintings date to before 1250 CE. Largely of geometric nature depicted in red pigment, spreading across east, central and parts of southern Africa, matching the distribution of the Late Stone Age hunter-gatherer culture. This art is generally attributed to Batwa (Twa) hunter-gatherers who are of Pygmy origin, and are today, in Eastern Africa, only found in small groups near the Rwanda/Uganda border and eastern Congo. It is likely that Twa hunter-gatherer communities once lived in the general area of these rock art sites, probably moving on due to the arrival of the present inhabitants (Nilotic, Luo, and Bantu groups).<br /> Nyero rock art site has six shelters (Nyero 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6). They are described below. I only saw site #1 and 3.<br /> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span id="Nyero_1" class="mw-headline">Nyero 1. </span></span>This is a small rock shelter with six sets of concentric circles in white, together with paintings in the shape of ‘acacia pods’.<br /> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span id="Nyero_2" class="mw-headline">Nyero 2. </span></span>This is the main shelter, a 10 m high vertical rock against the back wall and an overhang formed by the breaking away of an enormous boulder estimated to weigh at least 20,000 tons. The overhang protects the paintings from direct rain and rocks in front and to the sides protect the paintings from the sun. The paintings are all done in shades of red. Concentric circles are the dominant form with more than forty different drawings. There is one large ‘acacia pod’ design that has also been called a canoe. On the south-eastern side of the shelter, a narrow passage between the boulders leads to a small, dark shelter where there is a small cavity known as the ‘pocket’ where the early inhabitants used to offer gifts to there gods after receiving help from them.<br /> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span id="Nyero_3" class="mw-headline">Nyero 3. </span></span>This shelter is at the far northern end of the <i>Inselberg</i> and about 8 minutes walk from Nyero 2.

Once inside the artificial protecting wall, visitors have to crouch low down to reach the far end where another artificial wall makes it less dangerous and allows a wide view of the land below. The painting consists of white concentric circles; the outer circles are surrounded by double curved designs, between which are double lines divided into smaller compartments.<br /> Walk down beside the fence till it ends, join the other road and turn left at blue gate.

The Arabs, in their search for trading venues stumbled upon Ocecu Hill in present-day Gulu District. Patiko is a beauty – mountains and hills grace her extensive vegetation. And she advantageously sits near Nimule, South Sudan and onwards to eastern Egypt, where the Arabs sold their merchandise. The Arabs could not have found a better slave harbor and trade link. They descended upon Ocecu Hill and built three square-shaped huts to serve as stores for ammunition, ivory and foodstuff as well as hides and skins.<br /> Slaves were a key trading item for the Arabs too and were captured from northern Uganda, Gondokoro in Sudan and other areas. Ocecu Hill became a sorting ground for slaves. Healthy-looking ones were forced to trek from Patiko, through Sudan across the Red Sea and sold in Egypt. The journey to the slave markets was not easy. The slaves were forced to carry looted millet, simsim, ammunition and ivory. Slaves who were too weak as a result of beatings and long treks were killed by firing squad or beheaded in the designated ‘execution slab/prosecution chamber’ on the hill. Barter trade was the major form of exchange. Traditional chiefs in Patiko supplied ivory to the Arabs in exchange for sukas, beads, guns and gun powder. The Arabs turned Ocecu Hill into a trading centre and business boomed. However, when village raids intensified, fear, hunger and disease befell Patiko. Something had to be done. The then chief of Patiko – Rwot Kikwiyakare – organized the relocation of children, elders and the sick to a nearby mountain so that his people were not wiped away by the slave trade.<br /> Baker and the birth of Fort Patiko. That mountain, located about 2kms from Ocecu Hill, became known as Got Ajulu. As Britain spread its colonial wings across Africa, quashing the slave trade was one of its missions. Explorer Sir Samuel Baker was commissioned by the Queen of England to oversee that mission. In 1872, Baker returned from Egypt with Nubian soldiers, passed through Bunyoro to quash the Kabalega resistance against the British and headed to Patiko. He overran the slave harbour, expelled about 250 Arabs and fortified the place. Fort Patiko, also known as Baker’s Fort Patiko, was born.<br /> Located about 32 kilometres north of Gulu Town, the fort is enclosed by a 16-foot wide and 15-foot deep trench dug by slaves on the orders of the Arabs to avoid the escape of captives. Inside Fort Patiko lies well-trimmed grass, with a rectangular-shaped structure on the vast compound&#8217;s left. Beyond the lush compound sit three square-shaped and roofless huts that Arabs used to store their loot. One of the store walls had an inscription “Fatiko, 1872-88, founded by Sir Samuel Baker, occupied by Gordon and Emin”. Next to the three huts stand a giant rock, about 150 high and is known as Baker’s leap/seat. On top of this rock, the Arabs would sit to monitor any infiltration by their enemies to the area. Behind the three square-shaped huts is the execution slab. The ‘execution slab’ is dotted with dents which Mr Too says were caused by axes used to behead slaves.<br /> <strong>Lake Opeta,</strong> A long, out-of-the-way drive towards the NE<br /> <strong>Indigenous Peoples:</strong> Karamojongs<br /> ==============================================================</p><p><strong>Uganda – West (Mbarara, Kasese, Kabale, Fort Portal)<br /> </strong><strong>Borders: </strong>Congo Democratic Republic-Uganda<strong>, </strong>Rwanda-Uganda<strong>, </strong>Tanzania-Uganda<strong>, </strong>Uganda (lake)</p><p><em>I&#8217;m not sure why I decided to come to see Murchison Falls and the NP.

The national park is part of the larger Murchison Falls Conservation Area which includes Bugungu Wildlife Reserve and Karuma Wildlife Reserve creating over 2,072 square miles (5,366 sq km) of protected wilderness.<br /> Although the park is renowned for the stunningly powerful Murchison Falls, it is an amazing place to take a safari and witness some of Africa’s incredible wildlife.  The falls are on the Victoria or White Nile River.  The park is home to the largest population of Nile crocodiles.<br /> In addition to the large population of crocodiles, there are around 75 species of mammals. Some of the larger and more popular wildlife species include lion, leopard, giraffe, elephant, waterbuck, hartebeest, buffalo, hippopotamus, and chimpanzee. There are about 800 chimpanzees living across the national park boundaries.<br /> Murchison Falls National Park is also a haven for bird watchers with over 450 species of birds that nest or migrate through the park.  The Goliath Heron is a nice treat to see since it is the largest heron in the world.  Many of the species are waterfowl, however, there are many other species such as the red-throated bee-eater.<br /> <strong>Murchison Falls.</strong> Murchison Falls National Park is best known, though, for the most powerful waterfall in the world. Every second, the equivalent of 200 bathtubs full of water is forced through a gorge less than seven paces wide. The pressure is so great that the ground trembles around it.

Through repeated scraping, spreading and heaping of the salty soil over seven days, it is leached and the scam is built to the crystallization point to produce the ash salt. The residual soil from leaching is then mixed with fresh soil to repeat the salt production process.<br /> Salt production was and is a female hereditary occupation.

It is Africa&#8217;s seventh-largest lake, as well as the second-biggest of Uganda&#8217;s Great Lakes. It is the northernmost of the chain of lakes in the Albertine Rift, the western branch of the East African Rift.<br /> It is about 160 kilometres (99 mi) long and 30 kilometres (19 mi) wide, with a maximum depth of 51 metres (167 ft), and a surface elevation of 619 metres (2,031 ft) above sea level.<br /> Lake Albert is part of the complicated system of the Upper Nile. Its main sources are the White Nile, ultimately coming from Lake Victoria to the southeast, and the Semliki River, which is from Lake Edward to the southwest. The water of the Victoria Nile is much less saline than that of Lake Albert. The lake&#8217;s outlet, at its northernmost tip, is the Albert Nile section of the White Nile. The river later becomes known as the Mountain Nile when its course enters South Sudan.<br /> At the southern end of the lake, where the Semliki comes in are swamps. The Rwenzori Mountains are to the south of the lake and the northwest, the Blue Mountains. The few settlements along the shore include Butiaba and Pakwach.<br /> Lake Albert&#8217;s water temperature is relatively stable throughout, typically around 27–29 °C (81–84 °F), and even its deeper sections contain oxygen.<br /> <sup id="cite_ref-Green2009_2-0" class="reference"></sup>Lake Albert is home to many aquatic and semi-aquatic animals, including the river hippopotamus, Ugandan kob, and red as well as Nile lechwe, Nile crocodile, Nile monitor lizard, African softshell turtle, Central African mud turtle, and Williams&#8217; mud turtle. Also present is the giant African bullfrog and the rock python, which can be observed warming themselves on smooth rocks near the water’s edge.

Geographically, Lake Katwe is found within an explosion crater in the formerly active volcanic area northeast of Lake Edward and southeast of Lake George. The lake is found in the small run-down town of Katwe on the outskirts of the Queen Elizabeth National Park in the Kasese district and covers an area of approximately eight square miles. Its shores are lined with small ponds or pans of water from which salt is extracted from the bottom in a process called salt panning.<br /> The salt content of the lake waters is approximately 13.5 %. The lake bed is 0.8 meters thick and contains approximately over 12 million tonnes of salt, varying in composition and depth and has salt stocks estimated to sustain an industrial extraction plant with a production rate of 7 tonnes of salt per hour for 34 years. On this basis, an industry to mechanize the salt production process was put in place in the 1970s by Idi Amin Dada but the project never took off to date and the Katwe salt project is now on the brink of privatization.<br /> <strong><br /> Lake Edward </strong>is one of the smaller African Great Lakes. It is located in the Albertine Rift, the western branch of the East African Rift, on the border between the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Uganda, with its northern shore a few kilometres south of the equator.<br /> Henry Morton Stanley first saw the lake in 1888, during the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition. The lake was named in honour of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, son of then-British monarch Queen Victoria, and later to become King Edward VII.<br /> In 2014, the lake was the center of an oil dispute. SOCO International entered the premises of the Virunga National Park where the lake is situated to prospect for oil. However, villagers and workers who attempted to stop the oil company from entering the area were beaten up and even kidnapped and tortured.<br /> Lake Edward lies at an elevation of 920 metres, is 77 kilometres long by 40 kilometres wide at its maximum points, and covers a total surface area of 2,325 square kilometres, making it the 15th-largest on the continent. The lake is fed by the Nyamugasani River, the Ishasha River, the Rutshuru River, the Ntungwe River, and the Rwindi River. Lake George to the northeast empties into it via the Kazinga Channel. Lake Edward empties to the north via the Semliki River into Lake Albert.<br /> The western escarpment of the Great Rift Valley towers up to 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) above the western shore of the lake.

Absolute power. Idi Amin&#8217;s eight-year rule produced economic decline, social disintegration, and massive human rights violations.

The Tanzanian army, backed by Ugandan exiles waged a war of liberation against Amin&#8217;s troops and the Libyan soldiers sent to help him. On April 11, 1979, Kampala was captured, and Amin fled with his remaining forces. This led to the return of Obote, who was deposed once more in 1985 by General Tito Okello. Okello ruled for six months until he was deposed after the so-called &#8220;bush war&#8221; by the National Resistance Army (NRA) operating under the leadership of the current president, Yoweri Museveni, and various rebel groups, including the Federal Democratic Movement of Andrew Kayiira, and another belonging to John Nkwanga.<br /> Museveni has been in power since 1986. In the mid to late 1990s, he was lauded by the West as part of a new generation of African leaders. His presidency has been marred, however, by invading and occupying the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the Second Congo War, resulting in an estimated 5.4 million deaths since 1998, and by participating in other conflicts in the Great Lakes region of Africa. He has struggled for years in the civil war against the Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army, which has been guilty of numerous crimes against humanity, including child slavery, the Atiak massacre, and other mass murders.

By 1500 AD, they were assimilated into Bantu-speaking cultures south of Mount Elgon, the Nile River, and Lake Kyoga.<br /> Arab traders moved into the land from the Indian Ocean coast of East Africa in the 1830s for trade and commerce. Later, the British arrived in Uganda with a predisposition against the kingdom of Bunyoro and sided with the kingdom of Buganda.<br /> In the 1860s, while Arabs sought influence from the north, British explorers searching for the source of the Nile arrived in Uganda. They were followed by British Anglican missionaries who arrived in the kingdom of Buganda in 1877 and French Catholic missionaries in 1879.<br /> From 1886, there was a series of religious wars in Buganda, initially between Muslims and Christians and then, from 1890, between ba-Ingleza Protestants and ba-Fransa Catholics. Because of civil unrest and financial burdens, IBEAC claimed that it was unable to &#8220;maintain its occupation&#8221; in the region. British commercial interests were ardent to protect the trade route of the Nile, which prompted the British government to annex Buganda and adjoining territories to create the Uganda Protectorate in 1894.<sup id="cite_ref-Snakes_33-1" class="reference"><br /> </sup><span id="Uganda_Protectorate_(1894–1962)" class="mw-headline"><strong>Uganda Protectorate</strong> (1894–1962). </span>The Protectorate of Uganda was a protectorate of the British Empire from 1894 to 1962. In 1894 the territory was extended to Toro in 1900, Ankole in 1901, and Bunyoro in 1933) to an area that roughly corresponds to that of present-day Uganda.<br /> In the 1890s, 32,000 labourers from British India were recruited to East Africa under indentured labour contracts to construct the Uganda Railway. Most of the surviving Indians returned home, but 6,724 decided to remain in East Africa after the line&#8217;s completion. Subsequently, some became traders and took control of cotton ginning and sartorial retail.<br /> From 1900 to 1920, a sleeping sickness epidemic in the southern part of Uganda, along the north shores of Lake Victoria, killed more than 250,000 people.<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><br /> </sup>World War II recruited 77,143 soldiers to serve in the King&#8217;s African Rifles and fought in the Western Desert campaign, the Abyssinian campaign, the Battle of Madagascar and the Burma campaign.<br /> <span id="Independence_(1962_to_1965)" class="mw-headline"><strong>Independence</strong> (1962 to 1965).

In October 1963, Uganda became a republic but maintained its membership in the Commonwealth of Nations.<br /> The first post-independence government had Milton Obote as prime minister, with the Buganda Kabaka (King) Edward Muteesa II holding the largely ceremonial position of president.<br /> <span id="Buganda_crisis_.281962.E2.80.931966.29"></span><span id="Buganda_crisis_(1962–1966)" class="mw-headline"><strong>Buganda crisis</strong> (1962–1966). </span>From the moment the British created the Uganda protectorate, the issue of how to manage the largest monarchy within the framework of a unitary state had always been a problem. Milton Obote, of the Uganda People&#8217;s Congress (UPC) wanted to rectify what they saw as the regional inequality that favoured Buganda&#8217;s special status.<br /> In Obote&#8217;s absence from Parliament, the illegal plundering of ivory and gold from the Congo had been orchestrated by Obote&#8217;s army chief of staff, Colonel Idi Amin. Obote eventually gave Amin more power as the Army Commander position. The lines were now drawn for a showdown between Buganda and the Central government.<br /> In May 1966, the Kabaka made his move. He asked for foreign help, and the Buganda parliament demanded that the Uganda government leave Buganda (including the capital, Kampala). In response, Obote ordered Idi Amin to attack the Kabaka&#8217;s palace. The battle for the Kabaka&#8217;s palace was fierce – the Kabaka&#8217;s guards putting up more resistance than had been expected. The British-trained Captain – the Kabaka with about 120 armed men kept Idi Amin at bay for twelve hours. It is estimated that up to 2,000 people died in the battle which ended when the army called in heavier guns and overran the palace. The anticipated countryside uprising in Buganda did not materialize and a few hours later a beaming Obote met the press to relish his victory. The Kabaka escaped over the palace walls and was transported into exile in London by supporters. He died there three years later.<br /> <span id="1966.E2.80.931971_.28before_the_coup.29"></span><span id="1966–1971_(before_the_coup)" class="mw-headline"><strong>1966–1971</strong> (before the coup). </span>In 1966, following a power struggle between the Obote-led government and King Muteesa, Obote suspended the constitution and removed the ceremonial president and vice-president. In 1967, a new constitution proclaimed Uganda a republic and abolished the traditional kingdoms.

Amin ruled Uganda as dictator with the support of the military for the next eight years. He carried out mass killings within the country to maintain his rule. An estimated 80,000–500,000 Ugandans died during his regime. Aside from his brutalities, he forcibly removed the entrepreneurial Indian minority from Uganda.<br /> In June 1976, Palestinian terrorists hijacked an Air France flight and forced it to land at Entebbe airport. One hundred of the 250 passengers originally on board were held hostage until an Israeli commando raid rescued them ten days later.

Political parties in Uganda were restricted in their activities beginning that year, in a measure ostensibly designed to reduce sectarian violence.

They could not open branches, hold rallies, or field candidates directly (although electoral candidates could belong to political parties). A constitutional referendum cancelled this nineteen-year ban on multi-party politics in July 2005.<br /> In 1993, Pope John Paul II visited Uganda during his 6-day pastoral trip to urge Ugandans to seek reconciliation.

I have been retired since 2006 and in that time have traveled every winter for four to seven months. The months that I am "home", are often also spent on the road, hiking or kayaking. 
I hope to present a website that describes my travel along with my hiking and sea kayaking experiences.<div id="author-link"> <a href="../../../../author/admin/index.html" rel="author"> View all posts by admin <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span> </a></div></div></div><div class="entry-utility"> This entry was posted in <a href="../../../../category/uncategorized/index.html" rel="category tag">Uncategorized</a>.
