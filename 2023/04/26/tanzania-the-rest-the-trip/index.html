People.</strong> Like most everywhere, Tanzanians are extremely nice and all too ready to help with advice or directions. English can be sporadic and many speak little or none. I downloaded Swahili on Google Translate and found it very useful.<br /> It appears that the most common employment for young Tanzanian men is as boda drivers &#8211; they are everywhere. Many are not educated and speak little or no English but some are educated people who cannot find jobs.<br /> Another significant employer is as &#8220;grass cutters&#8221; on roadside ditches. Cows and sheep often browse in the ditches in other countries but not here. It is common to see large gangs of men with machetes cutting the grass, a very labour-intensive job.<br /> <strong>2. Driving.</strong> Tanzania has generally excellent roads (except in Ngorongoro and Serengeti) with few potholes. The only posted speed limits are the 50km/hr signs on either side of most any house on the side of the road, so there are a lot of speed zones. The upper speed is never posted, but I am assuming it&#8217;s 100km/hr. Police are only in the towns and are common, pulling over as many people as possible in search of bribes. Because every town has speed bumps, and the speed is strictly enforced, the only reasonable way to drive is to stick as close to 50 as possible. Certainly, the locals do. It is important to not give them any excuse to pull you over.<br /> On the drive from Songea to the coast, there were many towns, most a long row of houses along the road. Many didn&#8217;t have speed bumps and there were no police.<br /> These police don&#8217;t often have radar. In some places, radar is on thin white poles with solar panels.<br /> Outside of cities, there is little traffic. Big trucks, the Toyota Cruiser buses, share taxis, motorcycles, bicycles, pedestrians, and tuk-tuks can make for slow driving. Driving at night is discouraged as there are many pedestrians and motorcycles with no lights. Stopped vehicles often put rocks in the lane they are obstructing.<br /> <strong>3. Police.</strong> Tanzania is notorious for police corruption and bribery. Surprisingly, after 8 days of driving, I have only been pulled over four times and have yet to get a ticket. Whining helps but they are very persistent. The one thing that works best is to say that you have no cash and pay for everything with a credit card.</p><p><strong>TANZANIA &#8211; NORTHEASTERN (Arusha, Kilimanjaro, Manyara, Tanga)<br /> </strong><strong>Borders: </strong>Kenya-Tanzania<strong>, </strong>Tanzania mainland (sea border/port/lake)<br /> <strong>TANGA<br /> <em>Airports: </em></strong>Tanga (TGT)<br /> History, Culture, National and City Museums: Tanga: Urithi Tanga Museum</p><p><strong>Day 6</strong> Thur Apr 27<br /> I was up very early, showered, had a good breakfast, and was off by 6 am, hoping to get to Arusha by nightfall.</p><p><strong>TANZANIA – NORTHEASTERN (Arusha, Kilimanjaro, Manyara, Tanga)<br /> </strong><strong>Borders: </strong>Kenya-Tanzania<strong>, </strong>Tanzania mainland (sea border/port/lake)<br /> <strong>West Usambaras Lushoto Mountain Reserve.</strong> In northeastern Tanzania, these are the easternmost ranges of the Eastern Arc Mountains that stretch from Kenya through Tanzania. The ranges are 90 kilometres long and 30-50 km wide. They were formed nearly two million years ago by faulting and uplifting, and are composed of Precambrian metamorphic rocks. They are split into two sub-ranges; the West Usambaras being higher (Chambolo peak 2,289 m) than the East Usambaras, which are nearer the coast and receive more rainfall. The mountain range was formed nearly two million years ago. Due to a lack of glaciations and a relatively consistent climate, the rainforest has gone through a long-term and unique evolution resulting in an impressive amount of endemism and old-growth cloud rainforests.<br /> Historically they were inhabited by Bantu, Shambaa, and Maasai people but in the eighteenth century, a Shambaa kingdom was founded by Mbegha. German colonists settled in the area which was to become German East Africa, and after World War I it became part of the British-mandated territory of Tanganyika.<br /> The range is accessible from the towns of Lushoto in the west, and Amani in the east.<br /> The Usambara Mountains are fairly unusual in East Africa with their natural regions still covered in tropical forests, which otherwise continentally remain primarily in Western Africa. Considered tremendously significant ecologically and a Biodiversity hotspot Several species are endemic to the Usambara forests, including the Usambara eagle-owl, the Usambara akalat, the Usambara weaver, the African violet, the tree species <i>Calodendrum eickii</i>.<br /> Today, the population of the Usambara Mountains region has one of the highest growth rates, a staggering amount of poverty, and highest densities of people in all of Tanzania. Most of the inhabitants are subsistence farmers who rely heavily on the forests around them for timber, medicinal plants, clearing for agriculture, and fuelwood. 70% of the original forest cover of the West and East Usambaras has been lost by foreign-controlled logging companies<br /> <strong>Mkomazi NP. </strong>In northeastern Tanzania on the Kenyan border, it covers over 3,234 square kilometres and is dominated by <i>Acacia</i>–<i>Commiphora</i> vegetation; it is contiguous with Kenya’s Tsavo West National Park.<br /> When Mkomazi was first established a number of pastoral families from the Parakuyo ethnic group were allowed to continue to live there with a few thousand of their cattle, goats and sheep. Immigrant Maasai pastoralists and families from other ethnic groups were evicted when the reserve was established. Mkomazi’s history was dominated by rising cattle populations – in the 1980s around 80,000 cattle were counted inside the reserve.<br /> For many conservationists, Mkomazi is a celebrated success story as it has been restored to good health. African wild dogs, and the extensive, patrolled sanctuary for the black rhinoceros (which are breeding) have put the reserve on the map. Fauna include the Black rhinoceros, Lion, Common eland, Hartebeest, Grant’s Zebra, African Elephant and the Spotted hyena<br /> <strong>Chagga Museum</strong>, Marangu. Offer a coffee tour plus a tour of their famous tunnels used to hide from enemies. Only two of the 60+ rooms are open. 12,000TS</p><p><strong>KILIMANJARO NATIONAL PARK </strong>WHS. The mountain is encircled by mountain forest. Numerous mammals, many of them endangered species, live in the park.<img decoding="async" class="w-100 border ls-is-cached lazyloaded" title="Kilimanjaro National Park" src="https://whc.unesco.org/uploads/thumbs/site_0403_0001-750-750-20151105162509.jpg" data-src="https://whc.unesco.org/uploads/thumbs/site_0403_0001-750-750-20151105162509.jpg" />Kilimanjaro National Park covering an area of some 75,575 ha protects the largest free standing volcanic mass in the world and the highest mountain in Africa, rising 4877m above surrounding plains to 5895m at its peak. With its snow-capped peak, the Kilimanjaro is a superlative natural phenomenon, standing in isolation above the surrounding plains overlooking the savannah.<br /> It has three main volcanic peaks, Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. The mountain has five main vegetation zones from the lowest to the highest point:  Lower slopes, montane forest, heath and moorland, alpine desert and summit. The whole mountain including the montane forest belt is very rich in species, in particular mammals, many of them endangered species.  For this combination of features but mostly its height, its physical form and snow cap and its isolation above the surrounding plains, Mount Kilimanjaro is considered an outstanding example of a superlative natural phenomenon.<br /> The park is connected to Amboseli National Park, however corridors to Arusha National Park and Tsavo National park have been encroached, impacting on wildlife migration.<br /> <b>Marangu gate</b> is the Park Headquarters 86 km from Kilimanjaro International Airport. The other seven gates – Rongai, Machame, Londorosi, Lemosho, Kilema, Mweka and Umbwe are located around the mountain base and can be reached by road.</p><div class="border-top pt-4 mt-4"><p><em>I did one of my dumbest things. I looked up the gates and instead of putting in the gates,  I read that Marangu Gate is 41 km from Moshi Town so drove to Moshi only to learn that the turnoff to Marangu Gate was where I was. Once in Moshi, I saw that the closest gate was Mweka, a 25km drive, closer than Marangu. Google Maps then took me on the wrong route over a very rough washed-out road through a coffee plantation until I finally hit the good paved road that leads directly up from Moshi!!! When I got to Mweke, the gate was closed.</em></p><p>ON The Eco Tourism Centre. 100 m from the gate, this was the only flat space around. I slept there instead of going all the way back to Moshi. It turned out to be incredibly good with a covered area of tables that I sat under out of the rain for dinner and breakfast. My mat fits perfectly diagonally in the Harier and I had a very comfortable nite sleeping for 10 hours.</p><p><strong>Day 6</strong> Fri Apr 28<br /> <em>I entered the Mwerka Gate and talked to the guy in the beautiful visitor’s centre. It was raining hard and after a short walk in the woods, I basically turned back, drove through Moshi, and continued on my day (a very brief visit to the park). </em></p><p><strong>Kikuletwas Hot Springs.</strong> I didn&#8217;t go here but include it as an option outside Moshi. The turnoff is just before the turnoff to Oldonyou Murwak and then a 1 1/2 hour drive from Moshi on a rough and dusty road via Cheamka village. It is an oasis with scenic, warm, blue, clear water and Garra Rufa Fish that are used for pedicures around the world. They work by sucking and nibbling on your skin, tenderly removing dead skin cells through natural exfoliation. The spring is quite deep in the middle, and the current is quite strong when you try to swim to the other side</p><div id="wrap_all"><div id="main" class="all_colors" data-scroll-offset="116"><div class="container_wrap container_wrap_first main_color sidebar_right"><div class="container template-blog template-single-blog "><p><strong>Oldonyo Murwak</strong> (27/05/1997). This property is a hill connected to a corridor within the Sanya Plains to the Plains to the North of Kilimanjaro International Airport, in Hai District, on the Moshi-Arusha Road. The property is a religious–ritual site for the Maasai-speaking people of Kenya and Tanzania. It is on his hill that once every twelve to fourteen years all Maasai age sets receive their name and through the ritual change into elders within the society. <em>Coordinates: </em>Lat. 3°22′ South Long. 37°03′ East.<br /> Access this for the last 3 km on a very rough road through fields. On arrival, it is not sure exactly what and where the site is, but I assume the highest hill around. I drove farther on the road than Google Maps suggested and came to a high point next to the hill.</p></div></div></div></div><p><strong>ARUSHA </strong>(pop 2,356,255 2022). <sup id="cite_ref-2012_census_2-0" class="reference"></sup>Located below Mount Meru on the eastern edge of the eastern branch of the Great Rift Valley, Arusha City has a temperate climate. The city is close to the Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Lake Manyara National Park, Olduvai Gorge, Tarangire National Park, Mount Kilimanjaro, and Mount Meru in the Arusha National Park.<br /> The city is a major international diplomatic hub. It is the capital of the East African Community. From 1994 to 2015, the city also hosted the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, It is a multicultural city with a majority Tanzanian population of mixed backgrounds: indigenous African, Arab-Tanzanian, and Indian-Tanzanian population, plus a small European and North American minority population. Religions of the Arusha city population include Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, and Hinduism.<br /> The current site of Arusha was first settled in the 1830s by the agro-pastoral Arusha Maasai from the Arusha Chini community, south of Mount Kilimanjaro. They traded grains, honey, beer, and tobacco with the pastoral Kisongo Maasai in exchange for livestock, milk, meat, and skins.<br /> Arusha was conquered by the Germans in 1896 after the murder of the first two missionaries who attempted to settle on nearby Mount Meru. The Germans established a permanent presence in 1900 when a military fort (a <i>boma</i>) was built. Many Africans were forcibly displaced from their ancestral lands by the Germans and forced to dig lime or carry stones to construct the fort. The British took Arusha from the Germans in 1916 during World War I. The Great Depression soon squelched commerce and Arusha in 1940 had fewer than 2,000 residents.<br /> Arusha has been a crucial city in the history of modern Tanzania. Official documents ceding independence to Tanganyika were signed by the United Kingdom at Arusha in 1961.<br /> <strong>Warning: </strong>Arusha has a hard-to-understand parking rule. Even though the rule is not advertised in any way, I was clamped and given a 63,000 TS parking fine outside the Central Market. I could not find out how I was to know this (very uncommon in the rest of Africa and maybe the world) but the guys gave no information even though I tried my best to use Google Translate into Swahili. I was clearly at their mercy with the clamp on my wheels. I contacted Arusha City about this but don&#8217;t expect a reply.<br /> Basically, this is a big messy African city with clogged traffic, difficult parking and not much to see. I was here to get my permit for Nogongoro Park. Avoid it at all costs &#8211; it can be an expensive city to visit.<br /> <strong>Natural History Museum.</strong> A lot of history of the Olduvai Gorge and human evolution, geology, and stuffed animals. 12000 TS<br /> <strong>Arusha Declaration Monument</strong>. In the middle of a roundabout, this very high monument has a torch on a column sitting on four large tripod legs.<br /> <strong>Arusha Central Market.</strong> A large market with one of the largest selections of produce (mostly vegetables and fruit) I have ever seen. A few other shops including kitchenware and cloth in the east-facing side. As above, I was clamped and fined 63,000TS when parked on the road beside the market.<br /> <strong>Arusha Coffee Lodge.</strong> Eco-Experience: A lovely facility about 4 km west of the city. It has a bar, bistro, a shop displaying glass, and a wonderful workshop for disabled people blowing glass (which was very cheap to buy) and making jewelry and wind chimes. there is also the ubiquitous coffee tour &#8211; work, watch coffee roasting, and have a coffee &#8211; one hour for an expensive US$35. I had a good coffee.<br /> <strong>Meserani Snake Park.</strong> About 24 km east of Arusha, it has all the African snakes but a whopping $20 entry fee.</p><p><em>The countryside west of Arusha is flat, verdant green pasture land with initially only a few trees. There are frequent herds of cattle and goats with Masaai &#8221; shepherds. Go over a low rise of hills and the flat plateau continues but with many more trees and bush.</em><br /> <em>On my way to the hostel, I stopped at a small store to buy milk. The owner of the shop was Chief Baraka, the elected chief of over 5,000 Masaai with 47 &#8220;counselors&#8221; who meet regularly with his people and report back to him. He has 7 wives, 25 children, and 100 cattle. Each wife has their own house and the children stay in another wife&#8217;s house when he visits her for the night. His traditional dress is three pieces &#8211; a &#8220;skirt&#8221; tied over the shoulders, an inner piece of a different colour, and an outside large piece using a shawl. All are tartans or small checks. Red is a common colour especially for the children actively herding cattle as red scares away lions. Blue is worn for luck. All Masaai men carry a mid-sized knife, very sharp on both sides used to carve meat, carve the traditional walking staff, and fend off animals.</em><br /> <em>All men have had their two middle lower incisors removed, and many have pierced ears with large holes in their lobes. They drink milk daily, eat meat a few times a week, and drink blood (often mixed with milk) on special occasions.</em><br /> <em>He owns a Masaai cultural tour company and invited me to spend a few hours or overnight in his village. I will be passing it on my way back and may take him up on his offer.</em></p><p>ON Ava Garden Hostel in Mto wa Bbu, about 16 km east of Karatu, the closest town to the entrance to Ngorongoro Conservation Area. US$16 for a dorm room. It is a lovely hostel. I am alone in a large 4-bed dorm with large double beds. There is a great outside covered eating area with a kettle and toaster.</p><p><strong>Day 7</strong> Sat Apr 29<br /> <em>I was up at 4:45, had a quick shower and breakfast, and was off driving via Karatu towards the Loduare Gate entrance to Ngorongoro. I paid for my permit at the gate by credit card. US$106.20 + 23,600 TS. I didn&#8217;t go down into the crater $295/vehicle. To put this into perspective, a US National Park pass for one year allowing unlimited entries to all national parks in the US is $85 (about the same for Canada). The one-day pass to go into the crater is $422.20 X 365 = 154,103 ÷ 85 = 1,813 times or 181,300 % more expensive. Tanzania has priced itself out of the national park business. </em><br /> <em>Immediately after entering the gate, the road turns into hard-packed dirt, rounded to allow water drainage (for this price, they don&#8217;t even provide pavement!!). Within a few km is the first viewpoint, and because of the cloud, I could not see 50m ahead of me. Hopefully, the cloud will clear by the time I will be driving back. I passed two large trucks in those first few km, I suppose taking freight to Serengeti. </em><br /> <em>The road down into the crater and the east rim of the park takes off to the right. It was about 52km to Oldavai from the viewpoint.<br /> I saw 4 female waterbuck (large, brown with white tail patch), and 3 cape buffalo. Pass several lodges (Rhino Lodge, Ngorongoro Crater Lodge, ), public campsites (Simba A), several special campsites (Simba B), a policeman, several &#8220;workers&#8221;, many Maasai, many Land Cruisers, vans, all in a total white out. The jungle changed into grassland.<br /> I stopped briefly, but then could not start the car &#8211; there was no battery power and I assumed that there was a loose battery terminal. Then I discovered that there was no hood latch!!!!! A Maasai guy pulled back the plastic cover, reached in, and found a small lever to open the hood. The left terminal was very loose and I stopped a lodge land cruiser &#8211; the terminal was already tight but he cut a piece of copper wire and wedged it into the terminal &#8211; and the car started.<br /> At the second viewpoint, the cloud was mostly clear and there were reasonable views down into the crater with its big lake.<br /> I gave the Maasai guy a ride to his village (there are 56 Maasai villages in the park). At his village, I asked to see it and we walked down. We were met by 5 guys, one his brother and also obviously the son of the chief. The chief has 12 wives and there are 46 brothers. The other brother would not let me enter unless I paid $20. There are two round stockades of rough poles, one for cattle and the other for houses &#8211; round mud/wattle walls and roofs on the perimeter of the stockade. Inside was a big clear area with a large circle of stands holding jewelry for sale. An older woman was adding mud to the walls. The area around the village was big and open grassland, all very verdant and green.<br /> On the descent down from the crater, I saw 13 giraffes and 4 zebra. After it flattened out, there was a herd of wildebeest with 5 zebras,<br /> Land Rovers serve as transport for the locals and are always blasting by on the dusty roads. The roads are rough washboard with occasional areas of potholes and water channels.<br /> The Maasai always offer village tours with dancing. One was $50 (the mzunga price) $25 for Tanzanians! </em></p><div class="thumb tleft"><div class="thumbinner"><strong style="font-size: 16px;">NGORONGORO CONSERVATION AREA. </strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">The Ngorongoro Conservation Area spans vast expanses of highland plains, savanna, savanna woodlands and forests from the plains of the Serengeti National Park in the north-west, to the eastern arm of the Great Rift Valley. Established in 1959 as a multiple land use area, with wildlife coexisting with semi-nomadic Maasai pastoralists practicing traditional livestock grazing, it includes the spectacular Ngorongoro Crater, the world’s largest caldera, and Olduvai Gorge, a 14km long deep ravine (although the interpretation of many of the assemblages of Olduvai Gorge is still debatable, their extent and density are remarkable. Several of the type fossils in the hominin lineage come from this site).<br /> </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">The property has global importance for biodiversity conservation due to the presence of globally threatened species, such as the black Rhino, the density of wildlife inhabiting the area, and the annual migration of wildebeest, zebra, Thompson’s and Grant’s gazelles and other animals into the northern plains. Extensive archaeological research has also yielded a long sequence of evidence of human evolution and human-environment dynamics, including early hominid footprints dating back 3.6 million years.<br /> </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">The Ngorongoro Crater was named by the Maasai people, the original inhabitants, to mean </span><em style="font-size: 16px;">the gift of life – </em><span style="font-size: 16px;">lush and green, with jungles along the crater rim and green grasses in an otherwise savannah-like Rift Valley. The crater is the world’s largest inactive, intact, and unfilled volcanic caldera, and was named one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Africa.<br /> </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">Approximately 25,000 animals live in the crater, and it is one of the best places in Tanzania to see the critically endangered black rhino and one of the the densest known population of Masai lions.<br /> </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">You can see it in a day. The crater is pretty small at 8,292 km</span><sup>2</sup><span style="font-size: 16px;"> (3,202 sq mi), and there aren’t a lot of places to hide, so the animals are everywhere, in plain sight. In almost any direction you look, you’ll see zebra, wildebeest, elephants, lions, and rhinos.<br /> </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">If you have the money, stay on the rim at one of the lodges to see the sunset. Then leave as early as possible to drive into the Ngorongoro Crater. Later in the day, the animals get lazy and tired and try to hide from the heat, many cars arrive so the crater gets crowded, and the light gets quite harsh for photos. Guides have radios to communicate with other guides to find the best places to see animals. If you self-drive, there is a $300 vehicle fee plus the $70 per person park fee. The safari tracks on the crater floor are well-maintained and signposted, and it&#8217;s basically impossible to get lost. There are designated picnic areas to eat.<br /> </span><strong style="font-size: 16px;">Driving times</strong><span style="font-size: 16px;"> to the Ngorongoro are as follows: Arusha – Loduare Gate (NCA entrance); crater rim: 3-4 hours; Loduare Gate to Ngorongoro Crater entrance: 1.5 hours; Ngorongoro Crater entrance to Naabi Hill Gate (Serengeti entrance): 3-4 hours.<br /> </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">Note that it’s about a 3-4 hour drive from the NCA Simba Public Campsite to Naabi Gate Serengeti (which is also the exit of the NCA). So if you want to avoid paying the NCA twice, whilst staying overnight in the NCA, you have to time your visit wisely and take the 3-4 hour drive into account to exit the NCA.<br /> </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">Ngorongoro Crater is about 185 km from Arusha by road. There are daily flights from Arusha to Lake Manyara Airstrip and then a scenic one-and-a-half-hour trip to the Ngorongoro Crater. The gates into the Ngorongoro Conservation Area open at 6:00 a.m. and close at 7:00 p.m., but movement is allowed after dark between the campsites and the lodges.<br /> </span><strong style="font-size: 16px;">Entrance fees.</strong><span style="font-size: 16px;"> </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">The entrance permits for the Ngorongoro Conservation Area and Crater can’t be arranged and paid for on arrival at the park gate. You must get the NCA reservation permit, and the actual permit needs to be paid for in cash at the bank or by credit card at the entrance to the park.<br /> </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">Go to the Ngorongoro Tourism Centre in Arusha. The Ngorongoro Conversation Area Authority Office is on the ground floor. Entrance for a non-resident is $70.80 per person. The vehicle entry fee for a locally registered vehicle is 23,600 TS ($10) per day for a RAV4 (less than 2000 kg which my vehicle is) and 41,300 TSH ($20) per day for a Landcruiser. To enter the crater, you have to pay the additional Crater Service Fee of $295 per vehicle (not per person – that is my problem – I am alone) each time you go down the crater. Public campsites are $35 per person/night. Special campsites are $50 per person/night.<br /> </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">Another possibility is to enter the park, drive around the rim (but not enter the crater itself), go to Olduvai Gorge (see the museum), see the great wildebeest migration and return on the same day and exit the park. Because I did not want to pay the US$295 fee to enter the park, this is what I did.<br /> </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">A Ngorongoro Crater tour is usually combined with a safari in neighboring Serengeti National Park. The distance by road from Serengeti to Ngorongoro is just under an hour and a half.<br /> </span><strong style="font-size: 16px;">Accommodation.</strong><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"> Karatu is a nice and affordable place to base yourself from when visiting the NCA and the Ngorongoro Crater. If you want to stay inside the NCA, the most affordable option is Simba Public Campsite A, on the crater rim. The rest of the campsites on the crater rim are so-called ‘special campsites, largely reserved by private safari companies, who bid on them for the season. As an individual traveller, you won’t be able to stay there. The less interesting special campsites are not taken by the safari companies and are available for booking by individual travelers. The most affordable lodge on the crater rim is Rhino Lodge – it doesn’t have a view though. All the other lodges are very expensive.<br /> I entered the park at<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> 7 am. </span></span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">23 km from the last bit of the crater is the turnoff to Oldavai (5km to the museum and 6 km to the gorge).

After Olduvai, I decided to drive the 34 km to Serengeti (in Tanzania &#8211; Lake). The road was an atrocious washboard and very hard on the car. I did see a lot of animals, large herds of wildebeest (the Great Migration was in full swing), often with zebra. There were also many Thomson&#8217;s gazelle and antelope.<br /> I entered Naabi Hill Gate, and paid my park fee of US$82.60 for a 24-hour pass. The road was atrocious (even worse than the road from Olduvai) and I became worried about the car. I only drove a few kilometres inside the park and was seeing virtually what I had seen coming from Olduvai so I turned around to go back to Ngorongoro.  </em></p><p><strong>Serengeti National Park </strong>WHS. The vast plains of the Serengeti comprise 1.5 million ha of savannah. The annual migration to permanent water holes of two million wildebeests plus hundreds of thousands of gazelles and zebras – followed by their predators in their annual migration in search of pasture and water – is one of the most impressive nature spectacles in the world. The biological diversity of the park is very high with at least four globally threatened or endangered animal species: black rhinoceros, <em>elephant, wild dog, and cheetah</em>.<br /> Serengeti&#8217;s scenery is renowned for its grassland plains in the southeast where the wildebeest breed. The northern part is more hilly and rocky where the majority of hills and woodlands occur.  This is the best place to find an elephant and a giraffe. To the west, valleys, rivers and forest can be found. This area is home to crocodiles and hippopotamuses. The hippo pool located near this region is a guaranteed place to see hippos sleeping and wallering around. where the majority of hills and woodlands occur.  Several areas in the Serengeti are dotted with &#8216;koppies&#8217;, granite outcrops rising up from the plains. It&#8217;s an immense landscape and quite stunning – big sky country that feels like untamed wilderness. Although the majority of the park is open plains, the elevation does vary from 3,000 to 6,000 feet (914 to 1,828 m).<br /> A 1,000 km long annual circular trek spanning the two adjacent countries of Kenya and Tanzania through an ‘endless plains’: 25,000km<sup>2</sup> of treeless expanses of spectacularly flat short grasslands dotted with rocky outcrops (kopjes) interspersed with rivers and woodlands.<br /> Volcanic soils combined with the migration results in one of the most productive ecosystems on earth, sustaining the largest number of ungulates and the highest concentration of large predators in the world. The ecosystem supports 2 million wildebeests, 900,000 Thomson’s gazelles and 300,000 zebras as the dominant herds. Other herbivores include 7,000 elands, 27,000 topis, 18,000 hartebeests, 70,000 buffalos, 4,000 giraffes, 15,000 warthogs, 3,000 waterbucks, 2,700 elephants, 500 hippopotamuses, 200 black rhinoceroses, 10 species of antelope and 10 species of primate. Major predators include 4,000 lions, 1000 leopards, 225 cheetahs, 3,500 spotted hyenas and 300 wild dogs. Of these, the black rhino, leopard, African elephant and cheetah are on the Red List. 500 species of birds including the highest ostrich population in Tanzania and probably Africa.<br /> Overall, wildlife watchers are better off timing their trip to coincide with the drier months (June to October). Aim for June and July if you can, as the incredible wildebeest migration usually tramples the plains at this time. If you&#8217;re keen on seeing predators in action, visit in late January or February. This is the hiatus in the annual rains, when the wildebeests calve.<br /> If you are planning to visit the Serengeti and just transit through the NCA, you still have to pay the NCA fee twice: on your way going to the Serengeti and on your way back from the Serengeti. The only way to avoid paying the NCA fee twice is by exiting/entering the Serengeti via Klein’s gate on the North East, on your way to/from Lake Natron. Its a very scenic route from Kleins Gate to Lake Natron, but not enjoyed by everyone, as it has some pretty bad stretches and your drive is in a remote area.<br /> Driving through Serengeti yourself. Drive from the West entrance (thousands of Wildebeest migrating in season) to Klein&#8217;s gate. A 1650 kgs costs $10 entrance fee (and $81 personal fee) for a Tanzanian registered car. Foreign vehicles pay $40 up to 2000kgs, $150 up to 3000kgs A 4&#215;4 is good to handle the rough road.<br /> Sleep outside the park: JM Hotel 5 minutes outside the west gate, 20,000 TS<br /> On the other side in Wasso for 30.000.<br /> Guided tours may be recommended to explain the animals, habitat find some animals.</p><p><em>On my way back from Serengeti and just before reaching Ngorongoro, my right rear tire blew. The tire had a large shredded area. The left rear tire was also extremely low. Several vehicles stopped and helped change the tires. A tour guide said there was a tire repair shop 3 km away and I drove slowly, but ended up shredding this tire as it was much farther than 3 km. This is an impossible situation. Two guys in a truck arrived, we took off the second flat and drove into Kataba. </em><em>A group of Maasai offered to look after the car for 20,000. </em><em>Two new tires were 600,000 Tsh. I gave the guy who drove me 40,000 Tsh. They then took me to the bus area and I paid a tour operator 200,000 to drive me back to the car. At the park gate, I paid 35,000 Tsh for the entry for his car. He helped me change the two tires and we were back at the park gate by 18:10.<br /> In Kataba, I bought some groceries, had a good pizza for dinner and returned to the same hotel as last night.<br /> So the foolish decision to see Serengeti cost me 900,000 Tsh (about CA$450)</em></p><p>ON <em>Ava Garden Backpackers.

I encouraged him to look at immigrating to Canada which is much more about skills and qualifications. I wish him good luck.</em></p><p><strong>Tananjire NP.</strong> The name of the park originates from the Tarangire River that crosses the park. The Tarangire River is the primary source of fresh water for wild animals in the Tarangire Ecosystem during the annual dry season. The Tarangire Ecosystem is defined by the long-distance migration of wildebeest and zebras. During the dry season thousands of animals concentrate in Tarangire National Park from the surrounding wet-season dispersal and calving areas.<br /> It covers an area of approximately 2,850 square km. The landscape is composed of granitic ridges, river valleys, and swamps. Vegetation is a mix of <i>Acacia</i> woodland, <i>Combretum</i> woodland, seasonally flooded grassland, and baobab trees.<br /> The park is famous for its high density of elephants and baobab trees. Visitors to the park in the June to November dry season can expect to see large herds of thousands of zebra, wildebeest, and cape buffalo. Other common resident animals include waterbuck, giraffe, dik dik, impala, eland, Grant&#8217;s gazelle, vervet monkey, banded mongoose, and olive baboon. Predators in Tarangire include lions. leopard, caracal, honey badger, and lion, leopard, cheetah, caracal, honey badger, and African wild dog.<br /> The oldest known elephant to give birth to twins is found in Tarangire. The recent birth of elephant twins in the Tarangire National Park of Tanzania is a great example of how the birth of these two healthy and thriving twins can beat the odds.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><br /> </sup>Home to more than 550 bird species, the park is a haven for bird enthusiasts. The park is also famous for the termite mounds that dot the landscape. Those that have been abandoned are often home to dwarf mongooses. In 2015, a giraffe that is white due to leucism was spotted in the park.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"></sup></p><p><strong>I didn&#8217;t see<br /> Empakaai Crater:</strong> the stunning but relatively unknown Empakaai Crater lies some 40km northeast of its famous neighbour, the Ngorongoro Crater. From the moment you arrive at Empakaai, you will be treated to splendid views of the Empakaai Crater as well as a glimpse of Oldoinyo Lengai, Tanzania’s most active volcano. It&#8217;s a 45-minute descent into the crater through thick, mountainous forest. Down on the crater floor, there’s superb birding around the lake, and the chance to see flamingos as well as some big game like buffalo, hyena, and elephant.<br /> <strong>Gol Mountains</strong>, meaning Mountains of God, provides a surreal wilderness environment of stark, pink cliffs, enclosing the Angata Kiti pass, providing a bottleneck for the annual Great Migration of hundreds of thousands of wildebeest and zebra. This remains one of the most traditional corners of Tanzania, home to the Masaai, who still kill lions as their rite of passage into warriorhood, and who still live outside the cash economy. Don’t think you can go on a ”cultural tour, visiting the Masaai” as if they are some kind of bucket-list item to visit, and have a genuine experience. But if you go on a (multiple) guided walking safari with a good tour guide, you for sure will learn a lot about this spiritual place.<br /> Ushongo Beach<br /> Olpopongi Maasai Cultural Village and Museum<br /> <strong><br /> Day 8</strong> Sun Apr 30<br /> <em>I drove east and then south to Kolo (Kondoa Rock-art site) and inward to Dodoma.

A series of ancient paintings on rock shelter walls in central Tanzania nine kilometres east of the main highway (T5) from Dodoma to Babati.<br /> <sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"></sup>The landscape is large piled granite boulders on the western rim of the Maasai steppe and form rock shelters facing away from prevailing winds. These rock shelters often have flat surfaces due to rifting, and these surfaces are where the paintings are found, protected from weathering.<br /> These paintings are still part of a living tradition of creation and use by both Sandawe in their <i>simbó</i> healing ceremonies, and by Maasai people in ritual feasting. <sup id="cite_ref-:3_5-1" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Bwasiri_437–459_8-0" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:0_4-1" class="reference"></sup>About 1970, Sandawe men were still making rock paintings. The reasons were magical (depicting the animal that the painter intended to kill), casual, and sacrificial (on specific clan-spirit hills and depicting rain-making and healing ceremonies).<br /> <sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"></sup>The paintings depict elongated people, animals, and hunting scenes.

Nash commented on the peaceful posture of the human, doubting that the drawing was intended to depict a hunting scene. Other paintings portray giraffes, a possible rhinoceros fragment, a humanoid figure composed of concentric circles in the head and continuous lines from the top of the head to the rest of the body, and some other figures whose intended depictions were unclear.<br /> This may be the most unusual access for an WHS. Google Maps puts you in the middle of a field several kilometres from the site. If you look on Google Maps, the sites are marked in blue in the correct location. Drive though the city of Kolo to the middle of town looking for the office on the east side of the road. Go in, pay and then there is a long involved registration process first in a book and then on a phone. The guide came along in my car. It is 8.5 km from the office and a high clearance vehicle with AWD is probably necessary to navigate the last 3.5 km. Tuen east on the road just north of the office and drive for 5 km on a good dirt road. Then turn south on a rough rocky, single track road. A guard lets you through the gate and registers you again. The road crosses the dry Kolo river (that could prevent any access in flood) and then crosses some steep rocky areas 3.5 km to a parking area.<br /> Climb a steep cement/rock path to the the first site (an animal, 3 yellow stick figures carrying fruit, and two red hunters with &#8220;inverted baskets&#8221; on their heads), return a ways on a level area and climb up again to the second site in a large rock overhand (stick giraffe, more hunters with &#8220;baskets&#8221;). The explanation for the &#8220;baskets&#8221; is that they are a headdress mimicking an ostrich. Then descend to the left to the third site (dancing or romantic site with 2 pairs of couples embracing). Note that my description of the art bears no resemblance to the write-up I obtained from Worldheritagesite.org.<br /> If one does not have a car that could drive there, the guide said you could rent one for 100,000 Tsh. Another option was to walk the 8.5 km which the guide was all too willing to do (ridiculous).
