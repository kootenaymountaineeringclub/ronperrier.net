<strong>Sir Francis Drake</strong> – a great read about somebody everybody knows. May be the most historically accurate, balanced view of Drake.<br>
<strong>The Great Sea </strong>– David Abulfia. Examines the Mediterranean from ancient times to the present. #1 nonfiction book in Atlantic Books of the Year. Can be tedious reading about all the wars.<br>
<strong>Aravind Adiga</strong>. Between the Assassinations – A series of short stories set in one city in India. Very entertaining. White Tiger – another book about India. won the Man Booker Prize in 2008. Gives more insights into India.<br>
<strong>Kate Grenville</strong> – The Secret River, Sarah Thornhill. Two books in a series about a family in early Australia. Good historical fiction. Interesting account of aboriginal contact. Good read.<br>
<strong>Inside Scientology: North America’s Most Secretive Religion</strong> – Janet Reitman. Probably the most authoritative book on this cult<br>
<strong>Being Indian: Inside the Real India</strong>. Pavan Varma. A must-read for anyone traveling in India. Explains the Indian psyche that is so different than ours. Will change your view of Indians.<br>
<strong>The Sisters Brothers</strong> – Patrick deWitt. A story about 2 hired killers and the California goldrush. Entertaining but not great<br>
<strong>Damn Few: Making the Modern Seal</strong>. Rourke Denver – about the navy seals. OK read.<br>

<strong>Mexico’s Copper Canyon Country</strong> – M John Fayhee. This is a hiking and backpacking guide but he also tells entertaining stories of his adventures and the Tarahumara.<br>
<strong>Kabloona</strong> – Gontran de Poncins. This man traveled through the central Arctic (all to towns that I have worked in) over 15 months in 1938-39. The book gives many interesting observations about the Inuit. To read an excerpt I did of this book, go to IDEAS – Inuit.<br>
<strong>Kootenai Brown, His Life and Times</strong> – William Rodney. One of Canada’s true heroes that nobody has heard about. He worked for the Pony Express, hunted buffalo, guided, ranched and was the first superintendent of Waterton National Park. I hiked in Waterton for 17 summers, and like the previous two books, there were places I knew and had a special interest in.<br>
<strong>Girls Guide to Homelessness</strong> – Brianna Karp. Young American who loses job and home. This bit is not interesting but all the insights into her upbringing as a Jehova Witness are fascinating.<br>
<strong>Eating Dirt</strong> – Charlotte Gill. A well-written book about tree planting in Canada, especially Vancouver Island and BC.<br>
<strong>Ronald Wright</strong> – Cut Stones and Crossroads (about the Inca), Time Amongst the Maya<br>
<strong>Forget You Had a Daughter</strong> – Michael Tierney. About a young British woman caught smuggling heroin in Thailand. She spent 4 years in the “Bangkok Hilton” and then was transferred back to British jails – where things got worse!<br>
<strong>*A Fine Balance</strong> – Rohinton Mistry. Another great book about India – terrifying in showing how bankrupt this country is. Written about the mid-1970s, it is still just as bad today.<br>
<strong>First They Killed My Father</strong>: A Daughter of Cambodia Remembers – Loung Ung. Written through the eyes of a little girl who survived the Khmer Rouge atrocities 1975-79.<br>
<strong>The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine</strong> – Ilan Pappe. A must-read for anybody with an interest in Israel and the Middle East. Will change your mind if you have positive views of Israel and how they have kept this out of their history books and from the rest of the world.<br>
<strong>Extreme Rambling: Walking Israel’s Barrier Wall, For Fun</strong> by Mark Adams. A must-read (along with “The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine”) for anyone interested in the real story behind the illegal occupation and systematic attempt at destruction of the Palestinian Territory. Don’t believe what Israeli Jews tell you – it is all propaganda they have been fed since birth. Israel must be stopped.<br>
<strong>Jeffrey Archer</strong> – The Clifton Chronicles: #1 Only Time Will Tell, #2 The Sins of the Father, #3 Best Kept Secret, #4 Be Careful What You Wish For, #5 Mightier than the Sword, #6 Only Time Will Tell, #7 This Was a Man (last in the series). An escapist series by the well-known British author. Easy reading is best for lazy days on a beach.<br>
<strong>Pacific Rims</strong>: Beermen Ballin’ in Flip-Flops and the Philippines’ Unlikely Love Affair with Basketball – Rafe Bartholomew. Some insights into Filipino thinking but gets a little boring.<br>
<strong>Harvest: Memoir of a Mormon Missionary</strong> – Jacob Young. Very worthwhile read about Mormon thinking – fascinating.<br>
<strong>Dervla Murphy</strong>: On a Shoestring to Coorg – An Experience of Southern India (written in the 1970s, about her trip through the Western Gnats of India).<br>
<strong>The Luminaries</strong> – Eleanor Catton. Won Man Booker Prize 2013. A murder mystery set in Hokitika gold fields in New Zealand. A long book with detailed character development.<br>

<strong>I am Hutterite</strong> – Mary Ann Kirby. A fascinating look into Hutterite life. I was originally from Southern Alberta where there were many Hutterites. It was very illuminating to see communal living at its ultimate and the difficulties of leaving the colony.<br>
<strong>*Adventures and Sufferings of John Jewitt</strong>. One of the most amazing books. Recently had the chance to reread this in an edition with drawings and annotations. Very enjoyable. About an English merchant boat where, in 1802, the natives of Nootka Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island murdered 23 of the crew and took two into slavery for almost 3 years before they were rescued. A unique anthropological study especially improved with all the supplemental information provided by Hilary Stewart.<br>
<strong>Agatha Christie</strong> – Clocks. Probably the first Agatha Christie I have ever read. Short read to discover her “style”.<br>
<strong>True History of the Kelly Gang</strong> – Peter Carey. Winner of the Booker Prize. The true story of Ned Kelly, a true Australian hero.<br>
<strong>The Doukhobor People – A Tribute to Good Citizens</strong> – Ken Morrow. A sympathetic book about the Doukhobors by a man who lived in the West Kootenay in the 50s and 60s.<br>
<strong>*Honeybee Democracy</strong> – Thomas D Seeley. Investigates how honeybees swarm and find a new hive site based on democratic consensus decision-making.<br>
<strong>*Sex on Six Legs</strong> – Lessons on Life and Language from the Insect World – Marlene Zuk. Explores the fascinating, weird world of insects.<br>
<strong>*Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth</strong> – Reza Asian. Examines Jesus the man, not the Messiah. A must-read for anyone interested in Christianity, especially those creationists and evangelicals who take the bible literally (although they probably would not accept any of it, so may be a waste of time for them).<br>
<strong>Infidel My Life</strong>: Ayaan Hirsi Ali – A Somali woman raised in a strict Muslim society (she was circumcised as a child), lives in Kenya and Saudi Arabia and then moves to Holland as an immigrant. She gets an education, fights for the rights of Muslim women and children and becomes a member of parliament. Fascinating account of Muslim thinking and Dutch society and its acceptance of all societies.<br>
<strong>Ring of Fire: An Indonesian Odyssey</strong> – Laurence Blair / Lorne Blair. Two Brits who made documentary films on Indonesia back in 70-80s.<br>
<strong>Krakatoa</strong> – Simon Winchester. Besides the volcano, as informative on plate tectonics, evolution and Indonesia.<br>
<strong>Shadow of the Silk Road</strong> – Colin Thubron. One traveller’s excellent account of his journey from Xi’an to the Middle East.<br>
<strong>*The Tower</strong> – Kelly Cordes. About Cerro Torre.<br>
<strong>Decoded</strong>: A Novel – Mai Jia. About a Chinese genius who breaks ciphers.<br>
<strong>*The Private Life of Chairman Mao</strong> – Zhisiu Li. A must-read if at all interested in China and especially Mao. Written by his personal physician of 22 years. Mao was a true whacko: not educated, never brushed his teeth or bathed and wiped down with warm wet towels so never washed his genitals, a sexual monster with 100s (1000s?) of short adventures with nurses, dancers and anyone young. Details the misadventures of the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution. He could care less if millions died as “China had lots of people”. An interesting bit about preserving his body “forever” – let’s face all these are wax. Both Lenin and Ho Chi Minh had significant rot after a few years.<br>
<strong>The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao</strong> – Junot Diaz. Winner in the BBC Culture Critics’ poll and the Pulitzer Prize in fiction. About New Jersey ghetto-nerd Oscar, it reaffirms the strong connections Latinos maintain with their ancestral homeland’s culture, language and history. It re-energized these questions: Who is American? What is the American experience?”. A chilling account of Trujillo’s dictatorship in the Dominican Republic.<br>
<strong>*The Known World</strong> – Edward P Jones. Set in 1855 on the plantation of a black slave owner – this is a stunning work about humans experiencing and surviving American slavery – an epic, complex, unflinching and engrossing view of America’s messy history. #2 on the BBC Culture Critics Poll.<br>
<strong>*The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay</strong> – Michael Chabon, Pulitzer Prize winner. Joe Kavalier, a Houdini-like escape artist, smuggles himself out of Nazi-occupied Prague in 1939 and ends up in New York City. With his Brooklyn cousin Sammy Clay, he invents a superhero character called the Escapist and launches the golden age of comic books. Hilarious, this is the second book I have read by Chabon – he is the best.<br>
<strong>The Corrections</strong> (2001) – Jonathan Franzen. Winner of a US National Book Award, this big, sprawling, fat, edgy multigenerational family saga touches on some of the most important themes of the early years of this millennium – economic uncertainty, the conflicts between parents and their drifting middle-aged children and the enormous issues of an aging society past its prime. He does it with great storytelling and a lot of humour.<br>
<strong>Solar</strong> – Ian McEwan (Atonement). Clever book. Picked up in a hostel in Tel Aviv and nice to read the paper again.<br>
<strong>Bad-Assed Librarians</strong> by Joshua Hammer – Timbuktu has been the repository of Islamic and historical literature for North Africa for over a century. When threatened by terrorists, 372,000 of the 377,000 manuscripts were smuggled out and are now stored in Bamako, the capital of Mali.<br>
<strong>Sapiens, Homo Deus</strong>. Yuval Noah Harari – the evolution of our species and its rise to defy the laws of natural selection and enter the Anthropocene Epoch.<br>
<strong>A Visit From the Goon Squad</strong> – Jennifer Egan. Won the National Book Critics Circle and Pulitzer awards. A narrative around a punk rocker-turned-music producer, his sticky-fingered assistant and a circle of wannabes, has-beens and hangers-on. Juxtaposes timeless literary themes, most notably the inexorable journey from youth to age, with an exploration of how a rapidly changing world reshapes the human experience.<br>
<strong>No Way Down</strong> – Graham Bowley. Relates the story of the climb of K2 in 2008 when 11 climbers died – another story of too many people on a mountain who despite the goals of cooperation, didn’t.<br>
<strong>*The Enigma</strong> – The life of Alan Turing, a genius in the class of Newton, Darwin and Einstein.<br>
<strong>The Year of Living Danishly</strong> – Uncovering the Secrets of the World’s Happiest Country. Helen Russell. This book was a fascinating look at Denmark from the view of an expatriate. Every country should have one of these and I would love to see one on Japan and South Korea. “Being Indian” is great about India.<br>
<strong>Prisoners of Geography</strong> – Ten Maps That Explain Everything About the World. Tim Marshall. A concise overview of the world’s history and how differing geography affected history. Very informative.<br>
<strong>The Five Love Languages</strong> – How to Express Heartfelt Commitment to Your Mate – Gary Chapman. A must-read for anyone in a relationship – couples and families with children. One more way to look at relationships, but possibly the easiest to put into practice. The five languages are Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Receiving Gifts, Acts of Service or Physical Touch.<br>
<strong>When Breath Becomes Air</strong> – Paul Kalanithi. A neurosurgery resident develops terminal lung cancer and finds god.<br>
<strong>Heart of Darkness</strong> – Joseph Conrad. One of the worst books I have ever read. I was in the Congo when I read it and learned nothing about the Congo. The book is wordy description and all about Kurtz, a trader who appears briefly at the end of the book. I had traded Kindles with another passenger and there was not much to read in his Kindle, but I did stick it out.<br>
<strong>We Were Soldiers Once….And Young</strong> – la Drang – the Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam – Lt. Gen. Harold G. Moore (Ret) and Joseph L Galloway. About the first big battle in Vietnam. 306 Americans and 4000 Viet Cong lost their lives. The book is an endless story of death. The best part may be the very end when they discuss the decision to continue the war. 58,000 Americans were eventually killed. I would not recommend reading this book.<br>
<strong>Shadow of the Silk Road</strong> – Colin Thubron. Interesting with much history but his writing gets a little boring.<br>
<strong>In Xanadu</strong> – Willian Dalrymple Does the road from the Middle East to Beijing. This is the first book I have read by this English travel writer and I want to read more. He is very entertaining with a great sense of humour and an eye for travelling. Much better than the previous book on the “Silk Road”.<br>
<strong>*A World Without Us</strong> – Alan Weisman. A great read about many fascinating subjects about how we have impacted our planet and how long these effects will last.<br>
<strong>No Picnic on Mount Kenya</strong> – Felice Benuzzi. 3 POWs from a prisoner of war camp in Kenya escape and climb the mountain then return to the camp.<br>
<strong>SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome</strong> – Mary Beard. SPQR (Senatus Populus Que Romanus). A masterly new chronicle, by Britain’s most engaging historian of the ancient world, about Rome from its myth-shrouded origins to the early third century. She shows that the key to its dominance was granting citizenship to so many people.<br>
<strong>*The Underground Railroad</strong> – Colton Whitehead. A Pulitzer Prize-winning book.<br>
<strong>Neurotribes: The Legacy of Autism and the Future of Neurodiversity</strong>. By Steve Silberman. How a widely contested condition grew out of conflicts between Nazi psychiatrists anxious for career advancement. The descriptions of how autistic children were treated in the 20th century is especially shocking. Winner of the 2015 Samuel Johnson prize for non-fiction. While reading this book, I came to believe that I am autistic –  a high-functioning Asperger.<br>
<strong>The Journal of Best Practices: A Memoir of Marriage, Asperger Syndrome, and One Man’s Quest to Be a Better Husband</strong> by David Finch<br>
<strong>Aspergers in Love: Couple Relationships and Family Affairs </strong>by Maxine Aston, Christopher Slater-Walker<br>
<strong>The Complete Guide to Asperger’s Syndrome</strong> by Tony Attwood. The best book available on high-functioning Asperger’s.<br>
<strong>Spying on Whales</strong> – Nick Pyenson. A fascinating book about all things whale.<br>
<strong>The Power of Neurodiversity</strong> – Thomas Armstrong, PhD. Discusses the positive aspects of ADHD, dyslexia, autism, mood disorders, anxiety, intelligence, and schizophrenia. See my book High-Functioning Aspergers Syndrome as a summary of this book is there.<br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><strong>A Brief History of Seven Killings</strong> – Malon James. Man Booker winner 2015. About Jamaican gangs in Kingston, Miami and New York. Not so interesting with some characters that seem to add little to the story (a CIA agent and a woman who appears in all three sections). A lot of dialogue and swearing. </span><br>
<strong>Plucked: A History of Hair Removal.</strong> By Rebecca Herzig. Most of Earth’s mammals possess luxuriant fur. Only one seeks to remove it. A curious account of hair-erasing, and why people have tried clamshell razors, lasers, lye depilatories, tweezers, waxes, threading and electrolysis to try and free themselves from hairiness. Self-enhancement or oppression?<br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><strong>Breasts and Eggs</strong> – Kieko Kawakami. A novel about womanhood in Japan, but a harsh description of Japanese society. </span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><strong>Empire of Cotton:</strong> A Global History. By Sven Beckert. By focusing on a sector that until 1900 was the world’s most important manufacturing industry, Sven Beckert offers a fine account of 900 years of globalisation.<br>
<strong>Harpoon of the Hunter</strong> – Markoosie. Based on an Inuit legend, Harpoon of the Hunter is a story of life in the old days, not as it appeared to Southerners, but as it has survived in the memory of the Inuit themselves. Emerging from a largely oral tradition, it is the first novel by an Inuit written in English. Markoosie has the rare ability to capture the richness and imagery of the Inuit language in English.<br>
<strong>The Satanic Verses:</strong> Salman Rushdie.<br>
<strong>*Tales From the Ant World</strong> – Edward O Wilson. Fascinating (The Superorganism, Journey to the Ants, Insect Societies)<br>
<strong>***The Meaning of Human Existence</strong> – Edward O Wilson. One of the best books I have ever read, especially the section on Are there Extraterrestrials?<br>
<strong>**First Steps</strong> – Jeremy De Silva – Another fascinating book about bipedalism – the first thing that started the separation of humans from primates from our common ancestor, about 8 million years ago. Has a great section on walking that I have reproduced on my About and Hiking pages.<br>
<strong>**A History of the Human Brain</strong> – Bret Stetka. A fascinating look at the evolution of the human brain, the ultimate creation.<br>
<strong>The Dawn of Everything</strong> – David Graeber. Reexamines the premise that after hunter-gatherers, we did not turn into selfish war-like people caused by the trappings of modern civilization. Unfortunately, it is written in a rather boring, repetitive style.<br>
<strong>*The Vital Question: Why Is Life the Way It Is?</strong> By Nick Lane. A persuasive and demanding attempt, by a thought-provoking British scientist, a biochemist at University College London, to answer some of the most fundamental questions in biology. It posits a new theory of how life came to be.<br>
<strong>Man’s Search for Meaning</strong> – Victor Frankl. A holocaust survivor and psychiatrist presents an interesting life philosophy. One of the most read and reprinted books of all time.<br>
<strong>Seven Brief Lessons on Physics.</strong> By Carlo Rovelli. Translated by Simon Carnell and Erica Segre. A startling and illustrative distillation of centuries of science by an Italian theoretical physicist. Simon Carnell and Erica Segre, a poet and a translator, have preserved the book’s lyrical and stripped-down prose.<br>
<strong>*How to Change Your Mind:</strong> Michael Pollan. Another great book by Pollan. It will want you to try psychedelics, a class of drugs making a resurgence to treat addictions, depression, dealing with dying from cancer and finding your spiritual inner being.<br>
<strong>The New Jim Crow.</strong> How mass incarceration and the war on drugs have become the new way to subjugate blacks in America. Unfortunately written in a very repetitive style and could have been one-third the size.<br>
<strong>*War Doctor:</strong> David Nott. A compelling story of a British surgeon who repetitively goes to the hell-spots of the world – Darfur Sudan, CAR, and the worst Syria. Recommended by Dr Rich Davis, an American surgeon working in Kenya.<br>
<strong>Testaments:</strong> Margaret Atwood. The follow-up book to “The Handmaid’s Tale” and the fall of Gilead. Great Book by a wonderful Canadian author.<br>
<strong>*The Hospital by the River:</strong> Dr Catherine Hamlin. One of the best medical books I have ever read and heartily recommended. It is about Drs Reg and Catherine Hamlin, an Australian obstetrician/gynecologist couple who went to Ethiopia and eventually established a world-famous fistula hospital in Addis Ababa. Heart rendering. May 2024.<br>
This book and War Doctor (above) were both recommended to me by Dr Richard Davis who I met on a beach </span>in Lamu, Kenya. We talked for a long time about medicine and Asperger’s. Dr Davis has devoted his life to work as a surgeon in Africa. He also wrote the <span class="acss8af2a">Manual of Surgery in Resource Limited Setting.<br>
<strong>**The Covenant of Water</strong> – Abraham Verghese. About Kerala, India 1900-77. A family is stricken by multigenerational drownings due to an inherited acoustic neuroma that produces disorientation in water. It also includes a great intuitive Danish Physician and the birth of a breech baby by the matriarch of the family. Leprosy is a major thread throughout the book.  Verghese also wrote “Cutting for Stone”, both wonderful reads full of great medicine.<br>
<strong>*Shark Going Inland is My Chief – </strong>A good book about navigation used to settle the South Pacific and a thorough history of Hawaii.<br>
</span><strong>Shuggie Bain</strong> – Douglas Stuart. Won the Man Booker Prize. Life in Glasgow, Scotland. Good writing but it gets depressing.<br>

<strong>Zadie Smith.</strong> On Beauty. Well written but not my kind of story.<br>
<strong>The Surgeon of Crowthorne</strong> – Simon Winchester. The intriguing account of the writing of the Oxford English Dictionary. This monumental task required almost 5 decades. The book is about James Murray, the editor, and the main contributor to the dictionary, an American army surgeon incarcerated in an insane asylum (he had paranoid schizophrenia)  for a murder in London. Highly recommended.<br>

<strong>Politics and current affairs</strong><br>
Near and Distant Neighbours: A New History of Soviet Intelligence. By Jonathan Haslam – A detailed appraisal of how the Soviet Union handled undercover operations from the communist revolution in 1917 until the end of the cold war. The most gripping chapters focus on the chaos that was unleashed by Josef Stalin.<br>
Our Kids: The American Dream in Crisis. By Robert Putnam – The most important divide in America today is class, not race, and the place where it matters most is in the home. In a thoughtful and persuasive book, the former dean of Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government analyses the growing gulf between how the rich and the poor raise their children, adding a liberal voice to long-standing conservative complaints about family breakdown.<br>
North Korea Confidential: Private Markets, Fashion Trends, Prison Camps, Dissenters and Defectors. By Daniel Tudor and James Pearson. – Two knowledgeable journalists offer a bird’s-eye view of everyday life that teases out how the famine of the 1990s prompted unexpected change in the attitudes, governance and lives of ordinary North Koreans, giving the lie to the simplistic view that Koreans are a homogenous people under the thumb of a power-crazed dictator.<br>
Ghettoside: Investigating a Homicide Epidemic. By Jill Leovy – Black men are still dying at alarming rates in the toughest urban pockets even though, overall, America’s murder rate is down. A study of one neighbourhood in Los Angeles has the power to change how people think about policing in America.<br>
Once in a Great City: A Detroit Story. By David Maraniss. One of America’s finest non-fiction writers, a son of Detroit, offers a lively and meticulously researched account of how the city, once the engine room of America, began sputtering.</p> <p><strong>History</strong><br>
Nagasaki: Life after Nuclear War. By Susan Southard. The searing account of five teenage hibakusha (“explosion-affected people”): how they survived the atom bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki in 1945, and the terrible price they paid in the aftermath of the war.<br>
Waterloo: The History of Four Days, Three Armies and Three Battles. By Bernard Cornwell. A great and terrible story of a battle that was fought 200 years ago, told with energy and clarity by a writer who has a deep understanding of men in combat and why they do what they do. “Waterloo” proves that Bernard Cornwell’s non-fiction is as fine as his novels, if not finer.<br>
What the Eye Hears: A History of Tap Dancing. By Brian Seibert. How tap-dancing entertained many, even as it had clear racist overtones. An engaging, warts-and-all history of one of America’s greatest creative inventions by a dance critic at the New York Times.<br>
Towards the Flame: Empire, War and the End of Tsarist Russia. By Dominic Lieven. How Russia went to war. A gripping, poignant and in some respects revolutionary contribution to European history by a distinguished British scholar who is descended from several of the protagonists he describes.<br>
<strong><br>
Biography and memoir</strong><br>
Kissinger: The Idealist, 1923-1968. By Niall Ferguson. Penguin Press; 1,008 pages. The magisterial first instalment of a two-part biography about a man who towered over American foreign policy for more than two decades, and still divides opinion as no one else does.<br>
Skyfaring: A Journey with a Pilot. By Mark Vanhoenacker. A highly readable account, as moving as it is unexpected, of what flying means, by an airline pilot with a gift for words. Antoine de Saint-Exupéry lives again.<br>
Ted Hughes: The Unauthorised Life. By Jonathan Bate. It is hard to write a literary account of Ted Hughes without writing about the life, as many authors have found. Five years in the making, this biography began as an authorised life only to become unauthorised when the author fell out with Hughes’s widow, Carol, over how much personal detail to include, prompting the poet’s estate to withdraw its co-operation.<br>
The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt’s New World. By Andrea Wulf. Explorer, polymath, friend of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Thomas Jefferson and Simon Bolívar, Alexander von Humboldt was one of the greatest scientists of the 19th century. His ideas are as relevant today as they ever were.<br>
<strong><br>
Economics and business</strong><br>
The Public Wealth of Nations: How Management of Public Assets Can Boost or Bust Economic Growth. By Dag Detter and Stefan Fölster. Governments have trillions of dollars in assets, from companies to forests, but they are often poorly managed. Two investment experts explain how things could be improved by ring-fencing assets from political meddling in independent holding companies. Professional managers could sweat them as if they were privately owned.<br>
Other People’s Money: The Real Business of Finance. By John Kay. If the world is to avoid future banking collapses, or at least limit their economic impact, people need to think clearly about what the finance sector is for. This book does the job.<br>
Inequality: What Can Be Done? By Anthony Atkinson. A crunchy book that analyses policy discussions in detail but avoids dullness, thanks to its unapologetic support for robust government intervention.<br>
Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioural Economics. By Richard Thaler. Why people don’t behave the way economic models predict lies at the heart of this brilliant intellectual history by the founder of this once-obscure blend of psychology and economics.<br>
Economics Rules: The Rights and Wrongs of the Dismal Science. By Dani Rodrik. Economists still have a lot of explaining to do. Dani Rodrik reassures those outside the profession of the helpfulness of economists, and also removes some of the wishful thinking from his colleagues.<br>
Circus Maximus: The Economic Gamble Behind Hosting the Olympics and the World Cup. By Andrew Zimbalist. Any country thinking of hosting an international sporting jamboree should read this book to see what a bad deal the IOC and FIFA seek to foist on them. Hamburg has just voted against bidding for the 2024 Olympic games. Clever move.<br>
<strong><br>
Culture, society and travel</strong><br>
The Road to Character. By David Brooks. The author, a columnist for the New York Times, clearly thinks people are too full of themselves. A thoughtful polemic on why the self-regarding Facebook generation should move from narcissism to thoughtfulness. They’d be much happier.<br>
Unfinished Business: Women Men Work Family. By Anne-Marie Slaughter. Why organisations will have to change radically to make work-life balance a reality, by a respected foreign-policy expert who left her high-octane government job to spend more time with her two teenage sons. A rational, well-argued call to arms. Move over Sheryl Sandberg.<br>
Between the World and Me. By Ta-Nehisi Coates. In a homage to James Baldwin’s “The Fire Next Time”, a father writes a warning letter to his teenage son about growing up black. The year’s most talked-about book on race relations in America.<br>
Schubert’s Winter Journey: An Anatomy of an Obsession. By Ian Bostridge. One of Britain’s foremost tenors, Ian Bostridge has performed Schubert’s “Winterreise” more than 100 times. He knows every last nuance of the work and his book offers many fresh insights that will inform the enjoyment of both old admirers and newcomers to the music.<br>
Nemesis: One Man and the Battle for Rio. By Misha Glenny. How Antonio Francisco Bonfim Lopes, better known as Nem of Rocinha, became a drug-dealer after his daughter was diagnosed with a rare disease and he needed the cash—and how he eventually took over an entire Brazilian shantytown.</p> <p><strong>SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY </strong><br>
<strong>Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction.</strong> By Philip Tetlock and Dan Gardner. A scientific analysis of the ancient art of divination which shows that forecasting is a talent; luckily it can be learned. You need a healthy appetite for information, a willingness to revisit predictions in light of new data, and the ability to synthesise material from sources with very different outlooks on the world.<br>
<strong>Humans Need Not Apply: A Guide to Wealth and Work in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</strong>. By Jerry Kaplan. An intriguing, insightful and well-written look at how modern artificial intelligence, powering algorithms and robots, threatens jobs and may increase wealth inequalities, by a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and AI expert.<br>
<strong>Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension.</strong> By Matt Parker. Officially described as “a riotous journey through the possibilities of numbers, with audience participation”, this is an unusual, in-depth but highly accessible popular-maths book by a member of the London Mathematical Society who also has a sideline in stand-up comedy.<br>
<strong>The New Wild: Why Invasive Species Will Be Nature’s Salvation</strong>. By Fred Pearce. A carefully researched, analytical look at the effects that new species have on different environments into which they are introduced. The book debunks poor science and the cherry-picking of statistical examples to feed hysteria about keeping invasive species out and protecting an imaginary perfect past.<br>
<strong>Adventures in Human Being.</strong> By Gavin Francis. A Scottish doctor, once the medical officer on a British research mission near the South Pole, takes a delightful journey closer to home, through the wondrous human body, from top to tail, inside to out.<br>
<strong>Spirals in Time: The Secret Life and Curious Afterlife of Seashells</strong>. By Helen Scales. A marine biologist-turned-science writer describes coming face-to-shell with a giant clam on the Great Barrier Reef, enjoying a bag of smoked oysters in Gambia and meeting a sea-silk seamstress in Italy. She makes an impassioned and convincing argument that, contrary to expectations, molluscs have much to teach us.<br>
<strong>How to Talk about Videogames.</strong> By Ian Bogost. Some say video games are the great sport of the 21st century, the summit of art and entertainment. Others call them mindless. Meditative essays on the meaning of gaming, by a game designer and professor of interactive computing.<br>

<strong>The Fishermen</strong>. By Chigozie Obioma. A lyrical retelling of the Cain-and-Abel story in which four Nigerian brothers play truant from school, go fishing and meet a soothsayer who predicts that one brother will kill another. Not yet 30, Chigozie Obioma is a writer to watch.<br>
<strong>Seiobo There Below.</strong> By Laszlo Krasznahorkai. Translated by Ottilie Mulzet. Seventeen stories by a Hungarian modernist whose sentences wind and unwind and rewind, creating what one translator described as “a slow lava-flow of narrative, a vast black river of type”. A fitting winner of the 2015 Man Booker International prize.<br>
<strong>Submission.</strong> By Michel Houellebecq. No other French novelist knows how to stir trouble quite like Michel Houellebecq. This account of France under Muslim rule is set in 2022. It came out on the day of the Charlie Hebdo attack and has been called scaremongering. Its fans say it speaks to France’s deepest secret fears.<br>
<strong>A Little Life.</strong> By Hanya Yanagihara. On the surface a story about four university graduates trying to make it in New York, at heart Hanya Yanagihara’s second novel is a fairy-tale about child abuse, pitting good against evil, love against viciousness, hope against hopelessness. It has divided critics, but readers love it. Hypnotic despite its length and considerable flaws.<br>
<strong>An Account of the Decline of the Great Auk, According to One Who Saw It</strong>. By Jessie Greengrass. Restraint and a formal writing style, by a philosophy graduate from Cambridge University, give a tone of melancholy to this spectacularly accomplished, chilly debut collection of short stories about thwarted lives and opportunities missed. The strongest are also the most ordinary.<br>
<strong>The Story of the Lost Child.</strong> By Elena Ferrante. Translated by Ann Goldstein. This four-volume narrative, with all its operatic overtones, is a tribute to feminism and female friendship in mid-20th-century Naples. Written by a pseudonymous author whose real identity remains unknown and translated by an editor at the New Yorker, it is a wild and unlikely hit on both sides of the Atlantic.</p> <p><strong>12 BEST NOVELS OF THE 21ST CENTURY</strong> – The BBC Culture Critics Poll (*I’ve read)<br>
12. *Middlesex (2002) – Jeffrey Eugenides. At 14, Calliope Stephanides discovers she has a rare recessive mutation that renders her a pseudo-hermaphrodite. Claiming her “male brain”, she shifts genders and becomes Cal. Ultimately Cal’s condition gives him a near-mythic gift – the ability to communicate between the genders, to see not with the monovision of one sex but in the stereoscope of both. Middlesex bridged the gap between critical and commercial acclaim, as well as winning a Pulitzer and selling millions of copies.<br>
11. White Teeth (2000) – Zadie Smith<br>
Won the Whitbread and Guardian first book awards. Set in London, is chockablock with vivid scenes and characters, a portrait of postcolonial multicultural London. Her continuing work includes two other novels named by critics in the BBC Culture poll – NW, which ranked at number 18, and On Beauty.<br>
10. Half of a Yellow Sun (2006) – Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,<br>
A serious political novel about love in wartime, the Biafra conflict traumatised her country and her family for three years after the Igbo people of eastern Nigeria seceded in 1967. Adichie’s 2013 novel Americanah also ranked high in the poll, but missed out on a spot in the top 12 by one vote.<br>
9. *Atonement (2001) – Ian McEwan<br>
McEwan’s haunting and beautifully crafted novel opens with Briony witnesses her 15-year-old cousin Lola being assaulted in the darkened woods. Her testimony implicates Robbie, her sister Cecilia’s boyfriend and he is jailed. In a second section, McEwan gives a panoramic account of the harrowing evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940, with Robbie among those saved. Briony works as a nurse during the Blitz in a third section. As McEwan follows these characters through six decades, Briony’s search for redemption evolves into a meditation on the power of art.<br>
8. *Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk (2012) – Ben Fountain<br>
Winner of a National Book Critics Circle award, is about eight rookies from the US army’s Bravo squad, fresh from a firefight with Iraqi insurgents. Dubbed war heroes by the Fox News cable channel, their two-week stateside victory tour ends with a halftime salute at a Dallas Cowboys game. Fountain captures the excesses of Texas, American football, business and war.<br>
7. *A Visit from the Goon Squad (2010) – Jennifer Egan,<br>
Won the National Book Critics Circle and Pulitzer awards. A narrative around a punk rocker-turned-music producer, his sticky-fingered assistant and a circle of wannabes, has-beens and hangers-on. Juxtaposes timeless literary themes, most notably the inexorable journey from youth to age, with an exploration of the ways in which a rapidly changing world reshapes the human experience.<br>
6. *The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay (2000) – Michael Chabon,<br>
Pulitzer Prize winner. Joe Kavalier, a Houdini-like escape artist, smuggles himself out of Nazi-occupied Prague in 1939 and ends up in New York City. With his Brooklyn cousin Sammy Clay he invents a superhero character called the Escapist and launches the golden age of comic books.<br>
5. *The Corrections (2001) – Jonathan Franzen,<br>
Winner of a US National Book Award, this big, sprawling, fat, edgy multigenerational family saga touches on some of the most important themes of the early years of this millennium – economic uncertainty, the conflicts between parents and their drifting middle-aged children and the enormous issues of an aging society past its prime. He does it with great storytelling and a lot of humour.<br>
4. Gilead (2004) – Marilynne Robinson,<br>
The Rev John Ames, a small-town Iowa minister, describes his life and anti-slavery heritage to his young son in dazzling lyrical language in this first installment of Robinson’s trilogy (along with Home and Lila). Few living novelists write more seriously and profoundly about religious faith.<br>
3. *Wolf Hall (2009) – Hilary Mantel<br>
Won the Man Booker and National Book Critics Circle awards, was adapted to the stage and has been filmed as a new BBC miniseries. Told from the perspective of Thomas Cromwell (with Henry VIII as a supporting character), it brilliantly retells an oft-told tale. Mantel’s flawless examination of power completely catapults the reader into the character’s mind. Mantel’s sequel, Bring in the Bodies, also gathered votes.<br>
2. *The Known World (2003) – Edward P Jones,<br>
Set in 1855 on the plantation of Henry Townsend – born a slave, now a slave-owner – this is a triumph of empathy, immersing readers in a complex moral time without making simple judgments. Facing an early death, Townsend ponders the future of his 50-acre Virginia plantation and the slaves he treats the way his former owner, now his mentor, taught him. This may be the best American novel published in the 21st Century – a stunning work about humans experiencing and surviving American slavery – an epic, complex, unflinching and engrossing view of America’s messy history.<br>
1. *The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao (2007) – Junot Díaz,<br>
Winner in this BBC Culture critics’ poll and the Pulitzer Prize in fiction. About New Jersey ghetto-nerd Oscar, it reaffirms the strong connections Latinos maintain with their ancestral homeland’s culture, language and history. It re-energised these questions: Who is American? What is the American experience?”<br>

The Ridiculous Race by Steve Hely and Vali Chandrasekaran — Two young comedy writers (they went on to write for 30 Rock!) decide to race each other around the world without airplanes. I’ve never laughed so hard from a travel memoir in my life.<br>
The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway — My favorite book of all time. This novel depicts the wild lives of the “lost generation” expats living in Paris and traveling around Europe in the 1930s.<br>
Into Thin Air by John Krakauer — After reading this memoir, you will join me in swearing that you will never, EVER attempt to climb Mount Everest. Journalist John Krakauer happened to be on the disastrous expedition of 1996.<br>
Love With a Chance of Drowning by Torre DeRoche — When you fall in love with a man planning to sail across the Pacific and he invites you to join him, you don’t let your fear of water stand in the way. This hilarious, sweet and heartfelt memoir was written by a friend of mine.<br>
The Post-Birthday World by Lionel Shriver — No writer moves me like Lionel Shriver. After I read this novel, I couldn’t stop thinking about the characters for months. It’s not as travel-oriented as the others, but it absolutely nails life as an American expat in London.<br>
Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil by John Berendt — Savannah is a CRAZY city, y’all. This “nonfiction novel” will blow you away — it doesn’t seem like a place like this can be real. Savannah is painted as a closed-off town with characters that would even Dickens would think are extreme.<br>
Mastering the Art of French Eating by Ann Mah — You’ve just moved to Paris with your beloved husband — but as soon as you arrive, he gets transferred to Baghdad for a year. What can you do? Well, you spend a year diving into French food and writing about it. Delicious, sweet memoir.<br>
Moonlight in Odessa by Janet Skeslien Charles — A fun and surprising novel about life in Odessa, Ukraine, in the 1990s, which at that time was run by the Mafia, and a brilliant young woman who takes a job working for a mail-order bride company.<br>
Wild by Cheryl Strayed — Cheryl lost her mother, her marriage, and was descending into heroin addiction. So she decided to spend months hiking the Pacific Crest Trail on her own, despite having zero experience. A beautiful, real, transformative memoir about the power of solo female travel.<br>
When You Are Engulfed in Flames by David Sedaris — I love David Sedaris’s witty essay collections, but this one has some particularly great travel moments, including a lengthy story about using a trip to Japan to quit smoking.<br>
Bringing Up Bebe by Pamela Druckerman– Why are French children so polite and well-behaved? An American writer and her British husband raise three children in Paris and compare French and Anglo parenting firsthand. Even if you’re not a parent, it contains fascinating nuances about French culture, behavior, and priorities.<br>
Where’s You Go, Bernadette? by Mara Semple — A fun, quick and unusually buoyant beach read. This novel takes in a wacky artist who goes missing and her daughter and husband’s journey to Antarctica to find her.<br>
Crazy Rich Asians by Kevin Kwan — Another fun beach read about the stratospherically rich Chinese living in Singapore and their quirky behavior. While the characterization leaves a bit to be desired, this is a fascinating culture to discover for a few hours and you can tell the author knows a lot about this world!<br>
Tales of a Female Nomad by Rita Golden Gelman — At age 48, following a sudden divorce, Rita decided to sell her possessions and become a nomad, living simply among locals for months to years at a time, from Mexico to Bali to the Galapagos. What she was doing was revolutionary at the time — she’s like our digital nomad grandmother!<br>
Eat, Pray, Love and its sequel, Committed, by Elizabeth Gilbert — Loved, reviled, and justifiably famous, because Elizabeth Gilbert is one of the most joyful writers alive today. These books are beautifully self-aware and showcase the healing power of travel.<br>
Drink, Play, F*ck — A funny faux memoir told from the point of view of Gilbert’s husband, who goes on to drink in Ireland, gamble in Vegas, and, um, get busy in Thailand.</p> <p><strong>Books about Mongolia</strong>:<br>

Storm of Steel – Ernst Junger. Written in 1920 about a German soldiers experiences in WWI, it charts the evolution of trench warfare and is a war classic. War simply happens, and when it does, it is neither good or bad, but “the great, the overwhelming, the hallowed experience”. The first translation from 1929 was poor, but this from 2004 is much better. (Penguin Classics)<br>
Indonesia Epic: Exploring the Improbable Nation – Elizabeth Pisani. Travel book (she spent 1 year in Indonesia) devotes large parts of the book to even most Indonesians know nothing about. Java and Bali receive scant attention. 13,466 islands, 360 ethnic groups, 719 languages held together by a national language and 32 years of dictatorship now decentralizing itself but with Islam, strong family, clan, village and island ties. Personal networks are so strong that corruption holds the country together – patronage is the price of unity.<br>

By BootsnAll and the BootsnAll Community | April 15th, 2013</p> <p>Most travelers also have an affinity for reading. All the time we spend in airports and on planes, buses, and trains make for the perfect situation to pick up a good book and get lost. There’s nothing better than reading a book set in a destination I’ve been or dream of going. There are a lot of great books out there that are great for travelers, so we talked amongst ourselves here at BootsnAll and asked our community for suggestions. We were overwhelmed with awesome suggestions, many of which we hadn’t heard of before. So we put together this list of top travel books:<br>
1. *Vagabonding: An Uncommon Guide to the Art of Long-Term World Travel – Rolf Potts: This book inspired a whole new generation of backpackers and long-term indie travelers by the Voice of Generation X and Y traveler, Rolf Potts. Most of the content is not “how to” – which is commonplace on the web today, but philosophical and helps would be AND experienced travelers with the stuff that goes on in your head. CEO and Co-founder of BootsnAll said this about the book Vagabonding, “If there is one book on this list to read, read this one. I’ve read it multiple times, given it as a gift to folks old and young, and the book stand the test of time. Get one, read it, and GO”<br>
2. The Rough Guide to First-Time Around The World – Doug Lansky: A great book for those who want to take a long-term trip for the very first time. Outlines all the basics as well as gritty details necessary to get you started. A must-read for first-time RTW travelers.<br>
3. World’s Cheapest Destinations – Tim Leffel: This fourth edition was released in early 2013 and is a great guide for those of you looking for the best budget destinations around the world. Even if you’re a mid-range traveler, you can find a lot of value in Tim Leffel’s boo<br>
4. Take Me With You – Brad Newsham: Long-time friend of BootsnAll, Brad Newsham wrote this book over 10 years ago now. It’s an epic story, of Brad’s mission to bring someone back from his travels, something many folks feel after doing some intensive indie travel. Brad wears his heart on his sleeve in everything he does, and this book is no different. Enjoy.<br>

The author motivates this simple rider-elephant metaphor in 10 powerful chapters in which he supports ancient wisdom with the latest scientific research to help us understand what happiness is and how we can get it. And, it’s not by sitting around meditating.<br>
9. The World’s Most Dangerous Places – Robert Young Pelton: “Robert Young Pelton, a professional adventurer, and his team of international war correspondents have updated this indispensable handbook for the intrepid adventurer– a “how-to” in getting in and out of the world′s hot spots.” – Synopsis from Good Reads<br>

They became attached to each other, and Kerasote decided to name the dog Merle and bring him home. There, he realized that Merle’s native intelligence would be diminished by living exclusively in the human world. He put a dog door in his house so Merle could live both outside and in. A deeply touching portrait of a remarkable dog and his relationship with the author, Merle’s Door explores the issues that all animals and their human companions face as their lives intertwine, bringing to bear the latest research into animal consciousness and behavior as well as insights into the origins and evolution of the human-dog partnership. Merle showed Kerasote how dogs might live if they were allowed to make more of their own decisions, and Kerasote suggests how these lessons can be applied universally.” – Synopsis from Good Reads<br>

While laughs are a great part of Troost’s books, they are also very informative and offer great insights into the countries he visits and lives in.<br>
30. *A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail – Bill Bryson: This was my introduction to Bryson, and I have come back to it a few times since the first read.

72. The Open Road: The Global Journey of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama – Pico Iyer: “In “The Open Road,” Iyer takes a long, hard look at the many meanings of this deceptively simple man. At first blush, one might wonder why Iyer, best known as the author of many travel memoirs including “Video Night in Kathmandu” and “Sun After Dark,” would take on such a subject. The answer lies in the understanding that Iyer is not just a travel writer, and the Dalai Lama is not just a monk.” – Holly Morris, New York Times<br>

83. The Golden Bough – Sir James G. Frazer: It’s a cross cultural survey of traditional rituals, taboos, sacrifices, myths, and superstitions — from Europe to Asia, from American Indians to African tribes. Often in our travels we notice that seemingly very different cultures may have similar practices – We find totem poles in Vancouver, and yet we find similar totemic practices in southern China and even in Hungary. We often wonder how this could be possible, and Frazer’s book tells us why. For the cultural traveler it’s an incredible book of insights and an invaluable tool to help us get the most out of our travels. – Bruce<br>

Setting out from Kublai Khan’s capital, Beijing, Becker was one of the first westerners to cross the border. Tracing the course of the Yellow River, he ventured deep into the heart of Mongolia, witnessing the birth of one of the world’s youngest democracies as well as the deep and tragic impact of the rules of Mao and Stalin on the Mongolian people.” -Synopsis from Good Reads<br>

Genghis Khan: Life, Death, and Resurrection- John Man: “John Man’s absorbing and beautifully written book investigates a vast amount of evidence, much of it partial, much of it conflicting and much of it mysterious, to produce a thrilling account of Genghis’s life, death and his continuing influence.”<br>
88. Empire of the Soul: Some Journeys in India – Paul William Roberts: “One of the finest travel writers has taken on the most impenetrable country, describing his spiritual pilgrimages of the ’70s and return visits of the ’90s. Paul William Roberts says “[India] is the only country that feels like home to me, the only country whose airport tarmac I have ever kissed upon landing.” But no sentimentality dulls Roberts’s keen eye as he visits ashrams, junkie dens, and Mother Teresa’s order, explaining the complex history of castes and colonialization as he goes. He ferrets out beauty and hypocrisy with an insightful take on the masses of humanity that travel and live there.”<br>

– Peter Allison: “Ever the gifted storyteller and cultural observer, Allison makes many observations about life in humid climes, the nature of nomadism, and exactly what it is like to be nearly blasted off a mountain by the famous Patagonia wind. Allison’s self-deprecating humor is as delightful as his crazy stunts, and his love for animals—even when they bite—is infectious.” – Synopsis from Good Reads<br>
