Courtenay\/Comox  HIKES  Nymph Falls \u2013 Forbidden Plateau    RIVER SNORKELLING CAMPBELL RIVER \u00a0(salmon run) Each fall millions upon millions of salmon return to the coast of British Columbia, and the rivers of their birth. Massive runs of salmon head up the Campbell River on Vancouver Island to their freshwater spawning grounds, including Coho, Steelhead, Chum, Chinook and Pink salmon. Viewing this natural spectacle from river banks is a wonderful experience, but the migrating salmon can be viewed in a whole different light by snorkelling on the Campbell River.  Snorkeling in the Campbell River allows swimming with salmon in their natural habitat as they swim upstream toward the gravel spawning beds. A vital spawning stream, the Campbell River drains 1,460 square kilometres in its journey from Vancouver Island\u2019s rugged interior mountains to where it empties into Discovery Passage. The bottom of the river is rocky, with depths of up to 3 metres (10 feet) in the deeper parts, allowing for easier and unobstructed floating.  To protect the shallow gravel spawning beds and avoid disturbing the spawning salmon, snorkelers enter the river below the Quinsam River. The preferred put-in spot at the logging bridge on the Gold River Highway 28 allows easy and safe access to the water from a sandy shoreline and a slow-moving pool.  Take out is at the end of Maple Street, behind the Quinsam Hotel, or a slow moving deep water tidal pool in the estuary, which is often visited by harbour seals looking for easy prey as salmon get trapped following the tides in and out of the river. The huge rocks that mark the banks of the river make exiting easy.  Wet suits are recommended, as the Campbell River isn\u2019t really warm, and the additional flotation enables the snorkeler to float high in the water and be carried over and around obstacles. Lying quietly in the water and drifting with the current will not bother the salmon, and more fish will be seen \u2013 splashing and diving will scare them away. Snorkeling is best on sunny days, when the fish are more spectacular in the bright sunlight, with their colouring bright and shining. Trout and crayfish can also be seen.  Types of Salmon  Chinook Salmon (Spring, King, Blackmouth or Tyee). The most-sought-after sport salmon, they reside in the deep ocean for 4 to 7 years before returning to their birth river. A Tyee is a Chinook salmon greater than 30 pounds (14 kilograms). The size range is 5-30+ pounds with many mid-twenties being common June through August.  Coho Salmon (Silvers). Start arriving in June. Hard-hitting acrobat that range in size from 4-20 pounds.  Sockeye Salmon (Red Salmon). Spawn in lakes and small feeder streams. Their young live in lakes for a year or more before making their way to the open ocean and are mostly plankton feeders. Prized for their bright red flesh and are commercially the most valuable Pacific salmon. They range in size from 5-12 pounds and can occasionally exceed 15 pounds.  Pink Salmon (\u201cHumpies\u201d). Arrive in large numbers and on odd-numbered years (eg. 2017 or 2019) they migrate in the millions. They are the smallest Pacific salmon, averaging 3.5 pounds (1.6 kilograms) to 5 pounds (2.1 kilograms) and can reach 12+ pounds.  Chum Salmon (\u201cDogs\u201d, Keta, or Calico)\/ Second largest and the latest salmon to arrive in Campbell River - start in August and peak throughout October. Toughest fighting salmon and average 8-20 pounds.    Horn Lakes Cave. Open 9:30-5:30. Two options of tours: Multicave Explorer $79, Riverbend Cave $54.  Horne Hustle  Englishman River Falls PP  3kms hiking including spectacular loop along the river and beside a canyon to viewpoints near two great waterfalls.  Access: From Highway 19, take the Port Alberni turnoff (exit 51) to Highway 4A. 3kms to turn to park at Errington Road, then 8kms on Errington Road to park.  Coombs. Old Country Store and goats on roof. Stop at this great specialty product store.  Little Qualicum Falls PP  Follow a loop around the lower and upper falls on good wide trails. Take two viewpoint trails to see each waterfall from its best perspective. Follow close to the fence lines.  Best in the spring and after big rains. The gorge itself is mediocre and the upper falls the better of the two. This loop takes only 45 minutes. The other several kilometres of trail service the large camp grounds.  The forest is mainly second growth with only a few large broken off trees. Large arbutus trees (the only evergreen broadleaf tree in Canada) are randomly distributed through the forest.  Access: From Highway 19, turn onto Port Alberni highway 4 for 9kms to entrance, 1.3kms to parking lot.  Camp Night 1 at Mt Cokely parking area.    Climb Mt Cokely (5301\u2019). A satellite peak of Mt Arrowsmith and the mountain of the old\u00a0 Arrowsmith Ski Hill, views from the top include Georgia Strait to the east and Port Alberni to the west.  Drive: Access old ski hill access road. Turn left (south) off Hwy 4 just west of the Alberni Summit. Turn left on the far side of a bridge and drive up the valley back over the Cameron River, take left fork up steep road onto Pass Main. Continue up switchbacks to a hairpin turn. Drive up the valley turning left at saddle between Mt Cokely and Arrowsmith, through the gate and park at the ski area. Climb runs up the NW ridge.    Cathedral Grove  In 1944, the forester HR MacMillan donated this land to the province. Since it has become one of the most beautiful spots in Canada, and draws approximately half a million visitors annually. 132-hectare grove of giant Douglas fir, many over 800 years old (largest 9m circumference) and Western Red cedar. In MacMillan PP. A 1997 wind storm blew over hundreds of trees.  Logging has come right to the border of the park, removing the natural wind barrier. Global warming will dry out this area, placing stress on the cedars and hemlocks.\u00a0 The park\u2019s small size and accessibility has left it vulnerable to impacts from high visitor use.  Camp Night 2. Drive To Carmanah Valley and camp.    CARMANAH WALBRAN trails. (Map 8\/E6). Carmanah Walbran PP and Pacific Rim NP  Carmanah Provincial Park were created in 1990 to protect the lower Carmanah Valley. In 1995, after years of logging blockades and protests, the upper Carmanah and lower Walbran were added to form Carmanah Walbran PP. The park offers protection to diverse forest ecosystems, including a large Sitka spruce ecosystem that represents 2% of BC\u2019s remaining old-growth forest.  The spruce groves in the park are about twice as dense in biomass as a tropical forest. 36 bird species including the marbled murelett (Carmanah Valley was the first place to record marbled murelett nests.  The central Walbran was designated a special management zone (environmental, cultural, and recreational values at core of harvesting plans; require more old growth retention and smaller cut blocks; \u201cold growth logging by another name\u201d). In 2014, flagging tape was found at the unprotected Castle Grove (Surrey based Teal-Jones Group). Trees already logged to build roads. It is contiguous with the provincial park, but its trees are spectacular in size, abundance and structure.  Carmanah Walbran is home to some of the world\u2019s largest spruce trees, some reaching heights in excess of 95 metres and living for 800 years or more. The park is also home to ancient, gnarled cedars \u2013 estimated to be well over 1,000 years old \u2013 clinging to the side hills. Nestled beneath these awe-inspiring trees is a diverse variety of flora and fauna possible only in an ecosystem that has remained undisturbed for hundreds of years.  Sitka spruce forests are typically coast-hugging \u2013 they are rarely found more than 80 kilometres inland and at elevations greater than 30 metres. The park\u2019s extensive groves of spruce attain a biomass (weight of plants per hectare) that is nearly twice that of a tropical forest.  The park is a wilderness area. Trails are primitive and very muddy. Carmanah Walbran has no gas, food, roofed lodging, telephone or medical services. Gas, food and telephone service are available at the Didtidaht Nation Centre located in Nitinat, approximately 20 km from the park. The primary destination point of visitors to the park is the Park Facility Operator\u2019s station, located at the lower Carmanah Valley Trailhead. This area offers parking, pit toilets and walk-in camping above the valley.  National Topographic Series map number 92, sheets C\/10 and C\/15 cover the Carmanah Valley area.  Drive: There are three different routes leading to the Caycuse River Bridge, which is the only way to access the park.  1. From Port Alberni follow the Bamfield Road for approximately 40 km to the Franklin River Junction, turn left onto South Main and proceed eastward, past the logging camp buildings and toward Nitinat Lake. Continue on South Main for approximately 23 km to the Nitinat River Bridge. Stay on South Main until reaching the Caycuse River Bridge.  2. From Port Renfrew follow the Lake Cowichan Connector Road north to Honeymoon Bay. At Honeymoon Bay, turn left and proceed along South Shore Road, which becomes Nitinat Main, continuing to the junction of Nitinat Main and South Main. Turn left onto South Main and proceed to the Caycuse River Bridge.  3. Via Lake Cowichan follow South Shore Road past\u00a0Gordon Bay Provincial Park\u00a0to the Nitinat Main, or follow the North Shore Road through Youbou to the Nitinat Main. Continue along Nitinat Main till it connects with Junction South. Turn left onto South Main and proceed to the Caycuse River Bridge.  Once you have crossed the Caycuse River Bridge, turn right immediately and proceed on Rosander Main for approximately 29 km to the park.  From SE corner of\u00a0Port Alberni\u00a0&gt; Franklin River Rd\/Bamfield Main &gt; Carmanah Main &gt; Rosanger Main (on south side of Nitinat Lake)    Cheewhat Lake Cedar\u00a0(Cheewaht Giant) (Map 8\/C7)  Canada\u2019s largest tree, world\u2019s largest Western Red cedar: 18.34m (60.2\u2019) circumference, 55.5m (182\u2019) high.  There are bigger trees in the world, but the Cheewaht Giant is the Big Doodah, the Numero Uno, the Colossus of trees in Canada. Located off a series of unpaved logging roads southeast of Port Alberni, the humungous red cedar was found in 1988 by Maywell Wickheim who\u2019d spent his life searching for the country\u2019s biggest tree.  Cheewhat Lake is tucked into the southern portion of Pacific Rim National Park Reserve.  The lake is largely trail-less but a few of the largest trees grow on the eastern end and can be accessed by the short Cheewhat Lake Cedar Trail. The trailhead is very easy to miss unless you know to look for it. There are a few bits of flagging tape on both sides of the road and a small cairn to mark the entrance.  Rosander Mainline will traverse the hillside above the east shore of Nitinat Lake, climbs steeply, then drops into the Marchand Creek valley. The road winds down into the valley, then after several bridges rises gently. After a wide clearing the road enters a logged area. Park safely off the road at the first widening of the road on the right after entering the clear cut. Nearby a rough, overgrown track leads down into the clear cut.  Follow this track down and across the slash. As the track rises slightly and bears left along the edge of the old-growth forest that marks the boundary of Pacific Rim National Park Reserve, look for a huge cedar stump 4.6m (15ft) across. Ring counts of this stump totaled 968 years. Another stump nearby has 1212 intact annual rings, plus it has a hollow center - this tree could have been as old as 1400 years when it was cut down.  The Cheewhat Lake trail is roughly marked with flagging, but it is easy to lose ones way here. The trail begins near an area of blow down along the park boundary, and the initial start to the trail is obscured with fallen trees. After carefully negotiating your way over, under, and around the downed trees, the trail will descend to the right through the blow down. Pick up the trail again at a flat covered with ferns and huge cedars. The largest tree in this grove is over 4.6m (15ft.) thick, but the grove itself has been affected by more blow down due to inadequate park buffer zones. Beyond this grove carefully follow the vague and poorly marked trail. It heads to the right over a low ridge, then doubles back to the left along a bench land through dense salal and cedar-hemlock rain forest. The trail will turn downhill and passes two Western red cedars growing by each other. The bigger of the two is 5.5m (18ft.) in diameter.  A short distance downhill and left you will find the awe-inspiring pinnacle of The Cheewhat Lake Cedar. This champion tree is 6.0m (19.7ft) in diameter, circumference of at least 18.34 meters (60 feet)\u00a0and 59m (194ft) tall. The tree has 450 cubic meters of timber volume. Nearby are many other large cedars scattered through the original, wild forest.      Using a hollow auger on a nearby fallen cedar, and extrapolating from that core\u2019s tree-ring count to the Cheewaht Giant\u2019s diameter, it is calculated to be 3,500 years old. The small grove near the Cheewhat Lake Cedar is perhaps the most striking with several redwood-sized specimens.    Cheewhat Lake  There is another giant tree, the third largest tree and north of the lake. The trailhead is even harder to find. Take Roseander Main north, turn left towards Doobah Lake on logging road T23B a few kilometres to a barely flagged entrance. The rough trail leads to the north Cheewhat shore but to reach the tree, you need to bushwhack slightly east. This definitely primordial-looking western red cedar is likely a result of fusion between two independently huge trees hundreds of years ago.    CARMANAH WALBRAN PP  Road access (Rosander Main) to the lower Carmanah Valley is currently open\u00a0and very rough but not guaranteed, please note that alder growth just prior to the park entrance is causing the road to be brushed in, but is passable. Flat tires are common so have an electric pump, spares and preferably 10-ply tires.\u00a0  Carmanah Giant is a 95m (312\u2019) high, the tallest known tree in Canada and believed to be the third tallest Sitka spruce, 31\u2019 circumference. Estimated to be less than 400 years old, it is the tallest known Sitka Spruce in the world. Surrounded by 90m (280\u2019) spruce and thousand-year-old cedars. Growing in a ravine near the bottom of the lower Carmanah Trail, which is officially closed.  Carmanah Creek.\u00a0A variety of viewpoints can be reached from the main trail, which leads up and down Carmanah Creek from the Carmanah Valley Trailhead. The whole Carmanah Valley is 20km long and difficult as the trail is not maintained.  TH at parking lot \u2013 trail switchbacks steeply down to the valley floor and the Carmanah Creek junction at 1.3km. Just before the junction is the Coast Tower. 25 min one way.  Coast Tower: 1.2 km, 20 minutes. A massive Sitka spruce used to be 92 metres in height until the top 30 metres blew off in winter storms in 1997.  Junction: 1.3 km, 25 minutes. Turn left to go to the Upper Valley Trail, which heads toward Three Sisters, Grunts Grove, Paradise Pool and August Creek. Turn right to head downstream toward Heaven Tree and the Randy Stoltmann Commemorative Grove.  Upstream (distances are from the Carmanah Creek junction 1.3kms from parking lot)  \u2022\u00a0Three Sisters Grove:\u00a0One of the trees fell naturally during the winter of 2018\/19. 70 minutes upstream from the Junction. An elevated viewing platform gives a unique perspective of three breathtaking Sitka spruce trees, all growing from the same spot. These trees are approximately 78-79m high. Wilderness camping is allowed here on the large sandbar beside Carmanah Creek. Pit toilets. The boardwalk portions of the trail end after Three Sisters.  \u2022\u00a0Grunt\u2019s Grove: 4 km and 1.5km above Three Sisters. 1.25 hours from the Junction. Majestic stand of Sitka spruce with adjacent camping on gravel bars. Spruce seedlings typically start their life on the sandbars in Carmanah.  \u2022\u00a0Paradise Pool:\u00a05 km. 2 hours from the Junction. Paradise Pool is a small crystal clear pool with tiny Cutthroat trout and crayfish. Cougar tracks can often be seen in the mud. Too cold to swim.  \u2022\u00a0August Creek:\u00a07.5 km. 3.5 hours from the Junction. August Creek is a small intact watershed that flows into Carmanah from a high reverse valley. It is the largest creek that flows into Carmanah. Backcountry camping opportunities exist on the sandbar just downstream of the confluence of August and Carmanah Creek. There are no pit toilets here. This is the most upstream campsite in the valley; maintained trails end at August Creek.  \u2022Walbran Falls: 15 minutes upriver. Tiered waterfalls and good swimming pools.  Downstream  \u2022\u00a0Heaven Tree: 0 km, 30 minutes downstream from the Junction. Sitka spruce 77m tall, diameter of 3.5m, one of the broadest spruce trees  \u2022\u00a0Randy Stoltmann Commemorative Grove:3 km. 50 minutes downstream from the Junction. 75 \u2013 89 metres in height. These trees all compete for light and are growing tall as they reach for the sun. The terminus of the downstream trail. Closed for public safety reasons. No trail connection to the West Coast Trail.    Wilderness camping is allowed at several locations upstream from The Three Sisters in the Carmanah Valley, with walk-in camping available above the Valley where the Carmanah Valley Trailhead is located.  Camping is also permitted during the summer months in the valley on the Carmanah Creek\u2019s exposed gravel bars. Campfires are prohibited here.  Campsites with tent pads, picnic tables and fire rings are provided beyond the parking area on the service road. Short-term vehicle camping is permitted in the parking lot.  A backcountry camping fee is charged at Carmanah Walbran; self registration vaults are located in the parking lot at the Carmanah Valley Trailhead.  Campfires are only allowed in the steel fire rings located in the campsites along the service road and in the area near the Carmanah Valley Trailhead. Campfire time restrictions are in effect: Cooking fires are allowed from 7:00 am \u2013 9:00 am; 11:00 am \u2013 1:00 pm; and 5:00 pm \u2013 7:00 pm; small campfires after 7:00 pm. Campfire rings are provided.    UPPER WALBRAN  Larger and equally interesting. Take a left fork at the Cayuse Bridge. Best access is via McClure Main and Glad Lake Main. Has been logged for years but still much old-growth forest. The bridge on Walbran Creek near the park boundary makes a fine destination for car camping and day trips. Good trails, some with boardwalk, stairs, bridges and gorgeous river-side campsites.  Camping. 1. Best established campsite is at south entrance. 2. Hadiken Lake \u2013 dock, trail around lake, old growth    Emerald Loop Trail is the most accessible and family-friendly hike in the Walbran Valley. Situated parallel to the entry road into the valley, the trail is very short, fairly flat, and takes about 20 minutes to complete through old-growth trees next to the Walbran River.  The trail was first forged in the early 1990s by protesters who dedicated considerable effort to bringing tourism into the area, thereby preventing further logging of the valley trees. As tourists began to arrive, conservationists built the boardwalk to offset the erosive damage heavy foot traffic would cause the forest.  West Walbran Trail\u00a0(Walbran Solidarity Trail). In the park but not a recognized park route. Walk through one of the best diversity of giant trees between two logging road accesses. It is a good day hike (either long or short depending on trail conditions). Gets overgrown. Expect a full day to do the trail end to end about 7kms. Most hike from the south access only.  North Access: near end of Haddon Main. At the Haddon-Walbran junction, stay on Haddon Main heading south for 6kms until junction with an old overgrown spur (second spur on the right, first is overgrown)  Haddons Corner. .5km. very large spruce.  Anderson Lake. mid-point of trail. Good camping, an old burled cedar. Kokanee.  South Access: 14km south the Haddon main junction. Take the last right turn off the main down a deactivated logging bridge that descends to the old and only logging bridge over the Walbran. The trail begins near the Harriet Nahanee Memorial Trail and the Castle Grove Trail , initially penetrating a forest of primarily western red cedar. Some of these giants are over 500 years old and have grown into incredible sizes and shapes with age. Upper Falls. Several tiers over bedrock. Salamanders.  Bridge Over Troubled Walbran. Once crossed by a cable car, then a log bridge, now a shallow placid wade. Trail leads from the end of the bridge along the creek to the main camping area. The transition from western red cedar to Sitka spruce is quite remarkable and unique among the various trails in and around the Walbran Valley.  One of the absolute largest of these spruces is \u201cMaxine\u2019s Tree\u201d, the largest spruce in BC and second largest in Canada at 80.8m high and 12.65m circumference. Further on, near Anderson Lake, the trail becomes a bit harder to follow.  Harriet Nahanee Memorial Trail. Opened in 2016, this trail commemorates the life and conservation efforts of a heroic First Nations woman who was instrumental in preserving both the Carmanah and Walbran rainforest valleys.  Starting by the shores of the Walbran River, the trail initially passes by several huge western red cedars including the \u201cTolkien Giant\u201d before climbing steeply. Its north side journeys through some equally gigantic, yet nameless, cedars that amazingly cling resiliently to the vertical slopes of this elevated hike.  The trail passes through cut blocks proposed by logging companies and hopefully helps raise awareness of the danger these pristine giants face to short-sided industry practices.  Castle Grove &amp; Witness Trail.\u00a0No other trail in Vancouver Island contains a higher concentration of monumental western red cedars than the magical Castle Grove. Located across the West Walbran Creek from the main Walbran Valley entrance, the Grove is situated on a rich alluvial flood plain - a perfect environment for the development of giant trees. The Grove\u2019s largest specimen is an immense red cedar appropriately named \u201cCastle Giant\u201d that has grown to approximately 16 feet in diameter over hundreds of years. About a thousand years old and one of the largest trees in Canada.  On the eastern slopes above the Grove, conservationists have constructed a newer side path called the Witness Trail. Trees as large and tall as ones in Castle Grove are found here as well. Forming a loop up a hill, the path is a definitely thigh burner with an early near vertical ascent no matter which direction you approach it. Like the Harriet Nahanee Memorial Trail, the route was strategically located to take hikers across proposed cutblocks by timber companies, helping draw attention to potentially devastating losses and encourage tourism over logging as the Walbran Valley\u2019s main economic driver.  Central Walbran: An arm of the trail goes to the Central Walbran to two lakes Botley and Auger Lakes    Drive from Walbran via Shawnigan Lake.    Kinsol Trestle. Shawnigan Lake  Drive: Public vehicle access is from Shawnigan Lake to the south end of the trestle. From Shawnigan Lake Road in the town turn north onto Renfrew Road. Follow it past the end of the Lake to Gleneagles Road and turn right. There is a public parking area about 550 metres down the road on the right hand side.  On Foot:\u00a0From the parking lot on the south side, the Kinsol Trestle is approximately 1.2 km in distance on the Cowichan Valley Trail which is located on the old railway grade. The trail is wheelchair accessible and is flat, wide, and surfaced with crushed gravel fines. There are accessible toilet facilities at the parking lot and on the north side of the Kinsol Trestle that are open year round. The Cowichan Valley Trail is used to access the Kinsol Trestle from the north which is open for cyclists, hikers and equestrians.    Chemainus Murals After more than 120 years, the sawmill shut down in 1983 and from just five murals in 1982, there are now 44 huge depictions of the community\u2019s history in an open-air museum.  As a direct result, Chemainus has attracted numerous new businesses, many thousands of visitors a year, a $3.5 million dinner theatre and a first-class hotel. From a dependence on a single industry, it has broadened its economic base to offer a range of services and tourist related activities. To everyone\u2019s relief, the mill was rebuilt and modernized, and reopened in 1985. By that time, residents and visitors alike felt that they had proven they could survive the worst of times through their spirit and determination.    AROUND NANAIMO  Petroglyph Provincial Park, Nanaimo. The high concentration of prehistoric rock carvings is the main attraction here, located at the south end of Nanaimo just off Hwy 1. Dating from more than 1,000 years ago, the images \u2013 depicting everything from mystical wolf-like creatures to fish and human figures \u2013 were made for a variety of reasons, including territorial ownership and to commemorate special events among a people with no written language. The sandstone gallery of petroglyphs, located on a hill overlooking Nanaimo Harbour, is just a short distance from the interpretive area along the walkway.  Concrete replica castings of the petroglyphs can be found in the main interpretation area. Here, visitors can make rubbings of the castings by stretching cloth or paper across the carving and lightly rubbing with a crayon, charcoal or wax, which leaves a reverse imprint. These rubbings make a great souvenir of a visit to this intriguing and educational park.  Mt Benson  Malaspina Galleries, Gabriola Island.\u00a0This isn\u2019t your typical art gallery. Less than 10 minutes from the ferry terminal, these galleries show what a gorgeous art form nature can display. From years of stormy waters crashing on the sandstone along with freezing and warming temperatures, nature has created its own on-land rip curl. This impressive carving has the form of a barreling wave and is truly fascinating to see. It is a wonderfully visual way to appreciate the sheer power of water.  Wavelike formations exist all over the Gulf Islands, but these are the most well known. These are by many accounts the most impressive at 100m long, ideal because they are also the most accessible. The wave is nearly 4m tall, which means you can easily walk under it and observe the finer details of the rock structure.    Malaspina Galleries is a cool spot to explore no matter the time of day - sunsets and how the light changes on the rock formations.\u00a0Bring snacks and water and enjoy spreading out on the massive smooth rocks and simply\u00a0relax and soak in the island life.  Moorecroft Regional Park, Nanoose Bay, a 34-hectare park featuring Western Red Cedar, Douglas Fir, twisted Arbutus trees, and endangered Garry Oak. If that's not enough, add in a hike to\u00a0The Notch, and end the day with a pint at a destination English pub - The Rocking Horse Pub.  From the Petro Canada gas station turn off the Island Highway (Highway 19) onto Northwest Bay Road. Turn right onto Powder Point Road and continue until you reach a four way stop. Continue straight as Powder Point Road then becomes Fairwinds Road. Look for the trail head on the right hand side of the road.    PARKSVILLE   Boardwalk  Rathtrevor Beach Provincial Park\u00a0is one of the province's most popular family destinations. Rathtrevor Beach is home to\u00a0many resorts (along Resort Drive)\u00a0and to the BC Provincial Park \/ Campground of the same name. The attractions include sea (five kilometers of beachfront), forest (complete with a circular, oceanfront trail) and parkland (including shaded picnic grounds and lots of space to knock a ball around). At low tide, the ocean recedes almost a kilometre back from Rathtrevor's shoreline.  The Rathtrevor Beach Nature House is an\u00a0interpretive centre and hub for environmental education.  As a Mountain Bike Park, the park is part of an off-road route that links the provincial park and resorts with a popular walking and swimming area on the Englishman River. Round trip distance from Rathtrevor is 10km.  Sand sculpting Festival.\u00a0The\u00a0Quality Foods Sand Sculpting Competition and Exhibition\u00a0is a world class event for Master Sand Sculptors and is an official qualifying event for the World Championship of Sand Sculpting. Master Sand Sculptors travel from all corners of the globe to participate. Sculptors have 30 hours over four days to create their masterpieces from just sand and water. Well over 100,000 people visit during the festival.  St Anne\u2019s Anglican Church, Parksville. The pretty and beloved St. Anne\u2019s Anglican Church in Parksville is one of Vancouver Island\u2019s oldest churches (and the oldest surviving log church) built in 1894. Gravestones honour many new settlers who helped in its construction. St. Anne\u2019s still has an active parish, though they use nearby St. Edmund\u2019s for some services. Parish records show that the church\u2019s first baptism was for Emily Jane Hume, daughter of Robert Hume and Charlot Emily Hickey, on August 12, 1894. The first wedding united Irish Catholic Thomas Kinkade and Sarah Coqulamat, a coastal First Nations widow, on October 24, 1896.  If you get the chance to visit St. Anne\u2019s, it is a wonderful weathered log building. The stone font was donated by Mrs. Cooper in 1921 in memory of her husband Rev. Canon Charles Cooper. He first initiated the building of the church in 1893 \u2013 at the time there was no place of worship between Nanaimo and Alberni. The east window was a gift from E.B. May in 1938, in memory of his wife, Dorothy May.  Visit the gravestone of \u201cbaby Christina\u201d - Christina Morison passed away at just 6 weeks old in July of 1897. Many graves have a plasticized write up telling the story of the inhabitant.    Monks Art Gallery.    Qualicum Beach Heritage Forest. 5 minutes from downtown Qualicum Beach are 50 acres of rare old growth forest \u2013 a mixture of Coastal Douglas Fir, Western Red Cedar, Hemlock, Grand Fir and Sitka Spruce.\u00a0The park is centred on a lush ravine with a salmon stream. There are few truly large trees but it makes for a pleasant walk in the middle of a town.    NEARBY HIKES  HORNBY ISLAND\u00a0  1. Mt. Geoffrey.

Massive runs of salmon head up the Campbell River on Vancouver Island to their freshwater spawning grounds, including Coho, Steelhead, Chum, Chinook and Pink salmon. Viewing this natural spectacle from river banks is a wonderful experience, but the migrating salmon can be viewed in a whole different light by snorkelling on the Campbell River.<br /> Snorkeling in the Campbell River allows swimming with salmon in their natural habitat as they swim upstream toward the gravel spawning beds. A vital spawning stream, the Campbell River drains 1,460 square kilometres in its journey from Vancouver Island’s rugged interior mountains to where it empties into Discovery Passage. The bottom of the river is rocky, with depths of up to 3 metres (10 feet) in the deeper parts, allowing for easier and unobstructed floating.<br /> To protect the shallow gravel spawning beds and avoid disturbing the spawning salmon, snorkelers enter the river below the Quinsam River. The preferred put-in spot at the logging bridge on the Gold River Highway 28 allows easy and safe access to the water from a sandy shoreline and a slow-moving pool.<br /> Take out is at the end of Maple Street, behind the Quinsam Hotel, or a slow moving deep water tidal pool in the estuary, which is often visited by harbour seals looking for easy prey as salmon get trapped following the tides in and out of the river. The huge rocks that mark the banks of the river make exiting easy.<br /> Wet suits are recommended, as the Campbell River isn’t really warm, and the additional flotation enables the snorkeler to float high in the water and be carried over and around obstacles. Lying quietly in the water and drifting with the current will not bother the salmon, and more fish will be seen – splashing and diving will scare them away. Snorkeling is best on sunny days, when the fish are more spectacular in the bright sunlight, with their colouring bright and shining. Trout and crayfish can also be seen.<br /> <strong>Types of Salmon</strong><br /> <em>Chinook Salmon</em> (Spring, King, Blackmouth or Tyee). The most-sought-after sport salmon, they reside in the deep ocean for 4 to 7 years before returning to their birth river. A Tyee is a Chinook salmon greater than 30 pounds (14 kilograms). The size range is 5-30+ pounds with many mid-twenties being common June through August.<br /> <em>Coho Salmon</em> (Silvers). Start arriving in June. Hard-hitting acrobat that range in size from 4-20 pounds.<br /> <em>Sockeye Salmon</em> (Red Salmon). Spawn in lakes and small feeder streams. Their young live in lakes for a year or more before making their way to the open ocean and are mostly plankton feeders. Prized for their bright red flesh and are commercially the most valuable Pacific salmon. They range in size from 5-12 pounds and can occasionally exceed 15 pounds.<br /> <em>Pink Salmon</em> (“Humpies”). Arrive in large numbers and on odd-numbered years (eg. 2017 or 2019) they migrate in the millions. They are the smallest Pacific salmon, averaging 3.5 pounds (1.6 kilograms) to 5 pounds (2.1 kilograms) and can reach 12+ pounds.<br /> <em>Chum Salmon</em> (“Dogs”, Keta, or Calico)/ Second largest and the latest salmon to arrive in Campbell River &#8211; start in August and peak throughout October. Toughest fighting salmon and average 8-20 pounds.</p><p><strong>Horn Lakes Cave.</strong> Open 9:30-5:30.

Global warming will dry out this area, placing stress on the cedars and hemlocks.  The park’s small size and accessibility has left it vulnerable to impacts from high visitor use.<br /> <strong><em>Camp Night 2.</em></strong><em> Drive To Carmanah Valley and camp.</em></p><p><strong>CARMANAH WALBRAN </strong>trails. (Map 8/E6). Carmanah Walbran PP and Pacific Rim NP<br /> Carmanah Provincial Park were created in 1990 to protect the lower Carmanah Valley. In 1995, after years of logging blockades and protests, the upper Carmanah and lower Walbran were added to form Carmanah Walbran PP. The park offers protection to diverse forest ecosystems, including a large Sitka spruce ecosystem that represents 2% of BC’s remaining old-growth forest.<br /> The spruce groves in the park are about twice as dense in biomass as a tropical forest. 36 bird species including the marbled murelett (Carmanah Valley was the first place to record marbled murelett nests.<br /> The central Walbran was designated a special management zone (environmental, cultural, and recreational values at core of harvesting plans; require more old growth retention and smaller cut blocks; “old growth logging by another name”). In 2014, flagging tape was found at the unprotected Castle Grove (Surrey based Teal-Jones Group). Trees already logged to build roads. It is contiguous with the provincial park, but its trees are spectacular in size, abundance and structure.<br /> Carmanah Walbran is home to some of the world’s largest spruce trees, some reaching heights in excess of 95 metres and living for 800 years or more. The park is also home to ancient, gnarled cedars – estimated to be well over 1,000 years old – clinging to the side hills. Nestled beneath these awe-inspiring trees is a diverse variety of flora and fauna possible only in an ecosystem that has remained undisturbed for hundreds of years.<br /> Sitka spruce forests are typically coast-hugging – they are rarely found more than 80 kilometres inland and at elevations greater than 30 metres. The park’s extensive groves of spruce attain a biomass (weight of plants per hectare) that is nearly twice that of a tropical forest.<br /> The park is a wilderness area. Trails are primitive and very muddy. Carmanah Walbran has no gas, food, roofed lodging, telephone or medical services. Gas, food and telephone service are available at the Didtidaht Nation Centre located in Nitinat, approximately 20 km from the park. The primary destination point of visitors to the park is the Park Facility Operator’s station, located at the lower Carmanah Valley Trailhead. This area offers parking, pit toilets and walk-in camping above the valley.<br /> National Topographic Series map number 92, sheets C/10 and C/15 cover the Carmanah Valley area.<br /> <strong>Drive:</strong> There are three different routes leading to the Caycuse River Bridge, which is the only way to access the park.<br /> 1. From Port Alberni follow the Bamfield Road for approximately 40 km to the Franklin River Junction, turn left onto South Main and proceed eastward, past the logging camp buildings and toward Nitinat Lake. Continue on South Main for approximately 23 km to the Nitinat River Bridge. Stay on South Main until reaching the Caycuse River Bridge.<br /> 2. From Port Renfrew follow the Lake Cowichan Connector Road north to Honeymoon Bay. At Honeymoon Bay, turn left and proceed along South Shore Road, which becomes Nitinat Main, continuing to the junction of Nitinat Main and South Main. Turn left onto South Main and proceed to the Caycuse River Bridge.<br /> 3. Via Lake Cowichan follow South Shore Road past Gordon Bay Provincial Park to the Nitinat Main, or follow the North Shore Road through Youbou to the Nitinat Main. Continue along Nitinat Main till it connects with Junction South. Turn left onto South Main and proceed to the Caycuse River Bridge.<br /> Once you have crossed the Caycuse River Bridge, turn right immediately and proceed on Rosander Main for approximately 29 km to the park.<br /> From SE corner of <u>Port Alberni</u> &gt; Franklin River Rd/Bamfield Main &gt; Carmanah Main &gt; Rosanger Main (on south side of Nitinat Lake)<br /> <strong><br /> Cheewhat Lake Cedar </strong>(Cheewaht Giant) (Map 8/C7)<br /> Canada’s largest tree, world’s largest Western Red cedar: 18.34m (60.2’) circumference, 55.5m (182’) high.<br /> There are bigger trees in the world, but the Cheewaht Giant is the Big Doodah, the Numero Uno, the Colossus of trees in Canada. Located off a series of unpaved logging roads southeast of Port Alberni, the humungous red cedar was found in 1988 by Maywell Wickheim who’d spent his life searching for the country’s biggest tree.<a style="font-size: 12px;" title="Cheewhat Lake, Vancouver Island" href="http://www.nwhikers.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=8030912#&amp;pid=49082146547" target="_blank" rel="noopener" name="0" data-pid="49082146547" data-c="" data-vr=""><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="pic_thumb" src="http://www.nwhikers.org/forums/uploads/1e/f3/49082146547_360x240.jpg" alt="Cheewhat Lake, Vancouver Island" width="360" height="240" border="0" /></a><br /> Cheewhat Lake is tucked into the southern portion of Pacific Rim National Park Reserve.<br /> The lake is largely trail-less but a few of the largest trees grow on the eastern end and can be accessed by the short Cheewhat Lake Cedar Trail. The trailhead is very easy to miss unless you know to look for it. There are a few bits of flagging tape on both sides of the road and a small cairn to mark the entrance.<br /> Rosander Mainline will traverse the hillside above the east shore of Nitinat Lake, climbs steeply, then drops into the Marchand Creek valley. The road winds down into the valley, then after several bridges rises gently. After a wide clearing the road enters a logged area. Park safely off the road at the first widening of the road on the right after entering the clear cut. Nearby a rough, overgrown track leads down into the clear cut.<br /> Follow this track down and across the slash. As the track rises slightly and bears left along the edge of the old-growth forest that marks the boundary of Pacific Rim National Park Reserve, look for a huge cedar stump 4.6m (15ft) across. Ring counts of this stump totaled 968 years. Another stump nearby has 1212 intact annual rings, plus it has a hollow center &#8211; this tree could have been as old as 1400 years when it was cut down.<br /> The Cheewhat Lake trail is roughly marked with flagging, but it is easy to lose ones way here. The trail begins near an area of blow down along the park boundary, and the initial start to the trail is obscured with fallen trees. After carefully negotiating your way over, under, and around the downed trees, the trail will descend to the right through the blow down. Pick up the trail again at a flat covered with ferns and huge cedars. The largest tree in this grove is over 4.6m (15ft.) thick, but the grove itself has been affected by more blow down due to inadequate park buffer zones. Beyond this grove carefully follow the vague and poorly marked trail. It heads to the right over a low ridge, then doubles back to the left along a bench land through dense salal and cedar-hemlock rain forest. The trail will turn downhill and passes two Western red cedars growing by each other. The bigger of the two is 5.5m (18ft.) in diameter.<br /> A short distance downhill and left you will find the awe-inspiring pinnacle of The Cheewhat Lake Cedar. This champion tree is 6.0m (19.7ft) in diameter, circumference of at least 18.34 meters (60 feet) and 59m (194ft) tall. The tree has 450 cubic meters of timber volume. Nearby are many other large cedars scattered through the original, wild forest.</p><p><a style="font-size: 12px;" title="Cheewhat Lake, Vancouver Island" href="http://www.nwhikers.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=8030912#&amp;pid=49081936851" target="_blank" rel="noopener" name="1" data-pid="49081936851" data-c="" data-vr=""><noscript><img decoding="async" class="pic_thumb" src="http://www.nwhikers.org/forums/uploads/eb/d3/49081936851_360x240.jpg" alt="Cheewhat Lake, Vancouver Island" width="360" height="240" border="0" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload pic_thumb" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20360%20240%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="http://www.nwhikers.org/forums/uploads/eb/d3/49081936851_360x240.jpg" alt="Cheewhat Lake, Vancouver Island" width="360" height="240" border="0" /></a><br /> Using a hollow auger on a nearby fallen cedar, and extrapolating from that core’s tree-ring count to the Cheewaht Giant’s diameter, it is calculated to be 3,500 years old.

The trailhead is even harder to find. Take Roseander Main north, turn left towards Doobah Lake on logging road T23B a few kilometres to a barely flagged entrance. The rough trail leads to the north Cheewhat shore but to reach the tree, you need to bushwhack slightly east. This definitely primordial-looking western red cedar is likely a result of fusion between two independently huge trees hundreds of years ago.</p><p><strong>CARMANAH WALBRAN PP<br /> </strong><em>Road access</em> (Rosander Main) to the lower Carmanah Valley is currently open and very rough but not guaranteed, please note that alder growth just prior to the park entrance is causing the road to be brushed in, but is passable. Flat tires are common so have an electric pump, spares and preferably 10-ply tires. <strong><br /> </strong><strong>Carmanah Giant</strong> is a 95m (312’) high, the tallest known tree in Canada and believed to be the third tallest Sitka spruce, 31’ circumference. Estimated to be less than 400 years old, it is the tallest known Sitka Spruce in the world. Surrounded by 90m (280’) spruce and thousand-year-old cedars. Growing in a ravine near the bottom of the lower Carmanah Trail, which is officially closed.<br /> <strong>Carmanah Creek. </strong>A variety of viewpoints can be reached from the main trail, which leads up and down Carmanah Creek from the Carmanah Valley Trailhead. The whole Carmanah Valley is 20km long and difficult as the trail is not maintained.<br /> TH at parking lot – trail switchbacks steeply down to the valley floor and the Carmanah Creek junction at 1.3km. Just before the junction is the Coast Tower. 25 min one way.<br /> <strong>Coast Tower:</strong> 1.2 km, 20 minutes. A massive Sitka spruce used to be 92 metres in height until the top 30 metres blew off in winter storms in 1997.<br /> <em><strong>Junction:</strong></em> 1.3 km, 25 minutes. Turn left to go to the Upper Valley Trail, which heads toward Three Sisters, Grunts Grove, Paradise Pool and August Creek. Turn right to head downstream toward Heaven Tree and the Randy Stoltmann Commemorative Grove.<br /> <em><strong>Upstream </strong></em>(distances are from the Carmanah Creek junction 1.3kms from parking lot)<br /> • <strong>Three Sisters Grove: </strong>One of the trees fell naturally during the winter of 2018/19. 70 minutes upstream from the Junction. An elevated viewing platform gives a unique perspective of three breathtaking Sitka spruce trees, all growing from the same spot. These trees are approximately 78-79m high. Wilderness camping is allowed here on the large sandbar beside Carmanah Creek. Pit toilets. The boardwalk portions of the trail end after Three Sisters.<br /> • <strong>Grunt’s Grove:</strong> 4 km and 1.5km above Three Sisters. 1.25 hours from the Junction. Majestic stand of Sitka spruce with adjacent camping on gravel bars. Spruce seedlings typically start their life on the sandbars in Carmanah.<br /> • <strong>Paradise Pool: </strong>5 km. 2 hours from the Junction. Paradise Pool is a small crystal clear pool with tiny Cutthroat trout and crayfish. Cougar tracks can often be seen in the mud. Too cold to swim.<br /> • <strong>August Creek:</strong> 7.5 km. 3.5 hours from the Junction. August Creek is a small intact watershed that flows into Carmanah from a high reverse valley. It is the largest creek that flows into Carmanah. Backcountry camping opportunities exist on the sandbar just downstream of the confluence of August and Carmanah Creek. There are no pit toilets here. This is the most upstream campsite in the valley; maintained trails end at August Creek.<br /> •<strong>Walbran Falls:</strong> 15 minutes upriver. Tiered waterfalls and good swimming pools.<br /> <strong><em>Downstream</em><br /> • </strong><strong>Heaven Tree: </strong>0 km, 30 minutes downstream from the Junction. Sitka spruce 77m tall, diameter of 3.5m, one of the broadest spruce trees<br /> • <strong>Randy Stoltmann Commemorative Grove:</strong>3 km. 50 minutes downstream from the Junction. 75 – 89 metres in height. These trees all compete for light and are growing tall as they reach for the sun. The terminus of the downstream trail. Closed for public safety reasons. No trail connection to the West Coast Trail.</p><p><strong>Wilderness camping</strong> is allowed at several locations upstream from The Three Sisters in the Carmanah Valley, with walk-in camping available above the Valley where the Carmanah Valley Trailhead is located.<br /> Camping is also permitted during the summer months in the valley on the Carmanah Creek’s exposed gravel bars. Campfires are prohibited here.<br /> <strong>Campsites</strong> with tent pads, picnic tables and fire rings are provided beyond the parking area on the service road. Short-term vehicle camping is permitted in the parking lot.<br /> A backcountry camping fee is charged at Carmanah Walbran; self registration vaults are located in the parking lot at the Carmanah Valley Trailhead.<br /> Campfires are only allowed in the steel fire rings located in the campsites along the service road and in the area near the Carmanah Valley Trailhead. Campfire time restrictions are in effect: Cooking fires are allowed from 7:00 am – 9:00 am; 11:00 am – 1:00 pm; and 5:00 pm – 7:00 pm; small campfires after 7:00 pm. Campfire rings are provided.</p><p><strong>UPPER WALBRAN<br /> </strong>Larger and equally interesting. Take a left fork at the Cayuse Bridge. Best access is via McClure Main and Glad Lake Main. Has been logged for years but still much old-growth forest. The bridge on Walbran Creek near the park boundary makes a fine destination for car camping and day trips. Good trails, some with boardwalk, stairs, bridges and gorgeous river-side campsites.<br /> <strong>Camping.</strong> 1. Best established campsite is at south entrance. 2. Hadiken Lake – dock, trail around lake, old growth<br /> <strong><br /> Emerald Loop Trail</strong> is the most accessible and family-friendly hike in the Walbran Valley. Situated parallel to the entry road into the valley, the trail is very short, fairly flat, and takes about 20 minutes to complete through old-growth trees next to the Walbran River.<br /> The trail was first forged in the early 1990s by protesters who dedicated considerable effort to bringing tourism into the area, thereby preventing further logging of the valley trees. As tourists began to arrive, conservationists built the boardwalk to offset the erosive damage heavy foot traffic would cause the forest.<br /> <strong>West Walbran Trail </strong>(Walbran Solidarity Trail). In the park but not a recognized park route. Walk through one of the best diversity of giant trees between two logging road accesses. It is a good day hike (either long or short depending on trail conditions). Gets overgrown. Expect a full day to do the trail end to end about 7kms. Most hike from the south access only.<br /> <em>North Access:</em> near end of Haddon Main. At the Haddon-Walbran junction, stay on Haddon Main heading south for 6kms until junction with an old overgrown spur (second spur on the right, first is overgrown)<br /> Haddons Corner. .5km. very large spruce.<br /> Anderson Lake. mid-point of trail. Good camping, an old burled cedar. Kokanee.<br /> <em>South Access:</em> 14km south the Haddon main junction. Take the last right turn off the main down a deactivated logging bridge that descends to the old and only logging bridge over the Walbran. The trail begins near the Harriet Nahanee Memorial Trail and the Castle Grove Trail , initially penetrating a forest of primarily western red cedar. Some of these giants are over 500 years old and have grown into incredible sizes and shapes with age. Upper Falls. Several tiers over bedrock. Salamanders.<br /> Bridge Over Troubled Walbran. Once crossed by a cable car, then a log bridge, now a shallow placid wade. Trail leads from the end of the bridge along the creek to the main camping area. The transition from western red cedar to Sitka spruce is quite remarkable and unique among the various trails in and around the Walbran Valley.<br /> One of the absolute largest of these spruces is “Maxine’s Tree”, the largest spruce in BC and second largest in Canada at 80.8m high and 12.65m circumference. Further on, near Anderson Lake, the trail becomes a bit harder to follow.<br /> <strong>Harriet Nahanee Memorial Trail</strong>. Opened in 2016, this trail commemorates the life and conservation efforts of a heroic First Nations woman who was instrumental in preserving both the Carmanah and Walbran rainforest valleys.<br /> Starting by the shores of the Walbran River, the trail initially passes by several huge western red cedars including the “Tolkien Giant” before climbing steeply. Its north side journeys through some equally gigantic, yet nameless, cedars that amazingly cling resiliently to the vertical slopes of this elevated hike.<br /> The trail passes through cut blocks proposed by logging companies and hopefully helps raise awareness of the danger these pristine giants face to short-sided industry practices.<br /> <strong>Castle Grove &amp; Witness Trail.</strong> No other trail in Vancouver Island contains a higher concentration of monumental western red cedars than the magical Castle Grove. Located across the West Walbran Creek from the main Walbran Valley entrance, the Grove is situated on a rich alluvial flood plain &#8211; a perfect environment for the development of giant trees. The Grove’s largest specimen is an immense red cedar appropriately named “Castle Giant” that has grown to approximately 16 feet in diameter over hundreds of years. About a thousand years old and one of the largest trees in Canada.<br /> On the eastern slopes above the Grove, conservationists have constructed a newer side path called the Witness Trail. Trees as large and tall as ones in Castle Grove are found here as well. Forming a loop up a hill, the path is a definitely thigh burner with an early near vertical ascent no matter which direction you approach it. Like the Harriet Nahanee Memorial Trail, the route was strategically located to take hikers across proposed cutblocks by timber companies, helping draw attention to potentially devastating losses and encourage tourism over logging as the Walbran Valley’s main economic driver.<br /> <strong>Central Walbran: </strong>An arm of the trail goes to the Central Walbran to two lakes Botley and Auger Lakes</p><p><em>Drive from Walbran via Shawnigan Lake.</em></p><p><strong>Kinsol Trestle.</strong> Shawnigan Lake<br /> Drive: Public vehicle access is from Shawnigan Lake to the south end of the trestle. From Shawnigan Lake Road in the town turn north onto Renfrew Road. Follow it past the end of the Lake to Gleneagles Road and turn right. There is a public parking area about 550 metres down the road on the right hand side.<br /> On Foot:<strong> </strong>From the parking lot on the south side, the Kinsol Trestle is approximately 1.2 km in distance on the Cowichan Valley Trail which is located on the old railway grade. The trail is wheelchair accessible and is flat, wide, and surfaced with crushed gravel fines. There are accessible toilet facilities at the parking lot and on the north side of the Kinsol Trestle that are open year round. The Cowichan Valley Trail is used to access the Kinsol Trestle from the north which is open for cyclists, hikers and equestrians.</p><p><strong>Chemainus Murals</strong> After more than 120 years, the sawmill shut down in 1983 and from just five murals in 1982, there are now 44 huge depictions of the community’s history in an open-air museum.<br /> As a direct result, Chemainus has attracted numerous new businesses, many thousands of visitors a year, a $3.5 million dinner theatre and a first-class hotel. From a dependence on a single industry, it has broadened its economic base to offer a range of services and tourist related activities. To everyone’s relief, the mill was rebuilt and modernized, and reopened in 1985. By that time, residents and visitors alike felt that they had proven they could survive the worst of times through their spirit and determination.</p><p><strong>AROUND NANAIMO<br /> </strong><strong>Petroglyph Provincial Park</strong>, Nanaimo. The high concentration of prehistoric rock carvings is the main attraction here, located at the south end of Nanaimo just off Hwy 1. Dating from more than 1,000 years ago, the images – depicting everything from mystical wolf-like creatures to fish and human figures – were made for a variety of reasons, including territorial ownership and to commemorate special events among a people with no written language. The sandstone gallery of petroglyphs, located on a hill overlooking Nanaimo Harbour, is just a short distance from the interpretive area along the walkway.<br /> Concrete replica castings of the petroglyphs can be found in the main interpretation area. Here, visitors can make rubbings of the castings by stretching cloth or paper across the carving and lightly rubbing with a crayon, charcoal or wax, which leaves a reverse imprint. These rubbings make a great souvenir of a visit to this intriguing and educational park.<br /> <strong>Mt Benson</strong><br /> <strong>Malaspina Galleries, Gabriola Island.</strong> This isn’t your typical art gallery. Less than 10 minutes from the ferry terminal, these galleries show what a gorgeous art form nature can display. From years of stormy waters crashing on the sandstone along with freezing and warming temperatures, nature has created its own on-land rip curl. This impressive carving has the form of a barreling wave and is truly fascinating to see. It is a wonderfully visual way to appreciate the sheer power of water.<br /> Wavelike formations exist all over the Gulf Islands, but these are the most well known. These are by many accounts the most impressive at 100m long, ideal because they are also the most accessible. The wave is nearly 4m tall, which means you can easily walk under it and observe the finer details of the rock structure.</p><p><span class="embed-youtube"><iframe loading="lazy" class="youtube-player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zapO-royl8s?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" width="800" height="450" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></span>Malaspina Galleries is a cool spot to explore no matter the time of day &#8211; sunsets and how the light changes on the rock formations. Bring snacks and water and enjoy spreading out on the massive smooth rocks and simply relax and soak in the island life.<br /> <noscript><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6957" src="https://www.travelingislanders.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Malaspina-Galleries-Gabriola-Galleries-2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" srcset="https://www.travelingislanders.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Malaspina-Galleries-Gabriola-Galleries-2.jpg 2000w, https://www.travelingislanders.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Malaspina-Galleries-Gabriola-Galleries-2-500x325.jpg 500w, https://www.travelingislanders.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Malaspina-Galleries-Gabriola-Galleries-2-1200x780.jpg 1200w, https://www.travelingislanders.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Malaspina-Galleries-Gabriola-Galleries-2-860x559.jpg 860w, https://www.travelingislanders.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Malaspina-Galleries-Gabriola-Galleries-2-1024x666.jpg 1024w, https://www.travelingislanders.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Malaspina-Galleries-Gabriola-Galleries-2-300x195.jpg 300w" alt="Gabriola Beaches, Gabriola Island Beaches, Gabriola Galleries, Malaspina Galleries" width="2000" height="1300" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload aligncenter size-full wp-image-6957" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%202000%201300%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://www.travelingislanders.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Malaspina-Galleries-Gabriola-Galleries-2.jpg" data-sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" data-srcset="https://www.travelingislanders.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Malaspina-Galleries-Gabriola-Galleries-2.jpg 2000w, https://www.travelingislanders.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Malaspina-Galleries-Gabriola-Galleries-2-500x325.jpg 500w, https://www.travelingislanders.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Malaspina-Galleries-Gabriola-Galleries-2-1200x780.jpg 1200w, https://www.travelingislanders.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Malaspina-Galleries-Gabriola-Galleries-2-860x559.jpg 860w, https://www.travelingislanders.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Malaspina-Galleries-Gabriola-Galleries-2-1024x666.jpg 1024w, https://www.travelingislanders.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Malaspina-Galleries-Gabriola-Galleries-2-300x195.jpg 300w" alt="Gabriola Beaches, Gabriola Island Beaches, Gabriola Galleries, Malaspina Galleries" width="2000" height="1300" /><strong>Moorecroft Regional Park</strong>, Nanoose Bay, a 34-hectare park featuring Western Red Cedar, Douglas Fir, twisted Arbutus trees, and endangered Garry Oak.

At low tide, the ocean recedes almost a kilometre back from Rathtrevor&#8217;s shoreline.<br /> The Rathtrevor Beach Nature House is an interpretive centre and hub for environmental education.<br /> As a Mountain Bike Park, the park is part of an off-road route that links the provincial park and resorts with a popular walking and swimming area on the Englishman River. Round trip distance from Rathtrevor is 10km.<br /> <strong>Sand sculpting Festival. </strong>The Quality Foods Sand Sculpting Competition and Exhibition is a world class event for Master Sand Sculptors and is an official qualifying event for the World Championship of Sand Sculpting. Master Sand Sculptors travel from all corners of the globe to participate. Sculptors have 30 hours over four days to create their masterpieces from just sand and water. Well over 100,000 people visit during the festival.<br /> <strong>St Anne’s Anglican Church,</strong> Parksville. The pretty and beloved St. Anne’s Anglican Church in Parksville is one of Vancouver Island’s oldest churches (and the oldest surviving log church) built in 1894. Gravestones honour many new settlers who helped in its construction. St. Anne’s still has an active parish, though they use nearby St. Edmund’s for some services. Parish records show that the church’s first baptism was for Emily Jane Hume, daughter of Robert Hume and Charlot Emily Hickey, on August 12, 1894. The first wedding united Irish Catholic Thomas Kinkade and Sarah Coqulamat, a coastal First Nations widow, on October 24, 1896.<br /> If you get the chance to visit St. Anne’s, it is a wonderful weathered log building. The stone font was donated by Mrs. Cooper in 1921 in memory of her husband Rev. Canon Charles Cooper. He first initiated the building of the church in 1893 – at the time there was no place of worship between Nanaimo and Alberni. The east window was a gift from E.B. May in 1938, in memory of his wife, Dorothy May.<br /> Visit the gravestone of “baby Christina” &#8211; Christina Morison passed away at just 6 weeks old in July of 1897. Many graves have a plasticized write up telling the story of the inhabitant.<br /> <a href="https://img.geocaching.com/waymarking/a65296e7-0a5e-4f18-b7f7-2438e4d51382.jpg"><noscript><img decoding="async" src="https://img.geocaching.com/waymarking/large/a65296e7-0a5e-4f18-b7f7-2438e4d51382.jpg" border="0" /></noscript><img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://img.geocaching.com/waymarking/large/a65296e7-0a5e-4f18-b7f7-2438e4d51382.jpg" border="0" /></a><br /> <strong>Monks Art Gallery.</strong></p><p><strong>Qualicum Beach Heritage Forest.</strong> 5 minutes from downtown Qualicum Beach are 50 acres of rare old growth forest – a mixture of Coastal Douglas Fir, Western Red Cedar, Hemlock, Grand Fir and Sitka Spruce. The park is centred on a lush ravine with a salmon stream. There are few truly large trees but it makes for a pleasant walk in the middle of a town.<br /> <strong><br /> NEARBY HIKES</strong><br /> <strong>HORNBY ISLAND </strong><br /> <strong>1. Mt.

I have been retired since 2006 and in that time have traveled every winter for four to seven months. The months that I am "home", are often also spent on the road, hiking or kayaking. 
I hope to present a website that describes my travel along with my hiking and sea kayaking experiences.<div id="author-link"> <a href="../../../../author/admin/index.html" rel="author"> View all posts by admin <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span> </a></div></div></div><div class="entry-utility"> This entry was posted in <a href="../../../../category/uncategorized/index.html" rel="category tag">Uncategorized</a>.
