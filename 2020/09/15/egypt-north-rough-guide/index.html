Egypt is bordered by Israel and the Gaza Strip to the northeast, by Sudan to the south and by Libya to the west. The country is bounded by the Mediterranean and Red Seas (to the north and east respectively) and geographically dominated both by the Nile River and its fertile well-watered valley and by the Eastern and Western deserts.<br /> Egypt is perhaps best known as the home of the ancient Egyptian civilization, with its temples, hieroglyphs, mummies, and &#8211; visible above all &#8211; its pyramids. Less well-known is Egypt&#8217;s medieval heritage, courtesy of Coptic Christianity and Islam &#8211; ancient churches, monasteries and mosques punctuate the Egyptian landscape. Egypt stimulates the imagination of Western tourists like few other countries and is probably one of the most popular tourist destinations worldwide.</p><p><strong>Tourism. </strong>Ever since the 2011 revolution, tourism (which provides about 15% of employment in Egypt, so one-sixth of the population are reliant upon it) has taken a major hit. Because of the downturn in tourism, expect more persistent and aggressive touts, but prices are lower and you can avoid the gigantic crowds that, at other periods, were typically overflowing the marvellous sites.<br /> The more recent counter-revolution and Military putsch, like many events of its sort, has brought repression, death sentences and imprisonment for many Egyptians (and foreign journalists) but has resulted in lower crime and reduced disruption for well-heeled foreign tourists.<br /> <strong>Climate. </strong>Egypt is largely a desert, an extension of the great Sahara that bands North Africa. Save for the thin strip of watered land along the Nile River broadening into the Nile delta, very little could survive here. Generally, the summers are hot and dry and the winters are moderate. November through March are the most comfortable months for travel in Egypt. There is almost no rain in the Nile Valley.<br /> The north coast along the Mediterranean Sea 50km southwards receives some of the most heavy rain in the country during winter months.<br /> Visitors should be aware that most houses and apartments in Cairo and Egypt do not have central heating</p><p><strong>Money.</strong> Egyptian pound (EGP), often written as LE, (French livre égyptienne) or by using the pound sign £ with or without additional letters: E£ and £E.<br /> Hoard your small bills! Egypt has a perpetual shortage of small bills and change: even banks are reluctant to break too many bills. Vendors will also perpetually say they don&#8217;t have change and want small bills. Hoard your small bills as much as you can, be prepared to make bank runs for change, and break your bills in the easiest situations such as large supermarkets.<br /> <em><strong>Black Market Money</strong></em>. The Egyptian pound has been devaluing gradually over the last several decades. Since 2011, the exchange rate has become relatively unstable and inflation sped up. As of 2013, the Egyptian pound was worth about 11 times less than at its peak.<br /> As of late 2016, the Central Bank has attempted to fix the value of the Egyptian Pound to the US dollar at a rate of EGP1:USD17.7. This has led to a shortage of foreign exchange and as of December 2014, a black market in foreign currency emerged. Dollars attract the greatest premium. Generally, high street foreign exchange offices will offer the black market rate &#8211; the rates they publish are to a large extent fictional.<br /> <em>Exchanging money and banks. </em>In a black market economy, you can&#8217;t use banks or ATM.<br /> <em>Credit cards:</em> Debit and credit cards are generally not accepted except at hotels, large supermarkets and shopping malls targeted at foreigners.<br /> <em>Tipping.</em> Small bill tipping is encouraged as people are generally poor and tipping is a significant part of their income.<br /> <strong>Scams.</strong> A common scam of vendors, ticket sellers, taxi drivers etc. will try is to claim that you only gave him a 10LE note, when you gave him a 100LE note &#8211; this can lead to a heated argument &#8211; best to treat it as an &#8216;honest mistake&#8217; so that the vendor does not lose face, then suggest that the police or tourist police can help. As a general rule whenever giving over large bills say out loud their value so both you and the vendor know the value of the notes.<br /> Shopping. In Egypt, prices are often increased for foreigners, so if you see a price on a price tag, it may be wise to learn the local Eastern Arabic numerals:</p><p><strong>NOMAD MANIA EGYPT</strong><br /> <strong><em>Experiences<br /> </em></strong>Cruise down the Nile<br /> Experience Belly dance<br /> Haggle at the bazaar<br /> Play/hear <strong>sistrum. </strong>A musical instrument of the percussion family, chiefly associated with ancient Egypt. It consists of a handle and a U-shaped metal frame, made of brass or bronze and between 30 and 76 cm in width. When shaken, the small rings or loops of thin metal on its movable crossbars produce a sound that can be from a soft clank to a loud jangling. <sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><br /> </sup><strong>Sham al-Naseem </strong>is an Egyptian national holiday marking the beginning of spring. It always falls on Easter Monday, the day after Easter. The holiday is celebrated by both Muslim Egyptians and Christian Egyptians alike, it is considered a national festival in Egypt, whose history goes back to ancient Egyptian times. The main features of the festival are: People spend all day out picnicking in any space of green, public gardens, on the Nile, or at the zoo. Traditional food eaten on this day consists mainly of <i>fesikh</i> (a fermented, salted and dried grey mullet), lettuce, scallions or green onions, and <i>termes</i>. Coloring boiled eggs, then eating and gifting them.</p><p><strong>EGYPT &#8211; CENTRAL – Cairo, Giza, Faiyum, Beni Suef, Minya</strong><strong><em><br /> </em>Historic Cairo</strong>. World Heritage Site. Tucked away amid the modern urban area of Cairo lies one of the world&#8217;s oldest Islamic cities, with its famous mosques, <em>madrasas, hammams</em> and fountains. Founded in the 10th century, it became the new centre of the Islamic world, reaching its golden age in the 14th century.<br /> Islamic Cairo refers to the central parts around the old walled city and around the Citadel of Cairo. &#8220;Islamic&#8221; Cairo refers to the city&#8217;s rich history and heritage since its foundation in the early period of Islam, while distinguishing it from the nearby Ancient Egyptian sites of Giza and Memphis.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_1-0" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"></sup> This area holds one of the largest and densest concentrations of historic architecture in the Islamic world.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_1-1" class="reference"></sup> It is characterized by hundreds of mosques, tombs, madrasas, mansions, caravanserais, and fortifications dating from throughout the Islamic era of Egypt.<br /> The history of Cairo begins with the conquest of Egypt by Muslim Arabs in 640. The choice of this location may have been due to its slightly closer proximity to Arabia and Mecca, the fear of strong remaining Christian and Hellenistic influence in Alexandria, and Alexandria&#8217;s vulnerability to Byzantine counteroffensives arriving by sea (which did indeed occur).<sup id="cite_ref-Raymond1993_4-1" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:3_5-0" class="reference"></sup><br /> The most prominent architectural heritage of medieval Cairo, however, dates from the Mamluk period, from 1250 to 1517 AD. The Mamluk sultans and elites were eager patrons of religious and scholarly life, commonly building religious or funerary complexes whose functions could include a mosque, madrasa, khanqah (for Sufis), water distribution centers (sabils), and mausoleum for themselves and their families. Among the best-known examples of Mamluk monuments in Cairo are the huge Mosque-Madrasa of Sultan Hasan, the Mosque of Amir al-Maridani, the Mosque of Sultan al-Mu&#8217;ayyad (whose twin minarets were built above the gate of Bab Zuwayla), the Sultan Al-Ghuri complex, the funerary complex of Sultan Qaytbay in the Northern Cemetery, and the trio of monuments in the Bayn al-Qasrayn area comprising the complex of Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun, the Madrasa of al-Nasir Muhammad, and the Madrasa of Sultan Barquq.<br /> <span id="Shrines_and_mausoleums" class="mw-headline">Shrines and mausoleums. </span>al-Hussein Mosque, the Mausoleum of Imam al-Shafi&#8217;i.

In the Western Desert of Egypt, contains invaluable fossil remains of the earliest, and now extinct, a suborder of whales, Archaeoceti. These fossils represent one of the major stories of evolution: the emergence of the whale as an ocean-going mammal from a previous life as a land-based animal. This is the most important site in the world for the demonstration of this stage of evolution. It portrays vividly the form and life of these whales during their transition. The number, concentration and quality of such fossils here are unique, as are their accessibility and setting in an attractive and protected landscape. The fossils of Al-Hitan show the youngest archaeocetes, in the last stages of losing their hind limbs.</p><div class="box"><div class="icaption bordered"><a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1186/gallery/"><img decoding="async" class="" title="Wadi Al-Hitan (Whale Valley)" src="https://whc.unesco.org/uploads/thumbs/site_1186_0012-750-0-20151104170818.jpg" data-src="https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img/https://www.ronperrier.net/uploads/thumbs/site_1186_0012-750-0-20151104170818.jpg" /></a></div><div></div><div class="clear"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">The globally important fossils of Wadi Al-Hitan (Whale Valley), in the Western Desert of Egypt, provide dramatic evidence of one of the iconic stories of evolution: the emergence of whales as ocean-going mammals, from their previous life as land-based animals.<br /> </span></span><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">Only about 1,000 visitors a year drive into Wadi Al-Hitan by 4WD because the track is unpaved and crosses unmarked desert sands.<br /> </span></span><span style="font-size: 16px;">Visitors are restricted to prearranged guided tours along a prescribed trail.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Since part of Wadi Al-Hitan was made into a tourist venue, walkways between the main fossils have been laid out and small shelters built.

Its fame comes from its being the first Capital of Ancient Egypt. The unrivalled geographic location of Memphis, both commanding the entrance to the Delta while being at the confluence of important trade routes, means that there was no possible alternative capital for any ruler with a serious ambition to govern both Upper and Lower Egypt. Traditionally believed to have been founded in 3000 BC as the capital of a politically unified Egypt, Memphis served as the effective administrative capital of the country during the Old Kingdom, then during at least part of the Middle and New Kingdoms (besides Itjtawy and Thebes), the Late Period and again in the Ptolemaic Period (along with the city of Alexandria), until it was eclipsed by the foundation of the Islamic garrison city of Fustat on the Nile and its later development, Al Qahira. As well as the home of kings, and the centre of state administration, Memphis was considered to be a site sacred to the gods.<br /> The site contains many archaeological remains, reflecting what life was like in the ancient Egyptian city, which includes temples, of which the most important is the Temple of Ptah in Mit Rahina. Ptah was the local god of Memphis, the god of creation and the patron of craftsmanship. Other major religious buildings included the sun temples in Abu Ghurab and Abusir, the temple of the god Apis in Memphis, the Serapeum and the Heb-Sed temple in Saqqara. Being the seat of royal power for over eight dynasties, the city also contained palaces and ruins survive of the palace of Apries overlooking the city. The palaces and temples were surrounded by craftsmen’s workshops, dockyards and arsenals, as well as residential neighbourhoods, traces of which survive.<br /> The Necropolis of Memphis extends south and north and contains the Pyramid Complex of Saqqarathe, the first complex of monumental stone buildings in Egyptian history and royal tombs from the early shape called &#8220;mastaba&#8221; (the first pyramid ever built &#8211; the Pyramid of Djoser, or the Step Pyramid) until it reaches the pyramid shape. More than thirty-eight pyramids include the three pyramids of Giza, of which the Great Pyramid of Khufu is the only surviving wonder of the ancient world and one of the most important monuments in the history of humankind, the pyramids of Abusir, Saqqara and Dahshur, the Great Sphinx and the great statue of Rameses II at Mit Rahina. Besides these monumental creations, there are more than nine thousand rock-cut tombs, from different historical periods, ranging from the First to the Thirtieth Dynasty, and extending to the Graeco-Roman Period.</p><p><strong>CAIRO </strong>(21.3 million).

After the French withdrew in 1801, control of Egypt was nominally restored to the Ottoman Empire, but was disputed between the old Mamluk elite, Egyptian nobles, and the Ottomans. Makram allied with Muhammad Ali, the commander of Albanian troops within the army sent by the Empire to restore order.<br /> In May 1805, Egyptians led by Makram forced the Ottomans to replace the <i>Wāli</i> Ahmad Khurshid Pasha with Muhammad Ali. Makram soon discovered that Muhammad Ali planned to rule Egypt himself. Makram objected to a foreign ruler. Muhammad Ali exiled Makram to Damietta in 1809, where he stayed for four years. Makram then moved to Tanta, where he died in 1822.<br /> A mosque named for him and designed by Mario Rossi stands in Tahrir Square in Cairo. <strong>Statue of Ibrahim Pasha. </strong>(1789 – 1848) was the eldest son of Muhammad Ali, the Wāli and unrecognized Khedive of Egypt and Sudan. He served as a general in the Egyptian army. In the final year of his life, he succeeded his still-living father as ruler of Egypt and Sudan, due to the latter&#8217;s ill health. It extended over the other dominions that his father had brought under Egyptian rule, namely Syria, Hejaz, Morea, Thasos, and Crete. Ibrahim pre-deceased his father, dying only four months after acceding to the throne. Ibrahim remains one of the most celebrated members of the Muhammad Ali dynasty, particularly for his impressive military victories, including several crushing defeats of the Ottoman Empire. Among Egyptian historians, Ibrahim, his father Muhammad Ali, and his son Ismail the Magnificent are held in far higher esteem than other rulers from the dynasty, who were largely viewed as indolent and corrupt; this is largely the result of efforts by his grandson Fuad I of Egypt to ensure the positive portrayal of his paternal ancestors in the Royal Archives that he created, which were the primary source for Egyptian history from the 1920s until the 1970s.</p><p><strong style="font-size: 16px;"><em>OTHER DESTINATIONS</em></strong><br /> <strong>El Alamein War Cemetery</strong>, El Alamein. The Dark Side. The campaign in the Western Desert was fought between the Commonwealth forces (with, later, the addition of two brigades of Free French and one each of Polish and Greek troops) all based in Egypt, and the Axis forces (German and Italian) based in Libya. The battlefield, across which the fighting surged back and forth between 1940 and 1942, was the 1,000 kilometres of desert between Alexandria in Egypt and Benghazi in Libya. It was a campaign of manoeuvre and movement, the objectives being the control of the Mediterranean, the link with the east through the Suez Canal, the Middle East oil supplies and the supply route to Russia through Persia. EL ALAMEIN WAR CEMETERY contains the graves of men who died at all stages of the Western Desert campaigns, brought in from a wide area, but especially those who died in the Battle of El Alamein at the end of October 1942 and in the period immediately before that. The cemetery now contains 7,240 Commonwealth burials of the Second World War, of which 815 are unidentified. There are also 102 war graves of other nationalities. The ALAMEIN CREMATION MEMORIAL, which stands in the southeastern part of El Alamein War Cemetery, commemorates more than 600 men whose remains were cremated in Egypt and Libya during the war, under their faith. The entrance to the cemetery is formed by the ALAMEIN MEMORIAL. The Land Forces panels commemorate more than 8,500 soldiers of the Commonwealth who died in the campaigns in Egypt and Libya, and in the operations of the Eighth Army in Tunisia up to 19 February 1943, who have no known grave. It also commemorates those who served and died in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Persia. The Air Forces panels commemorate more than 3,000 airmen of the Commonwealth who died in the campaigns in Egypt, Libya, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Greece, Crete and the Aegean, Ethiopia, Eritrea and the Somalilands, the Sudan, East Africa, Aden and Madagascar, who have no known grave. Those who served with the Rhodesian and South African Air Training Scheme and have no known grave are also commemorated here.</p><p><strong>MARSA MATROUH. </strong>A port 240 km (150 mi) west of Alexandria and 222 km (138 mi) east of Sallum on the main highway from the Nile Delta to the Libyan border.

Historically, it was part of Ancient Egypt.<br /> In the 26th Dynasty, a necropolis was established. Ancient Greek settlers at Cyrene made contact with the oasis then (7th century BCE), and the oracle temple of Amun (Greek: <i>Zeus Ammon</i>), who, Herodotus was told, took the image here of a ram. In 708 the Siwans resisted an Islamic army and probably did not convert until the 12th century. Only seven families with 40 men lived at the oasis in 1203.<br /> The Siwans are a Berber people, so demographically and culturally were more closely related to nearby Libya, which has a large Berber population, than to Egypt, which has a negligible Berber population.<br /> <strong>Climate:</strong> hot desert<br /> <strong>Culture.</strong> Until a tarmac road was built to the Mediterranean coast in the 1980s Siwa&#8217;s only links with the outside world were by arduous camel tracks through the desert. These were used to export dates and olives, bring trade goods, or carry pilgrims on the route which linked the Maghreb to Cairo and hence to Mecca. <sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"></sup>As a result of this isolation, Siwis developed a unique natural culture manifested in its crafts of basketry, pottery, silverwork and embroidery and in its style of dress. The most visible and celebrated examples of this were the bridal silver and the ensemble of silver ornaments and beads that women wore in abundance to weddings and other ceremonies. <sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"></sup>The best known of these pieces is a huge silver disc called &#8216;adrim&#8217; and a torc, called &#8216;aghraw&#8217; from which it hung over the breast.<br /> <em>The Siyaha Festival</em>, in honour of the town&#8217;s traditional patron saint Sidi Sulayman, is unique to Siwa. Siwi children traditionally also celebrated Ashura by lighting torches, singing, and exchanging sweets. Adults&#8217; celebration was limited to the preparation of a large meal.<br /> <strong>Homosexuality.</strong> Siwa is of special interest to anthropologists and sociologists because of its historical acceptance of male homosexuality and even rituals celebrating same-sex marriage &#8211; traditions that the Egyptian authorities have sought to repress, with increasing success, since the early twentieth century. The practice probably arose because from ancient times unmarried men and adolescent boys were required to live and work together outside the town of Shali.<br /> Although Siwan men could take up to four wives, &#8220;Siwan customs allow a man but one boy to whom he is bound by a stringent code of obligations.&#8221; In 1937 the anthropologist Walter Cline wrote the first detailed ethnography of the Siwans in which he noted: &#8220;All normal Siwan men and boys practice sodomy&#8230;among themselves, the natives are not ashamed of this; they talk about it as openly as they talk about love of women, and many if not most of their fights arise from homosexual competition&#8230;.Prominent men lend their sons to each other. All Siwans know the matings which have taken place among their sheiks and their sheiks&#8217; sons&#8230;Most of the boys used in sodomy are between twelve and eighteen years of age.&#8221; Homosexuality was not merely rampant, it was raging&#8230;Every dancer had his boyfriend&#8230;[and] chiefs had harems of boys&#8221;.<br /> In the late 1940s, Siwan women were &#8220;badly neglected&#8221;, but Siwan men &#8220;will kill each other for a boy. Never for a woman&#8221;, although as Maugham noted, marriage to a boy had become illegal by then. Now the practice is not followed.&#8221; Despite the multiplicity of sources for these practices, the Egyptian authorities and even the Siwan tribal elders have attempted to repress the historical and anthropological record. Agriculture is the main activity of modern Siwa, particularly the cultivation of dates and olives. Handicrafts like basketry are also of regional importance.<sup id="cite_ref-EBsiwa_1-7" class="reference"><br /> </sup>Tourism has in recent decades become a vital source of income.

A town, monastery complex and Christian pilgrimage centre in Late Antique Egypt, about 50 km southwest of Alexandria. There are very few standing remains, but the foundations of most major buildings, such as the Great Basilica, are easily discernible.

Abu Mena was destroyed during the early Muslim conquests of the mid-7th century.</p><p><strong>Alexandria, Ancient Remains and the New Library</strong>. Tentative WHS (28/07/2003). In 332 BC, Alexander the Great who was welcomed as a liberator, first went to Memphis, the capital of Pharaonic Egypt, to honour the Egyptian gods and to receive the royal investiture as Pharaoh, then to the village of Rakhotis to the west of the delta near the Mediterranean, to found Alexandria whose perimeter he drew himself and ordered his architect, Dinocrates of Rhodes, to draw up the plan. Then after only six months, he left Egypt. After he died in 322 BC, he was buried in Memphis for some time. He was then brought to Alexandria by Ptolemy for re-burial in the Sema or Soma necropolis which became that of his successors, the Ptolemy dynasty. His successors, Ptolemy I and his son Ptolemy II (285-246 BC) then the whole dynasty of the Ptolemies, developed the city, built numerous grandiose monuments and decorated it in the fashion both of the Greeks and the Egyptians.<br /> Thus in 641 AD Alexandria became a great metropolis receptive to both Egyptian and Hellenistic influences. The ancient city &#8220;Full of temples, theatres and colossal palaces, the city was magnificent, spreading five kilometres along the coast with a width of 1½ kilometres. It was surrounded by powerful fortifications and was based on an irregular quadrilateral plan. It had different quarters for the Egyptians, Greeks and Jews, as well as necropolises and residential areas. It had two ports, as the stretch of water between the coast and the <strong>island of Pharos</strong> had been divided into two by Heptastades, through an approx. 1.800 m jetty which connected the island with the land.<br /> To the east was the Portus Magnus alongside which, from the small peninsula of Lochias right up to the quarter of Bronkhion, were the <strong>palaces of the Ptolemies, the Emporium and the Caesium</strong>, the temple which Cleopatra had built in Anthony&#8217;s honour and which was completed by Augustus and consecrated for the Imperial cult. The Heliopolis obelisks which stood in front of this monument are now in London and in New York. On an island connected to the land, Anthony built the <strong>Timonion</strong>, a royal palace to which he withdrew after the defeat of Actium. At the end of the islet of Pharos stood the <strong>tower of Pharos</strong> which gave its name to the signalling system which was so useful to the navigators. In the middle of the city was the <strong>Soma</strong> or Suma, the necropolis of the Ptolemies where Alexander was buried and the <strong>Museon</strong>, a college of erudite philosophers where the famous library founded by Ptolemy I was to be found and which was enlarged by his son Ptolemy II Philadelphus and organized by Demetrios Phaleris.<br /> Alexandria, thanks to its port, rapidly became one of the great centres of commercial activity in Antiquity and replaced Tyre.<br /> The <strong>Lighthouse of Alexandria</strong> was commissioned by Ptolemy II with three superimposed elements which were square, octagonal and circular (the whole structure being over 120 m high). The lighthouse was one of the seven wonders of the world in antiquity. Its outline is known only from coins, a Byzantine mosaic discovered in Libya and the remains of a similar lighthouse in Taposiris Magna. Badly damaged due to the lack of maintenance because of Alexandria&#8217;s decline during the Byzantine era, it received a final blow during an earthquake which struck the region at the beginning of the XIIth century. The Mamelukes built in its place in the XVth century the present <strong>fort of Qayt Bey</strong> (XV century). Underwater excavations brought to light some elements which had fallen into the sea, some of which are blocks of over 50 tons which, aligned on the ground, could be part of the lighthouse&#8217;s socle.<br /> In less than a century, becoming greater than Carthage, it was deemed to be the most brilliant city after Rome where Greek culture sparkled in all its splendour. Euclides founded a school of mathematics which lasted for several centuries; there Archimedes of Syracuse made numerous discoveries. Hipparchus the father of astronomy, Eratosthenes of Cyrene, was known for his scientific geography, Heropheles the physician practised surgery there and many other scientists and scholars frequented the Museon and the library which made it famous for several centuries.<br /> <strong>The Library of Alexandria</strong> contained between 400.000 and 700.000 rolls of papyrus dealing with all the sciences. When Julius Caesar landed in Egypt, a fire partially destroyed the library. Anthony reconstituted it with 200.000 volumes from Pergamon. A slanderous legend says that it was finally burned down by the Arab conqueror Amr Ibn al-As. In reality, the &#8220;Great Library&#8221; like the palace, probably disappeared between 270 and 250 A.D. It was certainly the greatest and the richest in the ancient world where famous people from all over the world, could be met there as well as in the Museum of which it was a part. This vast structure, which included conference halls, observatories, a park, a zoo and refectories, was unique in the world&#8221;.<br /> <strong>Cleopatra</strong>, the last of the Ptolemy dynasty, was crowned in Alexandria; there she met Anthony and together they met their tragic end. The second city of the Roman empire with its 500.000 inhabitants, Alexandria enjoyed two more centuries of splendour. In 30 BC, Egypt became a Roman province. Vespasian was proclaimed emperor in Alexandria in 69 AD. Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius stayed there. Cleopatra &#8220;Between myth and reality, legend and history, the last of the Ptolemies is still full of fascination today. Daughter of Ptolemy XII, she acceded to the throne in 51 BC under the guardianship of the Roman senate represented by Pompey, at the same time as her brother and husband Ptolemy XIII. After Caesar&#8217;s death (44 BC) with whom she had a son, she seduced Mark Anthony, the new Master of the East. She won Phoenicia, Syria, Cyprus, part of Cilicia and the Nabatean Kingdom. The battle of Actium in 31 BC rang her death knoll. Octavius (the future Augustus) there defeated Anthony who, believing Cleopatra to be dead, committed suicide. Cleopatra, having first tried to seduce the victor, handed over Alexandria and then killed herself&#8221;.<br /> Christianity spread very quickly and became the State religion in 392 AD. The Byzantine emperor Theodosius II ordered the destruction of the pagan temples including the famous Serapeum of Alexandria and Diocletian ordered the whole city to be sacked. A cosmopolitan cultural centre, Alexandria greatly contributed to the success of the new religion which found philosophical sustenance there and partly drew upon the tradition of ancient Egypt until the arrival of the Moslems in 642 AD.<br /> <strong>What is there today</strong> of the ancient city? There is no lighthouse, no library, and no palaces of the Ptolemies, all have vanished. The sea near the coast conceals statues some colossal, great blocks of stones, marble or granite. Three groups:<br /> Huge monuments and structures: <strong>Pompey&#8217;s Column</strong> is a monolithic column hewn out of a single block of Aswan granite erected by Diocletian in 297 AD &#8211; 22m high, diameter 2,70 m at the base, a socle 8 m high, a huge Corinthian capital in granite which bore the equestrian statue of Diocletian until the seventh century.

Open to the Mediterranean in the middle of the IXth century, to fortify against Byzantine it was built in 870 but took seven centuries until the Ottomans in 1517, to start three centuries (from the XVIth to the XIXth century)<br /> This prosperity was followed by the departure of the French Expedition (1798-1801) and the great families followed by the negligence of the civil public and even religious buildings and Rachid lost its role as the main intermediary in Egyptian inland traffic. In 1859, the Suez Canal was dug and with it the new port of Port Said was developed on the eastern Delta. The two ports, Alexandria to the west and Port Said to the east became formidable rivals against which the town could offer no resistance. The almost total obstruction of the branch of the Nile (Rachid), silting up of the port and invading dunes around the town. The great Aswan Dam aggravated the situation even more as the alluviums were no longer flushed out of the delta.<br /> Two centuries ago there were 35.000 people. Narrow streets intersecting at right angles, the last vestiges of urbanism typical of the XVIth-XVIIth centuries, lined with two- or three-storeyed houses, with mosques, hammams, oukalas… then the remains of a citadel built by Qaïtbey in 1479 where the famous Rosetta stone was found which bears an inscription in three languages, thanks to which Champollion was able to pierce the mystery of the hieroglyphs. At the beginning of the XXth century, 38 houses had been classed as historical monuments and 22 of them have survived today. A ground floor and one or two storeys, façades decorated with polychrome bricks, red, black and white, corbelling out into the street and splendid moucharabiehs (worked wood windows).<br /> <strong>Fort Julien (Fort of Qaitbey), </strong>Rasheed. On the left or west bank of the Nile about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) north-west of Rashid (Rosetta) on the north coast of Egypt, it was originally built by the Ottoman Empire and occupied by the French during Napoleon Bonaparte&#8217;s campaign in Egypt and Syria between 1798 and 1801.

They are about 10 km south of Zafarana, on the shore of the Red Sea (about 230 km south-east of Cairo). Wadi Natrun is a 25 km long depression in the western desert halfway between Cairo and Alexandria where there are about a dozen saline lakes, two of which, the Bouhaïret el-Gounfadiya and the Bouhaïret el-Hamra, provide natron, the sodium carbonate used by the Pharaohs for mummification.<br /> <em><strong>Monastery of St. Anthony</strong></em>. On the flank of Gabal al-Alaa al-Qibliya is the cave of St. Anthony where he lived until he died in 356 AD. The oldest monastery in Egypt. St. Anthony, with St. Pacomius (287-347 AD) was one of the first leaders of the Church, and founders of Christian monasticism. Anthony (251-356 AD) abandoned his property and retired to the Arab Desert to live there as a hermit. He chose the Gebel el Qalaa el-Qibliya to come closer to God and lived in a cave where his disciples founded a monastery.<br /> The village had a church built on top of the Saint’s tomb (XIIIth century frescoes), chapels, bread oven, mills, cells and gardens that grew up around the cave and have survived up to the present day The church, has a square narthex and a square chancel and two wheat flour mills.<br /> <em><strong>Monastery of St. Paulhe</strong></em>. Further to the west on the same mountain, this is where St. Paul lived for 60 years according to the legend at the beginning of the 4th century AD). Born in Thebaid around 225 AD, Paul became a hermit to escape from the persecutions of Christians under the emperor Decius, He crossed the desert and settled in a cave on the flank of Gabal el Qalaa el Qibliya, an inhospitable mountain scorched by the sun. He left numerous disciples behind at his death who, to perpetuate his memory, set up a community on the site of his tomb which became the nucleus of the present monastery. Smaller than St. Anthony, the St. Paul monastery had undergone less changes and today seems to be hemmed in with all its buildings within a medieval precinct. A square tower, a refuge for the monks in case of an attack, has chapels as at St. Anthony’s, and also cells, storerooms and water supplied through an underground canal from the monastery’s well. St. Paul’s church is decorated with numerous paintings from the XVIIIth century, including those of saints on horseback, namely St. George, St. Theodore and Michael the Archangel striking at the demons. On the church roof is a chapel. The church of St. Mercurius is located slightly above the St. Paul’s church.<br /> Only four out of the fifty Coptic monasteries which existed in the past have survived to the present day. One is the St. Macarius monastery (Deir Abu Makaria) 94 km southeast of Cairo and the three others, the monastery of the Romans (Deir el Baramos), the monastery of the Syrians (Deir es-Souriyan) and the St. Pshoï monastery (Deir Amba Bichoi) are 10 km away from the first monastery.<br /> The Monasteries of Natrun<br /> <strong><em>The Saint Macarius Monastery</em></strong> was Founded in the IVth century in Wadi Natrun disciples continued living as hermits, in almost total isolation. Very quickly many isolated hermits settled in the region, and then fifty monasteries were established. Four of these monasteries survived. The most important and the biggest in Wadi Natrun and Egypt is St. Macarius. Developed remarkably in the VIth century, as it was used as a refuge by the Coptic Patriarchs of Alexandria. In 866 the church was rebuilt and the ramparts consolidated so it was able to survive to the present day. An imposing tower with three floors which was used as a refuge. The relics of St. Macarius, St. John the Baptist and the prophet Elisha are fervently venerated<br /> The Church of the Forty-Nine Martyrs recalls the massacre of the monastery’s monks by desert plunderers in 444.<br /> The Monastery of St. Pschoi has five churches within a walled enclosure.

A Coptic Orthodox monastery located in Wadi El Natrun in the Nitrian Desert and the most northern among the four current monasteries of Scetes, situated around 9 km northeast of the Monastery of Saint Pishoy.<br /> The Paromeos Monastery is probably the oldest among the four existing monasteries of Scetes. It was founded c. 335 A.D. by Saint Macarius the Great. Destroyed in 407 A.D. by the Berbers, it was rebuilt and destroyed again in 410 A.D, so in 859-880 built 10-11m high walls around the monasteries of the Nitrian Desert. There were 12 monks in 1712, 9 in 1799, 30 in 1905, 35 in 1937, 20 in 1960 and 46 in 1970. Today, it has five churches.

From the same century is the ivory screen of the iconostasis represented religious scenes, portraits and geometric designs. Other impressive frescoes decorate the semi-cupolas of the chancel. The Church of the Holy Virgin Mary contains relics. It is close to the churches of the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste, of St. Hennis and St. Marutha (XVth century). Hundreds of old manuscripts are kept in the library of the monastery.</p><p><strong>ALEXANDRIA </strong>(pop 5,200,000). The third-largest city in Egypt after Cairo and Giza, the seventh-largest city in Africa, and a major economic centre. The largest city on the Mediterranean – also called the &#8220;Bride of the Mediterranean&#8221; by locals – is the fourth-largest city in the Arab world and the ninth-largest urban area in Africa. The city extends about 40 km (25 mi) at the northern coast of Egypt along the Mediterranean Sea. Alexandria is a popular tourist destination, and also an important industrial centre because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez.<br /> Alexandria was founded in 331 BC by Alexander the Great, king of Macedon and leader of the Greek League of Corinth, during his conquest of the Achaemenid Empire. An Egyptian village named Rhacotis existed at the location and grew into the Egyptian quarter of Alexandria. Alexandria grew rapidly to become an important centre of Hellenistic civilization and remained the capital of Ptolemaic Egypt and Roman and Byzantine Egypt for almost 1,000 years, until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in AD 641, when a new capital was founded at Fustat (later absorbed into Cairo). Hellenistic Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria (<i>Pharos</i>), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World; its Great Library (the largest in the ancient world); and the Necropolis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages. Alexandria was the intellectual and cultural centre of the ancient Mediterranean world for much of the Hellenistic age and late antiquity. It was at one time the largest city in the ancient world before being eventually overtaken by Rome.<br /> The city was a major centre of early Christianity and the centre of the Patriarchate of Alexandria, which was one of the major centres of Christianity in the Eastern Roman Empire. In the modern world, the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria both lay claim to this ancient heritage.<br /> By the Arab conquest of Egypt in 641 AD, the city had already been largely plundered and lost its significance before re-emerging in the modern era. From the late 18th century, Alexandria became a major centre of the international shipping industry and one of the most important trading centres in the world, both because it profited from the easy overland connection between the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, and the lucrative trade in Egyptian cotton.<br /> Alexandria Airport (HBE)<br /> <strong>Ruins of Tanis. </strong>An important archaeological site on the Tanitic branch of the Nile, which has long since silted up &#8211; in the northeastern Nile Delta. 1825: two pink granite sphinxes now in the Musée du Louvre; 1939: royal necropolis. Today the temple of Amun-Re has large obelisks fallen to the ground and lying in a single direction, Archaeologists have counted more than twenty.<br /> <strong>Taposiris Magna. </strong>A city established by Ptolemy II Philadelphus between 280-270 BCE. The name means &#8220;great tomb of Osiris&#8221;. After Alexander the Great conquered Egypt in 332 BC, it became a center for the religious festival of Khoiak. Role in the trade between Egypt and Libya using water transportation to the harbour and then a caravan route.<br /> Atop the Taenia ridge, an outcropping of limestone which separates the sea from Lake Maerotis, stand two monuments that were partly restored in the 1930s. One a tower used in the reconstruction of the lighthouse of Alexandria and the other is the remains of a temple of Osiris that is also believed to be the last resting place of Cleopatra.<br /> &#8220;The Tower of Abusir&#8221; was not a lighthouse or a watchtower, but a funerary monument. <sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"></sup>The necropolis shows a variety of burial styles from sarcophagi or pyramids to columns or pilasters. This ancient settlement was occupied from the second century BC to the seventh century AD.<sup id="cite_ref-Lloyd2010_7-0" class="reference"></sup><br /> <strong>Cecil Hotel. </strong>Hospitality Legends. Four-star Steigenberger Cecil Hotel was built in 1929 by the Metzger family as a romantic hotel, at Saad Zaghloul Square where Cleopatra&#8217;s needles had been, in front of the Corniche. Author Somerset Maugham stayed here, as did Winston Churchill and Al Capone. Moreover, the British Secret Service maintained a suite for their operations. It was seized by the Egyptian government after the revolution in 1952, and five years later the Metzger family was expelled from the country. In 2007, after a lengthy court battle, legal ownership of the hotel was returned to the Metzger family, who subsequently sold it to the Egyptian government. It operated for many years as the Sofitel Cecil Alexandria Hotel, until it joined the Steigenberger Hotels chain in 2014.<br /> <strong>Délices. </strong>Hospitality Legends. This old tea room has been in business since 1922 and is <em>the</em> place to come for tea and cake. Although much of its original grandeur has been scrubbed away, its high-ceilinged halls still exude a sense of old-world atmosphere. The patisserie here once supplied Egypt&#8217;s royalty and the cafe was a favourite haunt of Allied soldiers during WWII.<br /> On a hot day, order the specialty Deliccino drink (ice cream and espresso milkshake). There&#8217;s also a full menu of crêpes, pasta and sandwiches. One area has been turned into a hipper, air-conditioned cafe, very popular with local women.<br /> <strong>Trianon. </strong>Hospitality Legends. Admire the 1930s grandeur of its sensational ornate ceiling and faded but still glorious wall panels. Grab a slice of something from the patisserie selection, order a juice or a coffee, and soak up the historic atmosphere. Part of the cafe is a restaurant serving Mediterranean food, with mediocre pizzas but better plates of pasta. Trianon was a favourite haunt of the Greek poet Cavafy, who worked in offices on the floor above.</p><p><strong>DO</strong><br /> Ancient temples and artifacts of ancient Egypt.<br /> See within each city &#8211; its own history, culture, activities, and people who often differ in nature from people of other parts of Egypt.<br /> <strong><em>Sporting and Recreational Clubs</em></strong>: If the heat is too much, you can go to one of the famous sporting clubs such as the Gezira Club located in Zamalek, or the Seid Club in Mohandiseen, where you can have a dip at the swimming pool or otherwise enjoy sitting in the shade and comfort of lush trees and gardens.
