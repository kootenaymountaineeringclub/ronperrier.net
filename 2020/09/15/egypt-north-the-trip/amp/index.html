<div class="sp-cnt"> <div class="cntr"> <div class="sp-rl"> <div class="sp-rt"> <div class="cntn-wrp artl-cnt"> <div class="pf-content"><p><strong>Egypt</strong> extends into Asia at the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is bordered by Israel and the Gaza Strip to the northeast, by Sudan to the south and by Libya to the west. The country is bounded by the Mediterranean and Red Seas (to the north and east respectively) and geographically dominated both by the Nile River and its fertile well-watered valley and by the Eastern and Western deserts.<br>
Egypt is perhaps best known as the home of the ancient Egyptian civilization, with its temples, hieroglyphs, mummies, and – visible above all – its pyramids. Less well-known is Egypt’s medieval heritage, courtesy of Coptic Christianity and Islam – ancient churches, monasteries and mosques punctuate the Egyptian landscape. Egypt stimulates the imagination of Western tourists like few other countries and is probably one of the most popular tourist destinations worldwide.</p> <p><strong>Tourism. </strong>Ever since the 2011 revolution, tourism (which provides about 15% of employment in Egypt, so one-sixth of the population are reliant upon it) has taken a major hit. Because of the downturn in tourism, expect more persistent and aggressive touts, but prices are lower and you can avoid the gigantic crowds that, at other periods, were typically overflowing the marvellous sites.<br>
The more recent counter-revolution and Military putsch, like many events of its sort, has brought repression, death sentences and imprisonment for many Egyptians (and foreign journalists) but has resulted in lower crime and reduced disruption for well-heeled foreign tourists.<br>
<strong>Climate. </strong>Egypt is largely a desert, an extension of the great Sahara that bands North Africa. Save for the thin strip of watered land along the Nile River broadening into the Nile delta, very little could survive here. Generally, the summers are hot and dry and the winters are moderate. November through March are the most comfortable months for travel in Egypt. There is almost no rain in the Nile Valley.<br>
The north coast along the Mediterranean Sea 50km southwards receives some of the most heavy rain in the country during winter months.<br>
Visitors should be aware that most houses and apartments in Cairo and Egypt do not have central heating</p> <p><strong>Money.</strong> Egyptian pound (EGP), often written as LE, (French livre égyptienne) or by using the pound sign £ with or without additional letters: E£ and £E.<br>
Hoard your small bills! Egypt has a perpetual shortage of small bills and change: even banks are reluctant to break too many bills. Vendors will also perpetually say they don’t have change and want small bills. Hoard your small bills as much as you can, be prepared to make bank runs for change, and break your bills in the easiest situations such as large supermarkets.<br>
<em><strong>Black Market Money</strong></em>. The Egyptian pound has been devaluing gradually over the last several decades. Since 2011, the exchange rate has become relatively unstable and inflation sped up. As of 2013, the Egyptian pound was worth about 11 times less than at its peak.<br>
As of late 2016, the Central Bank has attempted to fix the value of the Egyptian Pound to the US dollar at a rate of EGP1:USD17.7. This has led to a shortage of foreign exchange and as of December 2014, a black market in foreign currency emerged. Dollars attract the greatest premium. Generally, high street foreign exchange offices will offer the black market rate – the rates they publish are to a large extent fictional.<br>
<em>Exchanging money and banks. </em>In a black market economy, you can’t use banks or ATM.<br>
<em>Credit cards:</em> Debit and credit cards are generally not accepted except at hotels, large supermarkets and shopping malls targeted at foreigners.<br>
<em>Tipping.</em> Small bill tipping is encouraged as people are generally poor and tipping is a significant part of their income.<br>
<strong>Scams.</strong> A common scam of vendors, ticket sellers, taxi drivers etc. will try is to claim that you only gave him a 10LE note, when you gave him a 100LE note – this can lead to a heated argument – best to treat it as an ‘honest mistake’ so that the vendor does not lose face, then suggest that the police or tourist police can help. As a general rule whenever giving over large bills say out loud their value so both you and the vendor know the value of the notes.<br>
Shopping. In Egypt, prices are often increased for foreigners, so if you see a price on a price tag, it may be wise to learn the local Eastern Arabic numerals:</p> <p><strong>NOMAD MANIA EGYPT</strong><br>

It consists of a handle and a U-shaped metal frame, made of brass or bronze and between 30 and 76 cm in width. When shaken, the small rings or loops of thin metal on its movable crossbars produce a sound that can be from a soft clank to a loud jangling. <sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><br>
</sup><strong>Sham al-Naseem </strong>is an Egyptian national holiday marking the beginning of spring. It always falls on Easter Monday, the day after Easter. The holiday is celebrated by both Muslim Egyptians and Christian Egyptians alike, it is considered a national festival in Egypt, whose history goes back to ancient Egyptian times. The main features of the festival are: People spend all day out picnicking in any space of green, public gardens, on the Nile, or at the zoo. Traditional food eaten on this day consists mainly of <i>fesikh</i> (a fermented, salted and dried grey mullet), lettuce, scallions or green onions, and <i>termes</i>. Coloring boiled eggs, then eating and gifting them.</p> <p><strong>EGYPT – CENTRAL – Cairo, Giza, Faiyum, Beni Suef, Minya</strong><strong><em><br>
</em>Historic Cairo</strong>. World Heritage Site. Tucked away amid the modern urban area of Cairo lies one of the world’s oldest Islamic cities, with its famous mosques, <em>madrasas, hammams</em> and fountains. Founded in the 10th century, it became the new centre of the Islamic world, reaching its golden age in the 14th century.<br>
Islamic Cairo refers to the central parts around the old walled city and around the Citadel of Cairo. “Islamic” Cairo refers to the city’s rich history and heritage since its foundation in the early period of Islam, while distinguishing it from the nearby Ancient Egyptian sites of Giza and Memphis.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_1-0" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"></sup> This area holds one of the largest and densest concentrations of historic architecture in the Islamic world.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_1-1" class="reference"></sup> It is characterized by hundreds of mosques, tombs, madrasas, mansions, caravanserais, and fortifications dating from throughout the Islamic era of Egypt.<br>
The history of Cairo begins with the conquest of Egypt by Muslim Arabs in 640. The choice of this location may have been due to its slightly closer proximity to Arabia and Mecca, the fear of strong remaining Christian and Hellenistic influence in Alexandria, and Alexandria’s vulnerability to Byzantine counteroffensives arriving by sea (which did indeed occur).<sup id="cite_ref-Raymond1993_4-1" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:3_5-0" class="reference"></sup><br>
The most prominent architectural heritage of medieval Cairo, however, dates from the Mamluk period, from 1250 to 1517 AD. The Mamluk sultans and elites were eager patrons of religious and scholarly life, commonly building religious or funerary complexes whose functions could include a mosque, madrasa, khanqah (for Sufis), water distribution centers (sabils), and mausoleum for themselves and their families. Among the best-known examples of Mamluk monuments in Cairo are the huge Mosque-Madrasa of Sultan Hasan, the Mosque of Amir al-Maridani, the Mosque of Sultan al-Mu’ayyad (whose twin minarets were built above the gate of Bab Zuwayla), the Sultan Al-Ghuri complex, the funerary complex of Sultan Qaytbay in the Northern Cemetery, and the trio of monuments in the Bayn al-Qasrayn area comprising the complex of Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun, the Madrasa of al-Nasir Muhammad, and the Madrasa of Sultan Barquq.<br>
<span id="Shrines_and_mausoleums" class="mw-headline">Shrines and mausoleums. </span>al-Hussein Mosque, the Mausoleum of Imam al-Shafi’i. Some of these are in the vast cemetery areas known as the City of the Dead<br>
<span id="Citadel" class="mw-headline">Citadel. </span>Saladin began construction in 1176 on a promontory of the nearby Muqattam Hills overlooking the city. The Citadel remained the residence of the rulers of Egypt until the late 19th century<br>

</strong><strong>Wadi Al-Hitan</strong> (Whale Valley). World Heritage Site. In the Western Desert of Egypt, contains invaluable fossil remains of the earliest, and now extinct, a suborder of whales, Archaeoceti. These fossils represent one of the major stories of evolution: the emergence of the whale as an ocean-going mammal from a previous life as a land-based animal. This is the most important site in the world for the demonstration of this stage of evolution. It portrays vividly the form and life of these whales during their transition. The number, concentration and quality of such fossils here are unique, as are their accessibility and setting in an attractive and protected landscape. The fossils of Al-Hitan show the youngest archaeocetes, in the last stages of losing their hind limbs.</p> <div class="box"> <div class="icaption bordered"><a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1186/gallery/"><amp-img data-hero class="amp-wp-unknown-size amp-wp-unknown-width amp-wp-unknown-height amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://whc.unesco.org/uploads/thumbs/site_1186_0012-750-0-20151104170818.jpg" width="1000" height="400" layout="intrinsic"><amp-img fallback data-hero class="amp-wp-unknown-size amp-wp-unknown-width amp-wp-unknown-height amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://www.ronperrier.net/wp-content/plugins/accelerated-mobile-pages/images/SD-default-image.png" width="1000" height="400" layout="intrinsic"></amp-img></amp-img></a></div> <div></div> <div class="clear"><span class="acssd9f0b"><span class="acssd9f0b">The globally important fossils of Wadi Al-Hitan (Whale Valley), in the Western Desert of Egypt, provide dramatic evidence of one of the iconic stories of evolution: the emergence of whales as ocean-going mammals, from their previous life as land-based animals.<br> </span></span><span class="acssd9f0b"><span class="acssd9f0b">Only about 1,000 visitors a year drive into Wadi Al-Hitan by 4WD because the track is unpaved and crosses unmarked desert sands.<br> </span></span><span class="acssd9f0b">Visitors are restricted to prearranged guided tours along a prescribed trail.<span class="acss8af2a"> </span></span><span class="acss8af2a">Since part of Wadi Al-Hitan was made into a tourist venue, walkways between the main fossils have been laid out and small shelters built.

Its fame comes from its being the first Capital of Ancient Egypt. The unrivalled geographic location of Memphis, both commanding the entrance to the Delta while being at the confluence of important trade routes, means that there was no possible alternative capital for any ruler with a serious ambition to govern both Upper and Lower Egypt. Traditionally believed to have been founded in 3000 BC as the capital of a politically unified Egypt, Memphis served as the effective administrative capital of the country during the Old Kingdom, then during at least part of the Middle and New Kingdoms (besides Itjtawy and Thebes), the Late Period and again in the Ptolemaic Period (along with the city of Alexandria), until it was eclipsed by the foundation of the Islamic garrison city of Fustat on the Nile and its later development, Al Qahira. As well as the home of kings, and the centre of state administration, Memphis was considered to be a site sacred to the gods.<br>
The site contains many archaeological remains, reflecting what life was like in the ancient Egyptian city, which includes temples, of which the most important is the Temple of Ptah in Mit Rahina. Ptah was the local god of Memphis, the god of creation and the patron of craftsmanship. Other major religious buildings included the sun temples in Abu Ghurab and Abusir, the temple of the god Apis in Memphis, the Serapeum and the Heb-Sed temple in Saqqara. Being the seat of royal power for over eight dynasties, the city also contained palaces and ruins survive of the palace of Apries overlooking the city. The palaces and temples were surrounded by craftsmen’s workshops, dockyards and arsenals, as well as residential neighbourhoods, traces of which survive.<br>
The Necropolis of Memphis extends south and north and contains the Pyramid Complex of Saqqarathe, the first complex of monumental stone buildings in Egyptian history and royal tombs from the early shape called “mastaba” (the first pyramid ever built – the Pyramid of Djoser, or the Step Pyramid) until it reaches the pyramid shape. More than thirty-eight pyramids include the three pyramids of Giza, of which the Great Pyramid of Khufu is the only surviving wonder of the ancient world and one of the most important monuments in the history of humankind, the pyramids of Abusir, Saqqara and Dahshur, the Great Sphinx and the great statue of Rameses II at Mit Rahina. Besides these monumental creations, there are more than nine thousand rock-cut tombs, from different historical periods, ranging from the First to the Thirtieth Dynasty, and extending to the Graeco-Roman Period.</p> <p><strong>CAIRO </strong>(21.3 million). The 2nd largest in Africa and in the Arab world, and the 6th-largest in the world. Cairo is associated with ancient Egypt, as the famous Giza pyramid complex and the ancient city of Memphis are located in its geographical area. Located near the Nile Delta, Cairo was founded in 969 AD by the Fatimid dynasty, but the land composing the present-day city was the site of ancient national capitals whose remnants remain visible in parts of Old Cairo. Cairo has long been a centre of the region’s political and cultural life and is titled “the city of a thousand minarets” for its preponderance of Islamic architecture.<strong><em><br>
</em></strong></p> </div> <p>Cairo has the oldest and largest film and music industries in the Arab world, as well as the world’s second-oldest institution of higher learning, Al-Azhar University. Many international media, businesses, and organizations have regional headquarters in the city; the Arab League has had its headquarters in Cairo for most of its existence.<br>
Cairo, like many other megacities, suffers from high levels of pollution and traffic.<br>

<strong>Cairo Metro.</strong> One of the only two metro systems in Africa (the other in Algiers), and ranks amongst the fifteen busiest in the world, with over 1 billion annual passenger rides.<br>
<strong>Cairo Ramses Station. </strong>The main railway station of Cairo was originally built as the terminal of the first rail link from Alexandria to Cairo in 1856. The current building was erected in 1892 and upgraded in 1955, 2001 and 2011 (air conditioning, new marble flooring, escalators. Some critics believe these were too modern and destroyed much of the building’s original style).<br>
<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"></sup><strong>6th October Bridge </strong>is an elevated highway in central Cairo – the 20.5-kilometre  bridge and causeway crosses the Nile twice from the west bank suburbs, east through Gezira Island to Downtown Cairo, and on to connect the city to the Cairo International Airport to the east. Its name commemorates the date of ‘The Crossing’, which commenced the outbreak day of the Yom Kippur War in 1973.<br>
The bridge and causeway were completed in 1996, with construction taking nearly 30 years. It has been called the ‘spinal cord’ of Cairo, with approximately half a million Cairene people using it daily. Due to its role as Cairo’s central East-West automobile and truck route, the bridge and causeway is nearly always crowded with traffic, with the trip from one end to another taking up to 45 minutes.</p> <p><strong>Egyptian Museum. </strong>Tentative WHS (2021). Located in the heart of Tahrir Square, Cairo, the Egyptian Museum is a unique building designed to host the world’s oldest collection of Pharaonic art and monuments. Built on an area of 13,600 sq. meters, with more than 100 exhibition halls. Designed by the French architect Marcel Dourgnon, it was the first purpose-built museum with an avant-garde design.<br>
With the largest ancient Egyptian collection in the world, it has always been the flagship of museums for the study, research, conservation, and exhibition practices related to ancient Egypt and the influence it exerted on many other historical civilizations. The Museum displays an extensive collection spanning from prehistory up to the Graeco-Roman period. The museum originally contained a library, conservation laboratories, and an extra piece of land that extends to the Nile bank.<strong><em><br>

<strong>Abdeen Palace. </strong>Originally belonging to the royal family of Egypt, it is one of the official residences and the principal workplace of the President of Egypt, located above Qasr el-Nil Street in eastern Downtown Cairo.<br>
It is considered one of the most sumptuous palaces in the world in terms of its adornments, paintings, and a many clocks scattered in the parlours and wings, most of which are decorated with pure gold. Construction took from 1863-1874. Cost 700,000 Egyptian pounds, 2 million Egyptian pounds for its furnishing (18 million French francs with just one Parisian furniture manufacturer. More money was also spent on the palace’s alteration, preservation and maintenance by consecutive rulers. The palace has 500 suites.<br>
The palace today is a museum – the upper floors are reserved for visiting foreign dignitaries. The lower floors contain the Silver Museum, the Arms Museum, the Royal Family Museum, and the Presidential Gifts Museum.<br>

The 6-tier, 4-sided structure is the earliest colossal stone building in Egypt.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"></sup> It was built in the 27th century BC during the Third Dynasty for the burial of Pharaoh Djoser. The pyramid is the central feature of a vast mortuary complex in an enormous courtyard surrounded by ceremonial structures and decoration.<br>
The pyramid went through several revisions and redevelopments of the original plan. The pyramid originally stood 62.5 metres (205 ft) tall, with a base of 109 m × 121 m (358 ft × 397 ft) and was clad in polished white limestone.<br>
The step pyramid (or proto-pyramid) is considered to be the earliest large-scale cut stone construction made by man, although the nearby enclosure wall “Gisr el-Mudir” is suggested by some Egyptologists to predate the complex, and the South American pyramids at Caral are contemporary.<br>
The social implications of such a large and carefully sculpted stone structure are staggering.<sup id="cite_ref-Mark_Lehner_1997_10-0" class="reference"></sup> The process of building such a structure would be far more labor-intensive than previous monuments of mud-brick.<br>
Under the step pyramid is a labyrinth of tunnelled chambers and galleries that total nearly 6 km in length and connect to a central shaft 7 m square and 28 m deep. <sup id="cite_ref-Miroslav_Verner_1998_14-1" class="reference"></sup>These spaces provide room for the king’s burial, the burial of family members, and the storage of goods and offerings. The entrance to the 28 m shaft was built on the north side of the pyramid, a trend that would remain throughout the Old Kingdom. The sides of the underground passages are limestone inlaid with blue faience tile to replicate reed matting. On the east side of the pyramid, eleven shafts 32 m deep were constructed and annexed to horizontal tunnels for the royal harem.<br>
The burial chamber was a vault constructed of four courses of well-dressed granite. It had one opening sealed with a 3.5-ton block after the burial. No body was recovered as the tomb had been extensively robbed.<br>
The Djoser complex is surrounded by a wall of light Tura limestone 10.5 m (34 ft) high. <sup id="cite_ref-Alberto_Siliotti_1997_19-0" class="reference"></sup>Beyond the enclosure wall is a trench dug into the underlying rock. At 750 m (2,460 ft; 1,430 cu) long and 40 m (130 ft; 76 cu) wide, the trench is the largest structure of this kind in the Memphis necropolis. It is rectangular, and oriented on the north-south axis.

<strong>Pyramids of Giza. </strong>(Giza Necropolis) includes the Great Pyramid of Giza (also known as the Pyramid of Cheops or Khufu and constructed c. 2580 – c. 2560 BCE), the Pyramid of Khafre, and the modest-sized Pyramid of Menkaure, along with their associated pyramid complexes and the Great Sphinx of Giza. All were built during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of Ancient Egypt. The site also includes several cemeteries and the remains of a worker’s village. The site is at the edges of the Western Desert, approximately 9 kilometres (5.6 mi) west of the Nile River in the city of Giza, and about 13 kilometres (8 mi) southwest of the city centre of Cairo.<br>
The Great Pyramid and the Pyramid of Khafre are the largest pyramids built in ancient Egypt and one of the Seven Wonders of the World. It is by far the oldest of the Ancient Wonders and the only one still in existence.<br>
Khufu’s pyramid still has a limited number of casing stones at its base. These casing stones were made of fine white limestone quarried from the nearby range. <sup id="cite_ref-Verner_3-1" class="reference"></sup>Khafre’s pyramid, completed in 2570 BCE, appears larger than the adjacent Khufu Pyramid by virtue of its more elevated location, and the steeper angle of inclination of its construction—it is, in fact, smaller in both height and volume. Khafre’s pyramid retains a prominent display of casing stones at its apex.<br>
The sides of all three of the Giza pyramids were astronomically oriented to the north-south and east-west within a small fraction of a degree. The arrangement of the pyramids is a representation of the Orion constellation according to the disputed Orion correlation theory. A workforce of 10,000 labourers working in three-month shifts took around 30 years to build a pyramid. <sup id="cite_ref-Verner_3-7" class="reference"></sup>The complex is surrounded by a large stone wall, outside is a town where the pyramid workers were housed.<br>
<strong>Royal Necropolis of Dahshur </strong>is a royal necropolis located in the desert on the west bank of the Nile approximately 40 kilometres (25 mi) south of Cairo. It is known chiefly for several pyramids, two of which are among the oldest, largest and best preserved in Egypt, built from 2613–2589 BC.<br>
The Dahshur pyramids were an extremely important learning experience for the Egyptians. It provided them with the knowledge and know-how to transition from step-sided pyramids to smooth-sided pyramids.<br>
The first of the Dahshur pyramids was the Bent Pyramid (2613–2589 BC), built under the rule of King Sneferu. The Bent Pyramid was the first attempt at building a smooth sided pyramid but proved to be an unsuccessful build due to the miscalculations made on the structural weight that was being placed onto the soft ground (sand, gravel, and clay), which tended to subside. The block weight was not distributed appropriately, causing the angle of the pyramid to be off and achieving the name “the Bent Pyramid”.<br>
<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"></sup>Realizing his shortcomings and learning from his mistakes, King Sneferu ordered the building of the second pyramid of Dahshur, the Red Pyramid. It was 4-sided, and a free-standing pyramid rising to a height of 341 feet (104 meters), with an angle of 43 degrees.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference">[3]</sup> The Red Pyramid’s name stems from the material used to construct the pyramid, red limestone. This pyramid is believed to be the resting place of King Sneferu.<br>
<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"></sup>White Pyramid, located within Dahshur is that of the 12th Dynasty King Amenemhat II (1929–1895 BC). This pyramid has not been preserved as well.<br>
The Black Pyramid dates from the later reign of Amenemhat III and, although badly eroded, it remains the most imposing monument at the site after the two Sneferu pyramids. The polished granite pyramidion or capstone of the Black Pyramid is on display in the main hall of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.<br>

</em>Omar Makram Statue.</strong> (1750-1822) was an Egyptian political leader at the time of the 1798 French invasion (led by Napoleon) and in the subsequent political disorders. After the French withdrew in 1801, control of Egypt was nominally restored to the Ottoman Empire, but was disputed between the old Mamluk elite, Egyptian nobles, and the Ottomans. Makram allied with Muhammad Ali, the commander of Albanian troops within the army sent by the Empire to restore order.<br>
In May 1805, Egyptians led by Makram forced the Ottomans to replace the <i>Wāli</i> Ahmad Khurshid Pasha with Muhammad Ali. Makram soon discovered that Muhammad Ali planned to rule Egypt himself. Makram objected to a foreign ruler. Muhammad Ali exiled Makram to Damietta in 1809, where he stayed for four years. Makram then moved to Tanta, where he died in 1822.<br>

He served as a general in the Egyptian army. In the final year of his life, he succeeded his still-living father as ruler of Egypt and Sudan, due to the latter’s ill health. It extended over the other dominions that his father had brought under Egyptian rule, namely Syria, Hejaz, Morea, Thasos, and Crete. Ibrahim pre-deceased his father, dying only four months after acceding to the throne. Ibrahim remains one of the most celebrated members of the Muhammad Ali dynasty, particularly for his impressive military victories, including several crushing defeats of the Ottoman Empire. Among Egyptian historians, Ibrahim, his father Muhammad Ali, and his son Ismail the Magnificent are held in far higher esteem than other rulers from the dynasty, who were largely viewed as indolent and corrupt; this is largely the result of efforts by his grandson Fuad I of Egypt to ensure the positive portrayal of his paternal ancestors in the Royal Archives that he created, which were the primary source for Egyptian history from the 1920s until the 1970s.</p> <p><strong class="acssd9f0b"><em>OTHER DESTINATIONS</em></strong><br>

The campaign in the Western Desert was fought between the Commonwealth forces (with, later, the addition of two brigades of Free French and one each of Polish and Greek troops) all based in Egypt, and the Axis forces (German and Italian) based in Libya. The battlefield, across which the fighting surged back and forth between 1940 and 1942, was the 1,000 kilometres of desert between Alexandria in Egypt and Benghazi in Libya. It was a campaign of manoeuvre and movement, the objectives being the control of the Mediterranean, the link with the east through the Suez Canal, the Middle East oil supplies and the supply route to Russia through Persia. EL ALAMEIN WAR CEMETERY contains the graves of men who died at all stages of the Western Desert campaigns, brought in from a wide area, but especially those who died in the Battle of El Alamein at the end of October 1942 and in the period immediately before that.

<em>The Siyaha Festival</em>, in honour of the town’s traditional patron saint Sidi Sulayman, is unique to Siwa. Siwi children traditionally also celebrated Ashura by lighting torches, singing, and exchanging sweets. Adults’ celebration was limited to the preparation of a large meal.<br>
<strong>Homosexuality.</strong> Siwa is of special interest to anthropologists and sociologists because of its historical acceptance of male homosexuality and even rituals celebrating same-sex marriage – traditions that the Egyptian authorities have sought to repress, with increasing success, since the early twentieth century. The practice probably arose because from ancient times unmarried men and adolescent boys were required to live and work together outside the town of Shali.<br>
Although Siwan men could take up to four wives, “Siwan customs allow a man but one boy to whom he is bound by a stringent code of obligations.” In 1937 the anthropologist Walter Cline wrote the first detailed ethnography of the Siwans in which he noted: “All normal Siwan men and boys practice sodomy…among themselves, the natives are not ashamed of this; they talk about it as openly as they talk about love of women, and many if not most of their fights arise from homosexual competition….Prominent men lend their sons to each other. All Siwans know the matings which have taken place among their sheiks and their sheiks’ sons…Most of the boys used in sodomy are between twelve and eighteen years of age.” Homosexuality was not merely rampant, it was raging…Every dancer had his boyfriend…[and] chiefs had harems of boys”.<br>
In the late 1940s, Siwan women were “badly neglected”, but Siwan men “will kill each other for a boy. Never for a woman”, although as Maugham noted, marriage to a boy had become illegal by then. Now the practice is not followed.” Despite the multiplicity of sources for these practices, the Egyptian authorities and even the Siwan tribal elders have attempted to repress the historical and anthropological record. Agriculture is the main activity of modern Siwa, particularly the cultivation of dates and olives. Handicrafts like basketry are also of regional importance.<sup id="cite_ref-EBsiwa_1-7" class="reference"><br>
</sup>Tourism has in recent decades become a vital source of income. Much attention has been given to creating hotels that use local materials and display local styles. One of the main attractions is the use of eco-friendly materials and practices in the design of hotels throughout Siwa.<br>
<strong>Siwa archaeological area</strong>. Tentative WHS: (01/11/1994). Vestiges of the Past. Contains the temple of Oracle and the temple of Amun “Ubaydah” together with the different archaeological areas and monuments.<br>
The ancient fortress of Siwa, known as the Shali Ghadi was built on natural rock of salt and mud-brick and palm logs. Gradually eroded by infrequent rains and slowly collapsing, the Shali remains a prominent feature, towering five stories above the modern town and lit at night by floodlights.<br>
Other local historic sites of interest include the remains of the oracle temple; the Gebel al Mawta (the Mountain of the Dead), a Roman-era necropolis featuring dozens of rock-cut tombs;<sup id="cite_ref-EBsiwa_1-5" class="reference"></sup> and “Cleopatra’s Bath”, an antique natural spring. The fragmentary remains of the oracle temple, with some inscriptions dating from the 4th century BCE, lie within the ruins of Aghurmi. The revelations of the oracle fell into disrepute under the Roman occupation of Egypt.</p> <p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>
<strong>NILE VALLEY – LOWER EGYPT </strong>(Alexandria, Gharbia, Damietta)<strong><br>
Abu Mena.</strong> World Heritage Site. A town, monastery complex and Christian pilgrimage centre in Late Antique Egypt, about 50 km southwest of Alexandria. There are very few standing remains, but the foundations of most major buildings, such as the Great Basilica, are easily discernible. Recent agricultural efforts in the area have led to a significant rise in the water table, which has caused a number of the site’s buildings to collapse or become unstable.<br>
Menas of Alexandria was martyred in the late 3rd or early 4th century. His body was taken from Alexandria on a camel into the desert. The camel refused to continue walking, this was taken as a sign of divine will, and the body’s attendants buried it on that spot.<br>
Constantine ordered the construction of a church at the site and by the late 4th century, the baptistry, basilicas, public buildings, streets, monasteries, houses and workshops in this early Christian holy city were built over the tomb of the martyr Menas of Alexandria, who died in A.D. 296. it was a significant pilgrimage site for Christians who sought healing and other miracles. Because of crowding, three major church expansions eventually took place. Abu Mena was destroyed during the early Muslim conquests of the mid-7th century.</p> <p><strong>Alexandria, Ancient Remains and the New Library</strong>. Tentative WHS (28/07/2003). In 332 BC, Alexander the Great who was welcomed as a liberator, first went to Memphis, the capital of Pharaonic Egypt, to honour the Egyptian gods and to receive the royal investiture as Pharaoh, then to the village of Rakhotis to the west of the delta near the Mediterranean, to found Alexandria whose perimeter he drew himself and ordered his architect, Dinocrates of Rhodes, to draw up the plan. Then after only six months, he left Egypt. After he died in 322 BC, he was buried in Memphis for some time. He was then brought to Alexandria by Ptolemy for re-burial in the Sema or Soma necropolis which became that of his successors, the Ptolemy dynasty. His successors, Ptolemy I and his son Ptolemy II (285-246 BC) then the whole dynasty of the Ptolemies, developed the city, built numerous grandiose monuments and decorated it in the fashion both of the Greeks and the Egyptians.<br>
Thus in 641 AD Alexandria became a great metropolis receptive to both Egyptian and Hellenistic influences. The ancient city “Full of temples, theatres and colossal palaces, the city was magnificent, spreading five kilometres along the coast with a width of 1½ kilometres. It was surrounded by powerful fortifications and was based on an irregular quadrilateral plan. It had different quarters for the Egyptians, Greeks and Jews, as well as necropolises and residential areas. It had two ports, as the stretch of water between the coast and the <strong>island of Pharos</strong> had been divided into two by Heptastades, through an approx. 1.800 m jetty which connected the island with the land.<br>
To the east was the Portus Magnus alongside which, from the small peninsula of Lochias right up to the quarter of Bronkhion, were the <strong>palaces of the Ptolemies, the Emporium and the Caesium</strong>, the temple which Cleopatra had built in Anthony’s honour and which was completed by Augustus and consecrated for the Imperial cult. The Heliopolis obelisks which stood in front of this monument are now in London and in New York. On an island connected to the land, Anthony built the <strong>Timonion</strong>, a royal palace to which he withdrew after the defeat of Actium. At the end of the islet of Pharos stood the <strong>tower of Pharos</strong> which gave its name to the signalling system which was so useful to the navigators. In the middle of the city was the <strong>Soma</strong> or Suma, the necropolis of the Ptolemies where Alexander was buried and the <strong>Museon</strong>, a college of erudite philosophers where the famous library founded by Ptolemy I was to be found and which was enlarged by his son Ptolemy II Philadelphus and organized by Demetrios Phaleris.<br>
Alexandria, thanks to its port, rapidly became one of the great centres of commercial activity in Antiquity and replaced Tyre.<br>
The <strong>Lighthouse of Alexandria</strong> was commissioned by Ptolemy II with three superimposed elements which were square, octagonal and circular (the whole structure being over 120 m high). The lighthouse was one of the seven wonders of the world in antiquity. Its outline is known only from coins, a Byzantine mosaic discovered in Libya and the remains of a similar lighthouse in Taposiris Magna. Badly damaged due to the lack of maintenance because of Alexandria’s decline during the Byzantine era, it received a final blow during an earthquake which struck the region at the beginning of the XIIth century. The Mamelukes built in its place in the XVth century the present <strong>fort of Qayt Bey</strong> (XV century). Underwater excavations brought to light some elements which had fallen into the sea, some of which are blocks of over 50 tons which, aligned on the ground, could be part of the lighthouse’s socle.<br>
In less than a century, becoming greater than Carthage, it was deemed to be the most brilliant city after Rome where Greek culture sparkled in all its splendour. Euclides founded a school of mathematics which lasted for several centuries; there Archimedes of Syracuse made numerous discoveries. Hipparchus the father of astronomy, Eratosthenes of Cyrene, was known for his scientific geography, Heropheles the physician practised surgery there and many other scientists and scholars frequented the Museon and the library which made it famous for several centuries.<br>
<strong>The Library of Alexandria</strong> contained between 400.000 and 700.000 rolls of papyrus dealing with all the sciences. When Julius Caesar landed in Egypt, a fire partially destroyed the library. Anthony reconstituted it with 200.000 volumes from Pergamon. A slanderous legend says that it was finally burned down by the Arab conqueror Amr Ibn al-As. In reality, the “Great Library” like the palace, probably disappeared between 270 and 250 A.D. It was certainly the greatest and the richest in the ancient world where famous people from all over the world, could be met there as well as in the Museum of which it was a part. This vast structure, which included conference halls, observatories, a park, a zoo and refectories, was unique in the world”.<br>
<strong>Cleopatra</strong>, the last of the Ptolemy dynasty, was crowned in Alexandria; there she met Anthony and together they met their tragic end. The second city of the Roman empire with its 500.000 inhabitants, Alexandria enjoyed two more centuries of splendour. In 30 BC, Egypt became a Roman province. Vespasian was proclaimed emperor in Alexandria in 69 AD. Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius stayed there. Cleopatra “Between myth and reality, legend and history, the last of the Ptolemies is still full of fascination today. Daughter of Ptolemy XII, she acceded to the throne in 51 BC under the guardianship of the Roman senate represented by Pompey, at the same time as her brother and husband Ptolemy XIII. After Caesar’s death (44 BC) with whom she had a son, she seduced Mark Anthony, the new Master of the East. She won Phoenicia, Syria, Cyprus, part of Cilicia and the Nabatean Kingdom. The battle of Actium in 31 BC rang her death knoll. Octavius (the future Augustus) there defeated Anthony who, believing Cleopatra to be dead, committed suicide. Cleopatra, having first tried to seduce the victor, handed over Alexandria and then killed herself”.<br>
Christianity spread very quickly and became the State religion in 392 AD. The Byzantine emperor Theodosius II ordered the destruction of the pagan temples including the famous Serapeum of Alexandria and Diocletian ordered the whole city to be sacked. A cosmopolitan cultural centre, Alexandria greatly contributed to the success of the new religion which found philosophical sustenance there and partly drew upon the tradition of ancient Egypt until the arrival of the Moslems in 642 AD.<br>
<strong>What is there today</strong> of the ancient city? There is no lighthouse, no library, and no palaces of the Ptolemies, all have vanished. The sea near the coast conceals statues some colossal, great blocks of stones, marble or granite. Three groups:<br>
Huge monuments and structures: <strong>Pompey’s Column</strong> is a monolithic column hewn out of a single block of Aswan granite erected by Diocletian in 297 AD – 22m high, diameter 2,70 m at the base, a socle 8 m high, a huge Corinthian capital in granite which bore the equestrian statue of Diocletian until the seventh century. Two sphinxes, other Pharaonic sphinxes, statues of Ramses II and Psamtik,<br>
Ruins of the temple of Serapis, the famous Serapeum from the second century BC. Serapis, a combination of Greek and Egyptian gods and an immensely popular cult in the whole of the Mediterranean.<br>
Kom el-Dikka Site in the town centre mostly monuments from the Roman era: a theatre (the only one in Egypt), thermal baths, a cistern, a residential quarter and villas with mosaics which, within the Egyptian archeological context, are of unique value.<br>
Ancient Necropolises outside the ramparts, Mustapha Kamel hypogeum, Anfûshi necropolis has five tombs with painted walls<br>
Alexandria is in a seismic area where, from 320 AD to 1303 AD, 22 earthquakes were recorded. The rise in the sea level of about 2,6 millimetres per year submerged part of its coast with archeological remains at 6 to 8 m. Wrecks of Greek and Roman vessels, 3100 objects some over 40 tons, Pharaonic, Greek and Roman including 5 colossal, 12 m high statues from the Ptolemaic period (two of them have been lifted out) no less than 25 sphinxes (20 have been saved).<br>
<strong>Bibliotheca Alexandrina </strong>(The New Library). Modern Architecture Buildings. Inaugurated in 2002 near the sea, on a 60.000 m² surface area, an inclined cylinder a part of which disappears underground, a massive granite wall, a research centre, a library for the blind, a children’s library, an exhibition of manuscripts, an exhibition of calligraphy, maps and photography, a science museum, an astronomical research unit and other places for scientific and educational programmes, restoration laboratories and above all a beautiful archeological museum. The library can hold over one and a half million books and has areas to accommodate a great number of visitors and also possesses the best digital and computerized tools available to modern libraries.</p> <p><strong>Historic quarters and monuments of Rosetta/Rachid,</strong> Tentative WHS (28/07/2003). A small city in the Nile Delta, surrounded by water and sand renowned for its rich and varied agricultural production, especially rice which was exported by sea, and also wheat, barley, sugarcane, black grapes, oranges and dates. Open to the Mediterranean in the middle of the IXth century, to fortify against Byzantine it was built in 870 but took seven centuries until the Ottomans in 1517, to start three centuries (from the XVIth to the XIXth century)<br>
This prosperity was followed by the departure of the French Expedition (1798-1801) and the great families followed by the negligence of the civil public and even religious buildings and Rachid lost its role as the main intermediary in Egyptian inland traffic. In 1859, the Suez Canal was dug and with it the new port of Port Said was developed on the eastern Delta. The two ports, Alexandria to the west and Port Said to the east became formidable rivals against which the town could offer no resistance. The almost total obstruction of the branch of the Nile (Rachid), silting up of the port and invading dunes around the town. The great Aswan Dam aggravated the situation even more as the alluviums were no longer flushed out of the delta.<br>
Two centuries ago there were 35.000 people. Narrow streets intersecting at right angles, the last vestiges of urbanism typical of the XVIth-XVIIth centuries, lined with two- or three-storeyed houses, with mosques, hammams, oukalas… then the remains of a citadel built by Qaïtbey in 1479 where the famous Rosetta stone was found which bears an inscription in three languages, thanks to which Champollion was able to pierce the mystery of the hieroglyphs. At the beginning of the XXth century, 38 houses had been classed as historical monuments and 22 of them have survived today. A ground floor and one or two storeys, façades decorated with polychrome bricks, red, black and white, corbelling out into the street and splendid moucharabiehs (worked wood windows).<br>
<strong>Fort Julien (Fort of Qaitbey), </strong>Rasheed. On the left or west bank of the Nile about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) north-west of Rashid (Rosetta) on the north coast of Egypt, it was originally built by the Ottoman Empire and occupied by the French during Napoleon Bonaparte’s campaign in Egypt and Syria between 1798 and 1801. The fort became famous as the place where the Rosetta Stone was found in 1799.<br>
The fort is a low, squat rectangular structure with a central blockhouse that overlooks the final few kilometres of the Nile before it joins the Mediterranean Sea.</p> <p><strong>The monasteries of the Arab Desert and Wadi Natrun,</strong> Tentative WHS (28/07/2003). Arid and mountainous, the Arab Desert stretches from the Nile Valley to the Red Sea. They are about 10 km south of Zafarana, on the shore of the Red Sea (about 230 km south-east of Cairo). Wadi Natrun is a 25 km long depression in the western desert halfway between Cairo and Alexandria where there are about a dozen saline lakes, two of which, the Bouhaïret el-Gounfadiya and the Bouhaïret el-Hamra, provide natron, the sodium carbonate used by the Pharaohs for mummification.<br>
<em><strong>Monastery of St. Anthony</strong></em>. On the flank of Gabal al-Alaa al-Qibliya is the cave of St. Anthony where he lived until he died in 356 AD. The oldest monastery in Egypt. St. Anthony, with St. Pacomius (287-347 AD) was one of the first leaders of the Church, and founders of Christian monasticism. Anthony (251-356 AD) abandoned his property and retired to the Arab Desert to live there as a hermit. He chose the Gebel el Qalaa el-Qibliya to come closer to God and lived in a cave where his disciples founded a monastery.<br>
The village had a church built on top of the Saint’s tomb (XIIIth century frescoes), chapels, bread oven, mills, cells and gardens that grew up around the cave and have survived up to the present day The church, has a square narthex and a square chancel and two wheat flour mills.<br>
<em><strong>Monastery of St. Paulhe</strong></em>. Further to the west on the same mountain, this is where St. Paul lived for 60 years according to the legend at the beginning of the 4th century AD). Born in Thebaid around 225 AD, Paul became a hermit to escape from the persecutions of Christians under the emperor Decius, He crossed the desert and settled in a cave on the flank of Gabal el Qalaa el Qibliya, an inhospitable mountain scorched by the sun. He left numerous disciples behind at his death who, to perpetuate his memory, set up a community on the site of his tomb which became the nucleus of the present monastery. Smaller than St. Anthony, the St. Paul monastery had undergone less changes and today seems to be hemmed in with all its buildings within a medieval precinct. A square tower, a refuge for the monks in case of an attack, has chapels as at St. Anthony’s, and also cells, storerooms and water supplied through an underground canal from the monastery’s well. St. Paul’s church is decorated with numerous paintings from the XVIIIth century, including those of saints on horseback, namely St. George, St. Theodore and Michael the Archangel striking at the demons. On the church roof is a chapel. The church of St. Mercurius is located slightly above the St. Paul’s church.<br>
Only four out of the fifty Coptic monasteries which existed in the past have survived to the present day. One is the St. Macarius monastery (Deir Abu Makaria) 94 km southeast of Cairo and the three others, the monastery of the Romans (Deir el Baramos), the monastery of the Syrians (Deir es-Souriyan) and the St. Pshoï monastery (Deir Amba Bichoi) are 10 km away from the first monastery.<br>
The Monasteries of Natrun<br>
<strong><em>The Saint Macarius Monastery</em></strong> was Founded in the IVth century in Wadi Natrun disciples continued living as hermits, in almost total isolation. Very quickly many isolated hermits settled in the region, and then fifty monasteries were established. Four of these monasteries survived. The most important and the biggest in Wadi Natrun and Egypt is St. Macarius. Developed remarkably in the VIth century, as it was used as a refuge by the Coptic Patriarchs of Alexandria. In 866 the church was rebuilt and the ramparts consolidated so it was able to survive to the present day. An imposing tower with three floors which was used as a refuge. The relics of St. Macarius, St. John the Baptist and the prophet Elisha are fervently venerated<br>
The Church of the Forty-Nine Martyrs recalls the massacre of the monastery’s monks by desert plunderers in 444.<br>
The Monastery of St. Pschoi has five churches within a walled enclosure. St. Pschoï dates  to the IXth century<br>
The Monastery of the Syrians. 6-The Monastery of the Romans (Deir al-Baramus) The Theodore (Anba Tardus) church is no longer in use. It is next to the chapel of St. George and the St. John the Baptist church was added in the XIXth century. The three-storey tower has some vestiges from the VIIth century whilst the St. Michael church has admirable frescoes from the XIIth century.<br>
<strong>Paromeos Monastery, </strong>Wadi El Natrun. A Coptic Orthodox monastery located in Wadi El Natrun in the Nitrian Desert and the most northern among the four current monasteries of Scetes, situated around 9 km northeast of the Monastery of Saint Pishoy.<br>
The Paromeos Monastery is probably the oldest among the four existing monasteries of Scetes. It was founded c. 335 A.D. by Saint Macarius the Great. Destroyed in 407 A.D. by the Berbers, it was rebuilt and destroyed again in 410 A.D, so in 859-880 built 10-11m high walls around the monasteries of the Nitrian Desert. There were 12 monks in 1712, 9 in 1799, 30 in 1905, 35 in 1937, 20 in 1960 and 46 in 1970. Today, it has five churches. The oldest contains the relics of Saint Moses the Black.<br>
<strong>Syrian Monastery, </strong>Wadi El Natrun. Founded in the 16th century, it was occupied by Syrian monks until the 19th century. The church of the Virgin, built in about 980, which is the main church of the monastery, has a mural painting representing the Ascension, from the Xth century. From the same century is the ivory screen of the iconostasis represented religious scenes, portraits and geometric designs. Other impressive frescoes decorate the semi-cupolas of the chancel. The Church of the Holy Virgin Mary contains relics. It is close to the churches of the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste, of St. Hennis and St. Marutha (XVth century). Hundreds of old manuscripts are kept in the library of the monastery.</p> <p><strong>ALEXANDRIA </strong>(pop 5,200,000). The third-largest city in Egypt after Cairo and Giza, the seventh-largest city in Africa, and a major economic centre. The largest city on the Mediterranean – also called the “Bride of the Mediterranean” by locals – is the fourth-largest city in the Arab world and the ninth-largest urban area in Africa. The city extends about 40 km (25 mi) at the northern coast of Egypt along the Mediterranean Sea. Alexandria is a popular tourist destination, and also an important industrial centre because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez.<br>
Alexandria was founded in 331 BC by Alexander the Great, king of Macedon and leader of the Greek League of Corinth, during his conquest of the Achaemenid Empire. An Egyptian village named Rhacotis existed at the location and grew into the Egyptian quarter of Alexandria. Alexandria grew rapidly to become an important centre of Hellenistic civilization and remained the capital of Ptolemaic Egypt and Roman and Byzantine Egypt for almost 1,000 years, until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in AD 641, when a new capital was founded at Fustat (later absorbed into Cairo). Hellenistic Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria (<i>Pharos</i>), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World; its Great Library (the largest in the ancient world); and the Necropolis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages. Alexandria was the intellectual and cultural centre of the ancient Mediterranean world for much of the Hellenistic age and late antiquity. It was at one time the largest city in the ancient world before being eventually overtaken by Rome.<br>
The city was a major centre of early Christianity and the centre of the Patriarchate of Alexandria, which was one of the major centres of Christianity in the Eastern Roman Empire. In the modern world, the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria both lay claim to this ancient heritage.<br>
By the Arab conquest of Egypt in 641 AD, the city had already been largely plundered and lost its significance before re-emerging in the modern era. From the late 18th century, Alexandria became a major centre of the international shipping industry and one of the most important trading centres in the world, both because it profited from the easy overland connection between the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, and the lucrative trade in Egyptian cotton.<br>

<strong>Ruins of Tanis. </strong>An important archaeological site on the Tanitic branch of the Nile, which has long since silted up – in the northeastern Nile Delta. 1825: two pink granite sphinxes now in the Musée du Louvre; 1939: royal necropolis. Today the temple of Amun-Re has large obelisks fallen to the ground and lying in a single direction, Archaeologists have counted more than twenty.<br>
<strong>Taposiris Magna. </strong>A city established by Ptolemy II Philadelphus between 280-270 BCE. The name means “great tomb of Osiris”. After Alexander the Great conquered Egypt in 332 BC, it became a center for the religious festival of Khoiak. Role in the trade between Egypt and Libya using water transportation to the harbour and then a caravan route.<br>
Atop the Taenia ridge, an outcropping of limestone which separates the sea from Lake Maerotis, stand two monuments that were partly restored in the 1930s. One a tower used in the reconstruction of the lighthouse of Alexandria and the other is the remains of a temple of Osiris that is also believed to be the last resting place of Cleopatra.<br>
“The Tower of Abusir” was not a lighthouse or a watchtower, but a funerary monument. <sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"></sup>The necropolis shows a variety of burial styles from sarcophagi or pyramids to columns or pilasters.

<strong>Cecil Hotel. </strong>Hospitality Legends. Four-star Steigenberger Cecil Hotel was built in 1929 by the Metzger family as a romantic hotel, at Saad Zaghloul Square where Cleopatra’s needles had been, in front of the Corniche. Author Somerset Maugham stayed here, as did Winston Churchill and Al Capone. Moreover, the British Secret Service maintained a suite for their operations. It was seized by the Egyptian government after the revolution in 1952, and five years later the Metzger family was expelled from the country. In 2007, after a lengthy court battle, legal ownership of the hotel was returned to the Metzger family, who subsequently sold it to the Egyptian government. It operated for many years as the Sofitel Cecil Alexandria Hotel, until it joined the Steigenberger Hotels chain in 2014.<br>
<strong>Délices. </strong>Hospitality Legends. This old tea room has been in business since 1922 and is <em>the</em> place to come for tea and cake. Although much of its original grandeur has been scrubbed away, its high-ceilinged halls still exude a sense of old-world atmosphere. The patisserie here once supplied Egypt’s royalty and the cafe was a favourite haunt of Allied soldiers during WWII.<br>
On a hot day, order the specialty Deliccino drink (ice cream and espresso milkshake). There’s also a full menu of crêpes, pasta and sandwiches. One area has been turned into a hipper, air-conditioned cafe, very popular with local women.<br>
<strong>Trianon. </strong>Hospitality Legends. Admire the 1930s grandeur of its sensational ornate ceiling and faded but still glorious wall panels. Grab a slice of something from the patisserie selection, order a juice or a coffee, and soak up the historic atmosphere. Part of the cafe is a restaurant serving Mediterranean food, with mediocre pizzas but better plates of pasta. Trianon was a favourite haunt of the Greek poet Cavafy, who worked in offices on the floor above.</p> <p><strong>DO</strong><br>
