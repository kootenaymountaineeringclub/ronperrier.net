But it appeared to be the only hotel in the city.</em><br /> <strong>Bhir Mound</strong> is the earliest historic city of Taxila and was probably founded in the 6th century BC by the Achaemenians. Its stone walls, house foundations, and winding streets represent the earliest forms of urbanization on the subcontinent. Bihr is also associated with Alexander the Great’s triumphant entry into Taxila in 326 BC.<br /> Today all that is visible is a 5 m high long grassy mound with no signs, office or anything. There are many artifacts in the Taxila Museum from Bhir. Free<br /> <strong>Sirsukh.</strong> I could find nothing here after walking all around in the area marked by Google Maps.<br /> <strong>Taxila Museum.</strong> This very good archaeological museum has artifacts from the WHS of Taxila, mostly from Sirkap, Bhir, and various Buddhist monasteries in the area. Most of the pieces were either Buddhist or of Greek origin with literally hundreds of Buddha images in stone, limestone, or stucco. I was given a guided tour. 500 PR<br /> <strong><br /> TAXILA</strong> World Heritage Site. From the ancient Neolithic tumulus of Saraikala to the ramparts of Sirkap (2nd century B.C.) and the city of Sirsukh (1st century A.D.), Taxila illustrates the different stages in the development of a city on the Indus that was alternately influenced by Persia, Greece and Central Asia and which, from the 5th century B.C. to the 2nd century A.D., was an important Buddhist centre of learning.<br /> Taxila, located in the Rawalpindi district of Pakistan’s Punjab province, is a vast serial site that includes a Mesolithic cave and the archaeological remains of four early settlement sites, Buddhist monasteries, and a Muslim mosque and madrassa. Situated strategically on a branch of the Silk Road that linked China to the West, Taxila reached its apogee between the 1st and 5th centuries. It is now one of the most important archaeological sites in Asia.<br /> The prehistoric <strong>mound of Saraikala</strong> represents the earliest settlement of Taxila, with evidence of Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Iron Age occupation.<br /> <strong>Sirkap</strong> was a fortified city founded during the mid-2nd century BC. The many private houses, stupas, and temples were laid out on the Hellenistic grid system and show the strong Western classical influence on local architecture. The city was destroyed in the 1st century by the Kushans, a Central Asian tribe. Part of the 500 PR fee.<br /> All that remains is a large site of low foundation walls and the remains of a stupa.<br /> <strong>Dharmirajika</strong> is the third major part of the WHS. It consists of the remains of huge stupa, 74 other stupas, a lying Buddha, and the feet of a standing Buddha.<br /> 500 PR covers three archaeological sites.</p><p><strong>RAWALPINDI. </strong>Commonly known as Pindi, is the fourth-largest city in Pakistan. Rawalpindi is adjacent to Pakistan’s capital of Islamabad, and the two are jointly known as the “twin cities” on account of strong social and economic links between the cities.<br /> Rawalpindi is located on the Pothohar Plateau, known for its ancient Buddhist heritage, especially in the neighbouring town of Taxila – a UNESCO World Heritage Site. ]<br /> In 1765, it came under Sikh rule and eventually became a major city within the Sikh Empire based in Lahore. The city was conquered by the British Raj in 1849, and in 1851 became the largest garrison town of the British Indian Army. Following the partition of British India in 1947, the city became home to the headquarters of the Pakistan Army hence retaining its status as a major military city.<br /> The construction of Pakistan’s new purpose-built national capital city of Islamabad in 1961 led to greater investment in the city. Modern Rawalpindi is socially and economically intertwined with Islamabad. The city is also home to numerous suburban housing developments that serve as bedroom communities for workers in Islamabad. As home to GHQ of Pakistan Army &amp; Benazir Bhutto International Airport, and with connections to the M-1 and M-2 motorways, Rawalpindi is a major logistics and transportation centre for northern Pakistan. The city is also home to historic havelis and temples and serves as a hub for tourists visiting Rohtas Fort, Azad Kashmir, Taxila, and Gilgit-Baltistan.<br /> <strong>Pakistan Army Museum. </strong>After endless bureaucracy, I finally gained entry – lots of weapons. I went to the gate signed where there were 7 army personnel. After 10 minutes and a few phone calls, we were directed to the gate on the opposite side. When I went to purchase the ticket after talking to one of the 6 people there, the ticket seller said that the museum was closed because of Covid!!! What do all these people do all day? 50 PR<br /> <strong>Rawalpindi Station. </strong>In a lovely old, yellow stone building, the lobby was virtually empty, reflecting the fact that few Pakistanis travel by train, much more often by bus. The passenger cars were relics from the past.<br /> <em>Driving through this part of Pindi was a bedlam of people walking on the street (because the sidewalks are blocked), motorcycles, rickshaws, and people pushing large carts full of merchandise.</em> <em>Being ahead gives one the right of way, so aggression (which Sadik doesn’t have) counts.</em><br /> <strong>Raja Bazaar. </strong>This market is a warren of tiny lanes inside one huge market like the rest of Pakistan. It is hard to know where the “market” ends and starts.<br /> <strong>Lal Haveli</strong>. is a famous Haveli (residence) as well as the political centre for the Pakistani politician Sheikh Rashid Ahmad. It is located in the central part of old Rawalpindi near the Raja Bazaar.<br /> The haveli was built by Dhan Raj Sehgal who left for India leaving the Haveli to his mistress Budhan Bai and thence it is said to have been the abode of that woman before the independence of Pakistan. Saigol had a Masjid and a Temple built within the confines of his Haveli, a masjid for the woman and a temple for himself. The woman left the place for good when her brother was murdered here.<br /> Sheikh Rasheed used to be a bookseller in this area at the time, his place of business being just a few meters from the front entrance. It is said that his infatuation with the grand building and its owner led him to buy the building later on in his life when he had the means to do so.<br /> It is now the residence of the Interior Minister of Pakistan and can&#8217;t be visited.</p><p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="low-res-photo" style="font-size: 12px;" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4142/5220248441_2a786642c3_n.jpg" alt="Lal Haveli Rawalpindi | by Tayyab Mir" width="620" height="465" /></p><p><strong>Gulshan Dadan Khan Mosque. </strong>Thankfully this was on the border of Islamabad and the traffic moved on the way there, well sort of.

The city is one of the safest in Pakistan, and has an expansive RFID-enabled surveillance system with almost 2000 CCTV cameras.<br /> Islamabad is a marked distinction from the rest of Pakistan: wide streets separated by boulevards planted with flowers and bushes, many parks, palatial houses and no traffic. It could not be more different than its twin city, Rawalpindi, which is more chaotic than usual.<br /> The following four sites are in a huge natural park in the SW of Islamabad.<br /> The many street lights must drive the locals crazy as each side moves individually, making them very slow often with no traffic moving. <sup><br /> </sup><strong>Golra Sharif Railway Museum. </strong>In a bucolic setting, this no longer active station was built in 1871.

Rohtas Fort, also called Qila Rohtas, is a strategic site in the north of Pakistan and an exceptional example of early Muslim military architecture in Central and South Asia. Rohtas Fort is unique: there are no surviving examples on the subcontinent of military architecture of this period on the same scale and with the same degree of completeness and preservation.<br /> Sher Shah Suri, the celebrated Afghan military leader who established the Sur Empire in India by dethroning the Mughal emperor Humayun in 1541, built a strong fortified complex at Rohtas, a strategic site on the crossroads of the Punjab plains, Himalayan foothills, and Potochar Plateau. It is on the main route of the famous Grand Trunk Road connecting Bengal on the east with the Peshawar Valley in the west and is ideally suited to control the movement of armies, people, and goods through the narrow path in the Salt Range.<br /> Suri had a great passion for building forts, mosques, roads, and inns and many of his extensive public works laid the physical boundaries for the later Mughal empire.<br /> It is perched on jagged cliffs over a verdant valley. Engineered to withstand gunpowder warfare which had arrived in India with Babur and his Turkish cannons it is perched on jagged rock faces protected by deep ravines on all sides. It could hold 30,000 troops. With walls as high as 20 and 12m thick, it was never taken by storm and has survived intact to the present day. The main 70-hectare fortifications consist of more than four kilometres of massive masonry walls, lined with 68 bastions and pierced at strategic points by 12 monumental gateways.<br /> It follows the contours of its hilltop site. An interior wall partitions the inner citadel from the remainder of the fort, and an internal water supply in the form of <em>baolis</em> (stepped wells) gave the fort’s garrison self-sufficiency in water. A beautiful mosque known as Shahi Masjid is situated near the Kabuli Gate, and the Haveli (Palatial House) Man Singh was constructed later in the Mughal period. Based essentially on Turkish military architecture developed in reaction to the introduction of gunpowder and cannon, it also transformed into a distinct style of its own.<br /> Sophistication and high artistic value of its decorative elements, notably its high- and low-relief carvings, its calligraphic inscriptions in marble and sandstone, its plaster decoration, and its glazed tiles.<br /> The garrison complex was in continuous use until 1707 and then reoccupied under the Durrani and Sikh rulers of the 18th and 19th centuries respectively. A village grew within the walls and exists day.<br /> This fort is truly impressive. From some good viewpoints on walking around the fort, the walls extend “all over the place”. Most structures other than the walls have little standing. The exception is the Haveli of Raja Man Singh (Mughal Emperor Akbar’s general) with two domes on top of each other, but even it is a vestige of what was once here. 500 PR</p><p><noscript><img decoding="async" class="main-photo" style="font-size: 12px;" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/5343/8997588688_fd5b193a44_z.jpg" alt="Rohtas Fort | by Nadeem Khawar." width="619" height="413" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload main-photo" style="font-size: 12px;" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20619%20413%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://live.staticflickr.com/5343/8997588688_fd5b193a44_z.jpg" alt="Rohtas Fort | by Nadeem Khawar." width="619" height="413" /></p><p><em>The drive west to the next sites was on “dream roads”, a 4-lane divided highway with virtually no traffic, not even congested towns.</em></p><p><strong>Katas Raj Temples,</strong> Chatwal.

Around this pond, temples were built dedicated to the Hindu deities Shiva, Ram, and Hunaman. Situated in Punjab’s Salt Range near Kallar Kahar (at an altitude of 2,000 feet), the Katas Raj Temple complex is considered the second-most sacred shrine in Hinduism. The pond from the Hindu legend occupies an area of two canals and 15 marlas, with a maximum depth of 20 feet.<br /> The seven temples at Katas — believed to have been built around 650 and 950 AD — are connected by walkways. The name of the temple complex is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘kataksha’ which means ‘tearful eyes’ and every spring and autumn, Hindu pilgrims from Pakistan and India visit the pond to bathe in it and ‘wash off their sins’.</p><p><em>The 19 km drive to the salt mines traversed very rugged terrain, basically along a ridge between two deep canyons – and on easily the worst road driven so far in Pakistan. It took an hour.<br /> </em><br /> <strong>The Salt Range and Khewra Salt Mine</strong> Tentative WHS (12/04/2016). Rising abruptly from the Punjab plains west of the River Jhelum and ending equally precipitously on the Indus River, one hundred and eighty kilometres in the west, the Salt Range is a long linear formation of sheer escarpments, jagged peaks, rolling hills, and desolate ravines. Nestling between these hills are fertile valleys scattered with lakes and irrigated by spring-fed streams. The Salt Range originated 800 million years ago when the evaporation of a shallow sea followed by the underthrusting of the Indian Plate formed a range that stretched for about 300 kilometres. The range derives its name from the occurrence of the thickest seams of rock salt in the world embedded in the Precambrian bright red marls of the Salt Range Formation. The Salt Range constitutes a narrow zone of localized strong folding, faulting, and uplift, in contrast to the open folds of low structural relief in the Potwar Plateau and no deformation at all in the immediately adjacent Punjab Plain.<br /> It represents an open book of geology with richly fossiliferous stratified rocks, all excellently exposed due to lack of vegetation. The exposure shows tectonic features and a diverse range of floral and faunal fossils including well-preserved complete body fossils of invertebrate and vertebrate fauna, their skeletal grains, faunal moulds, and castes along with a large variety of ichnofossils.<br /> Hominidae remains have been found. Hundreds of edged pebble tools were discovered dated to 500,000 – 125,000 bp).<br /> Historical sites date from the 4th c. when Alexander the Great fought his last battle with Raja Porus at the bank of Jehlum River, through the Hindu Shahi period, the Mughal Empire to the era of Sikh rule and the British Colonial occupation. Fortresses, monasteries, and temple complexes such as Kafirkot and Malot (9th – 19th c.), Nandna, Tilla Jogian, and the World Heritage site of Rohtas perch on high mountain platforms overlooking important passes through the Salt Range.<br /> Habitation sites and ancient centers of religious pilgrimage such as Katas Raj and Mari Indus, early Mughal sites such as Takht-e-Babri, the throne of Emperor Babar and his Bagh-e-Safa considered to be the first Mughal Garden in Asia, are found in Kallar Kahar in the middle of the Salt Range.<br /> Step wells, stone-lined tanks, sacred ponds and banyans (Ficus indica), and groves spanning many periods are scattered across the landscape.<br /> <em>Khanpur cave,</em> which has produced stratified microlithic tools of the Mesolithic period, and some Buddhist monasteries and stupas of various periods. Buddhist monuments erected throughout the Taxila valley transformed it into a religious heartland and a destination for pilgrims from as far afield as Central Asia and China. The Buddhist archaeological sites at Taxila include the Dharmarajika complex and stupa, the Khader Mohra grouping, the Kalawan grouping, the Giri monasteries, the Kunala stupa and monastery, the Jandial complex, the Lalchack, and the Badalpur stupa remains and monasteries, the Mohra Moradu monastic remains, the Pipplian and the Jaulian remains, and the Bahalar stupa and remains. The Giri complex also includes the remains of a three-domed Muslim mosque, ziarat (tomb), and madrassa (school) of the medieval period.<br /> <strong>Khewra Salt Mines</strong>, Located near Kallar Kahar about 160 kilometres from Islamabad and 260 kilometres from Lahore are the world’s second-largest salt mine. A tourist train runs inside the mine tunnels and passes through some incredible sculptures &amp; structures made up of salt. There is also a twelve-bed therapy centre inside the mine called the Khewra Asthma Clinic, which has the reputation of having healing powers owing to the health benefits of its micro-climate. Shops inside the mine sell crafted lamps, sculptures and ornaments made up of salt.<br /> The fee for a foreigner to visit the mine is a whopping US$20 (~3600 PR) with no senior discount (400 PR for Pakistan residents, 200 if over 65) plus 200 to take the train to tour the mine.<br /> Walk down to the mine shaft and then approximately .5 km along a narrow tunnel on a foot-beaten uneven dirt path beside the train track. The walls are reinforced with brick, stone or concrete pillars and there is nothing to see here. At a Y, follow the track to the right and pass several excavated galleries each with water (there is nothing of interest here either). At the end of the track, the route turns left to enter a U-shaped, pedestrian-only tunnel. Here there are 5 constructed “attractions”, all lame and made with bricks of salt backlit by lights: a mosque, an office, a tiny platform with a cannon, a tower, and a waterfall. None are interesting. Just before rejoining the track is the most interesting place with wonderful hard salt crystal walls and a few tunnels where the pink to red coloured crystal is very nice. The ground is very uneven foot-packed earth. Return back down the entrance tunnel.<br /> I have been to two large salt mines in Europe and this one doesn’t remotely compare. Those have large open galleries, wonderful salt crystal sculptures, and bas reliefs carved into the walls. It is certainly not worth US$20, more like the $2.50 the locals pay. Certainly, avoid the train, a mickey mouse affair that avoids seeing the U-shaped walking part, the only thing worth seeing. The train is generally packed with Pakistanis. 3600 PR for foreigners.</p><p><em>We then drove directly towards Lahore. The initial 20 km was on a disastrous pot-holed mess of a road.

Constructed in brick, the minar (tower) constructed in 1607, is circular and tapers towards the top, which is flat, with a parapet wall. There are 210 square holes on the outer surface of the minar, arranged at regular intervals in ~ 14 rows. A spiral staircase consisting of 108 steps has been provided inside the minar. Alongside the staircase, there are 11 ascending rectangular arched openings provided for air and light. The minar is divided into six tiers of different heights. The base of each tier has projected molding and the lowest tier has an arched opening for an entrance. The entire exterior, as well as the interior of the minar, has lime plaster, apparently with some floral or lineal fresco paintings. The thick lime plaster applied over the surface of the lowest tier has been divided into decorative panels or arched niches and horizontal bands in high relief.<br /> Facing the grand minar on the east side is a big tank constructed in 1627 with a causeway leading to the octagonal baradari (pavilion) built in the middle There is a square pavilion at each corner with a gateway to the baradari. The tank is rectangular in shape, 895’ by 792’, each side has a ramp and a parapet wall and is flanked by four staircases of 8 steps. During the Mughal days, a channel was cut from the Aik rivulet and connected with the tank at its northwest corner; in addition, an elaborate system for filling up the tank with rainwater from the catchment area was devised.<br /> A causeway, standing on 21 pointed arched pillars, connects the main baradari with the gateway. In the centre of the tank has been erected an octagonal platform with a low parapet wall on all sides. Over the platform stands the beautiful baradari in the same plan, The baradari was constructed under the orders of Emperor Jahangir in 1620 A.D. for use as a royal residence.<br /> I was surprised that this was open on a Friday morning. It is in a very peaceful place outside of the chaos of the city. The tank is truly huge and has paddleboats. Both gates to the causeway and the minar were locked. 500 PR</p><p><noscript><img decoding="async" class="nw pt ef es eo ex w c" role="presentation" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*csRUrquUn3jQSkyq5W5Jig.png" sizes="700px" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/276/1*csRUrquUn3jQSkyq5W5Jig.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*csRUrquUn3jQSkyq5W5Jig.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/640/1*csRUrquUn3jQSkyq5W5Jig.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*csRUrquUn3jQSkyq5W5Jig.png 700w" alt="" width="619" height="384" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload nw pt ef es eo ex w c" role="presentation" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20619%20384%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*csRUrquUn3jQSkyq5W5Jig.png" data-sizes="700px" data-srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/276/1*csRUrquUn3jQSkyq5W5Jig.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*csRUrquUn3jQSkyq5W5Jig.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/640/1*csRUrquUn3jQSkyq5W5Jig.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*csRUrquUn3jQSkyq5W5Jig.png 700w" alt="" width="619" height="384" /><br /> <strong><br /> Sheikhpura Fort.</strong> This is a massive fort constructed of brick with high walls and many guard towers.

The city was captured by the forces. Lahore eventually became the capital of the Sikh Empire in the early 19th century and regained some of its lost grandeur. Lahore was central to the independence movements of both India and Pakistan. Lahore experienced some of the worst rioting during the Partition period preceding Pakistan’s independence.<br /> Lahore is a major center for Pakistan’s publishing industry and remains the foremost center of Pakistan’s literary scene. The city is also a major centre of education in Pakistan with some of Pakistan’s leading universities based in the city. Lahore is also home to Pakistan’s film industry, Lollywood, and is a major centre of <em>Qawwali</em> music. The city also hosts much of Pakistan’s tourist industry, with major attractions including the Walled City, the famous Badshahi and Wazir Khan mosques, as well as several Sikh and Sufi shrines.<br /> Lahore has bad pollution &#8211; all the vehicles but mainly from all the brick kilns that belch a lot of smoke.

At the four corners, there are square minarets surmounted by pseudo-pavilions of red sandstone with white marble cupolas. At the four corners of the courtyard are the tall octagonal minars (towers). Four smaller minarets, also octagonal, are attached to the corners of the prayer chamber. Above them rise three grand bulbous marble domes. The red sandstone of the building is decorated externally with unobtrusive lines and patterns in white marble inlay. The embellishment of the prayer chamber in the interior and exterior with Zanjira interlacing and flowers with their spidery tendrils, treated in bold relief, is a unique work of unsurpassed beauty and workmanship in Mughal architecture.
