It was relatively easy to get to the last step, but the system would not accept my credit cards for payment. I contacted my bank, but there were no attempts even made to make a billing. As a result, I canceled my hotel in Jeddah and decided to go to Egypt.<br /> I had also considered Algeria but apparently, I could only obtain an Algeria visa in my home country. I plan on checking this out when I arrive in Cairo, but have still decided to stay in Egypt for the 3 weeks until my completely arranged trip to Iraq. </em></p><p><em>On Oct 24, I flew from Larnaca, Cyprus to Cairo on Middle Eastern Airlines. I had a 10-hour layover in Beirut and slept in the airport. One must transit if there for less than 24 hours. My pack had not been transferred so I was worried that it would not make it to Cairo. As I had no access to it (available after immigration, which was not possible), I didn’t have my usual sleeping-in-airports gear – mat, sleep sheet, sleeping bag, backpack pillow. All the thousands of seats in departures have no arms so it is easy to be comfortable without a mat. But the overhead announcements seemed non-stop. There is an all-night coffee shop with a large smoking area – very unusual. I wrote this at 3am in the coffee shop.<br /> It must be the busiest airport in the world overnight! I have never seen more people in an airport at night (and I sleep in a lot of airports). Virtually all are Muslim and there were a lot of kids up throughout the night.<br /> </em><em>My flight arrived in Cairo at 08:20 and I caught the airport shuttle into downtown Cairo where my hostel was. I stayed at the Deluxe Australian Hostel. – all single beds in small 4-bed dorms at possibly the least I have ever paid for a hostel.<br /> I was able to get my lost MC credit card couriered here, a big relief.<br /> I was quite excited about Cairo and Egypt. Cairo is the last of my 25 biggest cities in the world and the pyramids at Giza, the last of the Seven Wonders of the World. These are some big ticks. And I decided to spend 3 full weeks here until my potential trip to Yemen. </em></p><p><strong>Money:</strong> 1 euro – 18.25 Egyptian pounds (EGP)</p><p>Some observations about Egypt<br /> 1. Cairo reminded me immediately of India &#8211; &#8220;organized chaos&#8221; &#8211; blaring horns, lots of traffic (but few tuk-tuks), crossing streets through moving traffic, garbage everywhere, smells. Replace burqas and headscarves with saris, have cows roaming the streets, and they appear very similar. They are all &#8220;brown&#8221; people.<br /> 2. Covid rules. Almost no one wears masks anywhere. Even on domestic flights, half the passengers didn&#8217;t have a mask. That occurs nowhere else that I have been. When I asked the stewardess about it, they said &#8220;you can&#8217;t force people to wear masks&#8221;. But every other airline does force their passengers to wear masks.<br /> Getting a Covid PCR is very expensive in Cairo &#8211; 1230 LE.<br /> 3. The roads are all very good and I didn&#8217;t see one pothole in any road. The coastal highway on the Sinai is totally overbuilt with a 6-lane divided highway and virtually no traffic. I drove at 160 km/hour for the entire distance.<br /> 4. Security checks are everywhere. Just like in China to enter anything requires a pass through a bag scanner and metal detector. To board the plane in Sharm El Sheikh required a complete body search twice.<br /> 5. Egyptian food is underwhelming. Fast food places and small snack shops are common.<br /> 6. Costs. Egypt is very cheap. The hostels are 7 €. You can eat well for 3 €. Domestic flights are cheap &#8211; 50€ to fly from Sharm El Sheikh to Cairo.<br /> 7. Getting around. Try to avoid taxis as they are very expensive and the drivers difficult to bargain with. Use Uber whenever possible &#8211; getting from the airport into town was 350 LE by taxi and 141 LE by Uber.<br /> The metro in Cairo was easy to use and good for some destinations.<br /> The minivans are great to use as they are ubiquitous on main roads. Rides are 1-10 LE depending on destination. The drivers never speak English and other passengers are often the only source of info. Put a walking route into Google Maps, follow it along and find out where to get off.<br /> Avoid tuk-tuks at all cost. I had nothing but bad experiences.</p><p><em>On arrival at Cairo Airport (CAI),</em> <em>first, visit one of the three banks just before passport control and pay the US$25 fee in cash only.. It is best to have exact change. I used the Bank of Egypt and he made change for Euros. Passport control is very fast. I was able to replace the half-page sticker over a damaged area that resulted from me removing my Afghan visa. 18 km NE of the city, there are only taxis to take you into town.</em></p><p><strong>CAIRO<br /> </strong>Cairo reminds me very much of India &#8211; loud, traffic, lots of horning, crossing streets with moving traffic, garbage, unfinished construction, and lots of people. It is easier to walk on the road than on the sidewalk. Everything is covered with a fine layer of dirt so all have a &#8220;grimey&#8221; look. It is common to see horse-drawn carts used to haul freight and vegetables.<br /> <strong>Yacoubian Building</strong> is famous as a novel by Egyptian author Alaa-Al-Aswany. The book was made into a film of the same name in 2006 and into a TV series in 2007. Published in Arabic in 2002 and in an English translation in 2004, the book, ostensibly set in 1990 at about the time of the first Gulf War, is a <em>roman à clef</em> and scathing portrayal of modern Egyptian society since the Revolution of 1952. The locale of the novel is downtown Cairo, with the titular apartment building (which actually exists) serving as both a metaphor for contemporary Egypt and a unifying location in which most of the primary characters either live or work and in which much of the novel&#8217;s action takes place. The author, a dentist by profession, had his first office in the Yacoubian Building in Cairo.<br /> The actual namesake building, constructed in the Art Deco style, still stands in downtown Cairo at the address given in the novel: 34, Talaat Harb Street (referred to by its old name, Suleiman Pasha Street, by both native Cairenes and the novel&#8217;s characters), although its true appearance differs from its description in the book. Al Aswany writes of its fictional counterpart as having been designed <em>&#8220;in the high classical European style, the balconies decorated with Greek faces carved in stone, the columns, steps, and corridors all of natural marble.&#8221;<br /> </em><strong>Maspero Television Building</strong> is the name of the huge building on the bank of the Nile river. It is the headquarters of the Egyptian Radio and Television Union (formerly the Arab Radio and Television Union, the oldest state-run broadcasting organisation in the Arab World and Africa. Maspero is also the name of the street, which this building overlooks.<br /> <strong>Carriage Museum</strong> (Royal Chariots Museum)<br /> Nile River. I crossed the river on a large bridge and visited these three on the west bank.<br /> <strong>Cairo Marriott Hotel.</strong> In the NM series Architectural Delights, The Cairo Marriott Hotel is a large hotel located in the Zamalek district of Gezira Island. It is one of the tallest buildings in Cairo. The Marriott opened in 1982, but its central wing was built as the Gezirah Palace for the Khedive Isma&#8217;il Pasha in 1869 and converted to a luxury hotel in 1894.<br /> The hotel consists of 1,087 rooms, making it one of the largest hotels in the Middle East. The rooms are located in two identical twenty-story buildings—the Gezira and Zamelek Towers. Situated between them on the ground level are the palace and the main entrance to the hotel.<br /> The Gezirah Palace was built to host French Emperor Napoleon III and his wife Empress Eugénie during the celebration of the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. During World War I, the hotel served as the No.2 Australian General Hospital, after the Mena House was unable to cope with the huge number of casualties from the Battle of Gallipoli. The palace was nationalized by Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1952 and eventually converted back to a hotel, reopening in 1962 as the Omar Khayyam Hotel. In the late 1970s, the two large towers were added and the entire hotel was completely rebuilt. President Hosni Mubarak presided over the grand reopening in 1982 as the Cairo Marriott Hotel.<br /> <strong>Prince Amr Ibrahim Palace.</strong> In the NM series Architectural Delights, is a historical building in Cairo&#8217;s Zamalek island, which is used as Egypt&#8217;s first ceramics museum, the Museum of Islamic Ceramics and as an art center.<br /> It was built on the orders of Prince Amr Ibrahim (1903–1977), a member of the Muhammad Ali dynasty, in 1921. Prince Amr Ibrahim was the husband of Necla Sultan, granddaughter of Ottoman ruler Mehmed VI. The architectural style of the palace is of neo-Ottoman and of the neo-Islam. In the entrance hall, there is a marble fountain decorated with blue ceramics.<sup>[1]</sup> The palace is surrounded by a 2,800 square meter garden.<br /> The Museum of Islamic Ceramics is in the Prince Amr Ibrahim Palace. As of January 2019 it was closed for restoration for at least 2 years.<br /> <strong>Cairo Tower.</strong> In the NM series Architectural Delights, is a free-standing concrete tower. At 187 m (614 ft), it is the tallest structure in Egypt and North Africa. It was the tallest structure in Africa for ten years until 1971, when it was surpassed by Hillbrow Tower in South Africa.<br /> One of Cairo&#8217;s well-known modern monuments sometimes considered Egypt&#8217;s second most famous landmark after the Pyramids of Giza, it stands in the Gezira district on Gezira Island in the River Nile, close to downtown Cairo.<br /> Its partially open lattice-work design is intended to evoke a pharaonic lotus plant, an iconic symbol of Ancient Egypt.<sup>[8]</sup> The tower is crowned by a circular observation deck and a revolving restaurant that rotate around its axis occasionally with a view over greater Cairo.<br /> Between 2006 and 2009, the tower underwent an EGP 15 million restoration project that included a new installation of light decoration.<br /> <strong>Qasr El Nil Bridge.</strong> A busy 4-land road bridge crossing the Nile, it ends on Tahir square.<br /> <strong>Omar Makram Statue.</strong> (1750-1822) was an Egyptian political leader at the time of the 1798 French invasion and in the subsequent political disorders.<br /> Makram was born in 1750 in Asyut. He was educated at Al-Azhar University and became a leader of the nobles of Egypt and an Egyptian national hero. He was prominent in resistance to the 1798 invasion of Egypt by France (led by Napoleon).<br /> After the French withdrew in 1801, control of Egypt was nominally restored to the Ottoman Empire, but in fact was disputed between the old Mamluk elite, Egyptian nobles, and the Ottomans. Makram allied with Muhammad Ali, the commander of Albanian troops within the army sent by the Empire to restore order. In May 1805, Egyptians led by Makram forced the Ottomans to replace the <em>Wāli</em> Ahmad Khurshid Pasha with Muhammad Ali. Makram soon discovered that Muhammad Ali planned to rule Egypt himself. Makram objected to a foreign ruler. Muhammad Ali exiled Makram to Damietta on 9 August 1809, where he stayed for four years. Makram then moved to Tanta, where he died in 1822.<br /> This large bronze sits on one corner of Tahir square.<br /> <strong>Tahrir Square.</strong> Really a large, busy roundabout centered on an obelisk, this is made square with grassy parks in each corner.<br /> <strong>Ethnographic Museum.</strong><br /> <strong>Cafe Riche.</strong> Established in 1908, it is a small restaurant with about 14 tables and lots of character. The owner sits at a desk at the entrance. It has a huge variety of reasonably priced food. We ate there and the food was very mediocre.<br /> <strong>Gezirah Palace Hotel</strong> (Pharaohs Palace). Presently covered with scaffold, the exterior is undergoing a major renovation.<br /> <strong>Statue of Ibrahim Pasha</strong> (Talaat Harb Statue). Stands in the center of a roundabout surrounded by Cairo’s best architecture<br /> <strong>Townhouse Gallery.</strong> When the second owner recently died, it was purchased and renamed Access Artists Centre. He sells art on commission. There was a lot of very nice Cairo art here. Free</p><p><u>Day 2</u><br /> <strong>Egyptian Museum.</strong> This large 2-story museum has a lot to see, it is not organized by era, many things are not labeled and it is impossible to keep all the kingdoms, dynasties, pharaohs, queens, priests, and many others that had elaborate funeral arrangements. But there are a lot of amazing things to see. Most people had guides but I think going alone and reading what you want is best.<br /> The highlights were the Tomb of Yuya &amp; Thury with gilt coffins and furniture, the Bab el’Gurus Tomb discovered in 1891, and the throne of Tutankhamen. 200<br /> <strong>Museum Of Modern Egyptian Art</strong>.

A nilometer was a structure for measuring the Nile River&#8217;s clarity and water level during the annual flood season. There were three main types of nilometers, calibrated in Egyptian cubits: (1) a vertical column, (2) a corridor stairway of steps leading down to the Nile, or (3) a deep well with a culvert. If the water level was low, there would be less food. If it was too high, it would be destructive. There was a specific mark that indicated how high the flood should be if the fields were to get good soil.<br /> Between July and November, the reaches of the Nile running through Egypt would burst their banks and cover the adjacent flood plain. When the waters receded, around September or October, they left behind a rich alluvial deposit of exceptionally fertile black silt over the croplands. The akhet, or Season of the Inundation, was one of the three seasons into which the ancient Egyptians divided their year.<br /> The annual flood was of great importance to Egyptian civilization. A moderate inundation was a vital part of the agricultural cycle; however, a lighter inundation than normal would cause famine, and too much floodwater would be equally disastrous, washing away much of the infrastructure built on the flood plain. Records from AD 622–999 indicate that, on average, 28% of the years saw an inundation that fell short of expectations.<br /> The ability to predict the volume of the coming inundation was part of the mystique of the Ancient Egyptian priesthood. The same skill also played a political and administrative role, since the quality of the year&#8217;s flood was used to determine the levels of tax to be paid. This is where the nilometer came into play, with priests monitoring the day-to-day level of the river and announcing the awaited arrival of the summer flood.<br /> The simplest nilometer design is a vertical column submerged in the waters of the river, with marked intervals indicating the depth of the water. One that follows this simple design, albeit housed in an elaborate and ornate stone structure, can still be seen on the island of Rhoda in central Cairo (30.0069°N 31.2250°E). This nilometer visible today dates as far back as AD 861, when the Abbasid caliph al-Mutawakkil ordered its construction, overseen by the astronomer Alfraganus. It was built on a site occupied by an earlier specimen.<br /> The second nilometer design comprises a flight of stairs leading down into the water, with depth markings along the walls. The best-known example of this kind can be seen on the island of Elephantine in Aswan, where a stairway of 52 steps leads down to a doorway at the Nile. This location was also particularly important since for much of Egyptian history, Elephantine marked Egypt&#8217;s southern border and was, therefore, the first place where the onset of the annual flood was detected.<br /> The most elaborate design involved a channel or culvert that led from the riverbank – often running for a considerable distance – and then fed a well, tank, or cistern. These nilometer wells were most frequently located within the confines of temples, where only the priests and rulers were allowed access. A particularly fine example, with a deep, cylindrical well and a culvert opening in the surrounding wall, can be seen at the Temple of Kom Ombo, to the north of Aswan.<br /> While nilometers originated in Pharaonic times, they continued to be used by the later civilizations that held sway in Egypt. Some were constructed in Roman times.<br /> In the 20th century, the Nile&#8217;s annual inundation was first greatly reduced, and then eliminated entirely, with the construction of the Aswan dams. While the Aswan High Dam&#8217;s impact on Egypt and its agriculture has been controversial for other, more complex reasons, it has also had the additional effect of rendering the nilometer obsolete.<br /> The inside of the conical dome is a wonder of gilt Islamic decoration. The door was opened by a lady from the ticket desk. One can’t descent down the stairs. 40 with the Manasterly Palace.<br /> <strong>Manasterly Palace.</strong> Next door to the Nilometer and part of the same ticket, this has three large rooms with painted ceilings and walls.

The Umayyads stretched from western Spain all the way to western China. However, they were overthrown by the Abbasids, who moved the capital of the Umayyad empire itself to Baghdad. In Egypt, this shift in power involved moving control from the Umayyad city of Fustat slightly north to the Abbasid city of al-‘Askar.<br /> The peak of the Abbasid dynasty occurred during the reign of Harun al Rashid (r. 786-809), along with increased taxes on the Egyptians, who rose up in a peasant revolt in 832 during the time of Caliph al-Ma&#8217;mun (r. 813-833).<br /> <em>Al-Qatta&#8217;i, Tulunid capital.

Its name commemorates the date of &#8216;The Crossing&#8217;, which commenced the outbreak day of the Yom Kippur War in 1973.<br /> The bridge and causeway were completed in 1996, with construction taking nearly 30 years. The 6th October Bridge has been called the &#8216;spinal cord&#8217; of Cairo, with approximately half a million Cairene people using it on a daily basis.

In 1796 it was purchased by Sheikh Ahmed as-Suhaymi whose family held it for several subsequent generations. The Sheikh greatly extended the house from its original through incorporating neighbouring houses into its structure.<br /> The house is built around a sahn in the centre of which there is a small garden with plants and palm trees. From here several of the fine mashrabiya windows in the house can be seen. Much of the marble floor work, wooden furniture, and ceiling decor is still intact.<br /> There were 3 rooms to visit with very high ceilings with domes.

Only part of the palace remains today, however, the edifice was originally five stories tall, and featured running water on all floors. The most impressive surviving part of the palace is the large qa&#8217;a or reception hall. The hall features a coffered wooden ceiling, stucco windows of coloured glass, and a fountain of inlaid marble in the centre. The north and south sides of the hall also feature mashrabiyya (i.e. latticed wood screen) windows on the upper floors. 100<br /> Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan<br /> Egyptian Textile Museum<br /> <strong>Khan al Khalili market.</strong> Off Muizz Street, this large market has many jewelry, clothing, KK stores, inlaid boxes, and a few tea shops.

It was the seat of government in Egypt and the residence of its rulers for nearly 700 years from the 13th to the 19th centuries. Its location on a promontory of the Mokattam hills near the center of Cairo commands a strategic position overlooking the city and dominating its skyline. At the time of its construction, it was among the most impressive and ambitious military fortification projects of its time. It is now a preserved historic site, including mosques and museums.<br /> In the 20th century, it was used as a military garrison by the British occupation and then by the Egyptian army until being opened to the public in 1983. In 1976, it was proclaimed by UNESCO as a part of the World Heritage Site Historic Cairo (Islamic Cairo).<strong><br /> Muhammad Ali Mosque.</strong>  Situated on the summit of the citadel, this Ottoman mosque, the largest to be built in the first half of the 19th century, is, with its animated silhouette and twin minarets, the most visible mosque in Cairo.<br /> This mosque, along with the citadel, is one of the landmarks and tourist attractions of Cairo and is one of the first features to be seen when approaching the city from any direction. The mosque was built on the site of old Mamluk buildings in Cairo&#8217;s Citadel between 1830 and 1848,<br /> The mosque was built with a central dome surrounded by four small and four semicircular domes. It was constructed in a square plan and measured 41&#215;41 meters and gives a great feeling of space. The central dome is 21 meters in diameter and the height of the building is 52 meters. The central dome rises on four arches standing on colossal piers. There are four semicircular domes around the central dome. There are four smaller domes on the corners as well. The domes are painted and embellished with motifs in relief. The walls and pillars are covered with alabaster up to 11 meters high.<br /> Two elegant cylindrical minarets of Turkish type with two balconies and conical caps are situated on the western side of the mosque, and rise to 82 meters.<br /> The main material is limestone likely sourced from the Great Pyramids of Giza but the lower story and forecourt is tiled with alabaster up to 11,3 meters. The external facades are severe and angular and rise about four storeys until the level of the lead-covered domes.<br /> The mihrab on the southeastern wall is three storeys high and covered with a semicircular dome. There are two arcades on the second story,<br /> <strong>Egyptian National Military Museum.</strong> The official museum of the Egyptian Army located inside the Cairo Citadel. It overlooks the Mokattam Hills and the entrance to the Citadel. The Haram Palaces were originally constructed by Mohamed Ali Pasha in 1872.<br /> The exhibits include the Glory Hall, Artillery, Armaments, Pharaonic, Islamic Militartary exhibits and bits on the 1948 Arab–Israeli War Hall, 1956 Suez War, 1967 War Hall and the 1973 War. 50<br /> <strong>Al-Gawhara Palace</strong> The palace is situated south of the Mosque of Muhammad Ali in the Cairo Citadel and was commissioned in 1814. The palace was designed and constructed by artisans contracted from a variety of countries, including Greeks, Turks, Bulgarians, and Albanians as a two-story pavilion in the style of a Turkish <em>kushk</em>.<br /> In 1822, a fire destroyed the palace&#8217;s wooden construction in a blaze that lasted for 2 days. Later, Muhammad Ali had the structure expanded and elaborated. Two years later, in 1824, fire again damaged the palace after explosions of gunpowder. Muhammad Ali imported large slabs of marble from Italy to build a vestibule, staircase and corridors. Muhammad Ali&#8217;s official <em>divan</em> or audience hall, where the pasha received guests, contains a 1000kg chandelier sent to him by Louis-Philippe I of France. The palace also contains the throne of Muhammad Ali Pasha that was a gift from the King of Italy. 50</p><p><em>I left my phone in a tuk-tuk and walked back from the citadel to try to find it with no luck.

All were built during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of Ancient Egypt, between 2600 and 2500 BC. The site also includes several cemeteries and the remains of a worker&#8217;s village.<br /> The site is at the edges of the Western Desert, approximately 9 kilometres (5.6 mi) west of the Nile River in the city of Giza. Along with nearby Memphis, the site was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1979.<br /> The Great Pyramid and the Pyramid of Khafre are the largest pyramids built in ancient Egypt, and they have historically been common as emblems of Ancient Egypt in the Western imagination. They were popularised in Hellenistic times, when the Great Pyramid was listed by Antipater of Sidon as one of the Seven Wonders of the World. It is by far the oldest of the Ancient Wonders and the only one still in existence.<br /> The <b>Great Pyramid of Giza</b> (also known as the Pyramid of Khufu or the Pyramid of Cheops) is the oldest and largest of the pyramids in the Giza pyramid complex. It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely intact. It was built as a tomb for the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Khufu and estimate that it was built in the 26th century BC during a period of around 27 years.<br /> Initially standing at 146.5 metres (481 feet), the Great Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure in the world for more than 3,800 years. Throughout history the majority of the smooth white limestone casing was removed, which lowered the pyramid&#8217;s height to the present 138.5 metres (454.4 ft). What is seen today is the underlying core structure. The base was measured to be about 230.3 metres (755.6 ft) square, giving a volume of roughly 2.6 million cubic metres (92 million cubic feet), which includes an internal hillock.<br /> The dimensions of the pyramid were 280 royal cubits (146.7 m; 481.4 ft) high, a base length of 440 cubits (230.6 m; 756.4 ft), with a seked of <span class="sfrac" role="math">5 </span>1<span class="sfrac" role="math"><span class="tion"><span class="den">2</span></span></span> palms (a slope of 51°50&#8217;40&#8221;).<br /> The Great Pyramid was built by quarrying an estimated 2.3 million large blocks weighing 6 million tonnes total. The majority of stones are not uniform in size or shape and are only roughly dressed.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_5-0" class="reference"></sup> The outside layers were bound together by mortar. Primarily local limestone from the Giza Plateau was used. Other blocks were imported by boat down the Nile: White limestone from Tura for the casing, and granite blocks from Aswan, weighing up to 80 tonnes, for the King&#8217;s Chamber structure.<br /> There are three known chambers inside the Great Pyramid. The lowest was cut into the bedrock, upon which the pyramid was built, but remained unfinished.

Many varying scientific and alternative hypotheses attempt to explain the exact construction techniques.<br /> The funerary complex around the pyramid consisted of two mortuary temples connected by a causeway, tombs for the immediate family and court of Khufu, including three smaller pyramids for Khufu&#8217;s wives, an even smaller &#8220;satellite pyramid&#8221; and five buried solar barges.<br /> <strong>Khafre&#8217;s pyramid</strong> complex consists of a valley temple, the Sphinx temple, a causeway, a mortuary temple and the king&#8217;s pyramid. Khafre&#8217;s pyramid, completed in 2570 BC, appears larger than the adjacent Khufu Pyramid by virtue of its more elevated location, and the steeper angle of inclination of its construction—it is, in fact, smaller in both height and volume. Khafre&#8217;s pyramid retains a prominent display of casing stones at its apex.<br /> <strong>Menkaure&#8217;s pyramid complex</strong> consists of a valley temple, a causeway, a mortuary temple, and the king&#8217;s pyramid.

Saint Simon worked in tanning, a craft known there till this day. This profession involved other crafts that depend on the process, from whence Simon carried several titles related to skins: Tanner, Cobbler, Shoemaker.<br /> <em>The Miracle of Moving the Mountain.</em> According to a traditional story, Caliph al-Muizz, who reigned during AD 972–975, used to invite religious leaders to debate in his presence. In one of those meetings in which the patriarch Abraham, also known as Pope Abraam, and a Jew named Yaqub ibn Killis were present, Abraham got the upper hand in the debate. Plotting to take revenge, Ibn Killis quoted the verse where Jesus Christ said in the Gospel of Matthew: &#8220;He replied, &#8220;Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, &#8216;Move from here to there,&#8217; and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.&#8221;&#8221; (Matthew 17:20), and demanded that the Pope prove that his religion is right by means of this. After hearing ibn Killis say this, the caliph asked Abraham &#8220;What sayest thou concerning this word? Is it your gospel or not?&#8221; The patriarch answered &#8220;Yes, it is in it.&#8221; After hearing Abraham answer, the caliph demanded that this very miracle be performed by Abraham&#8217;s hand or else he and all the Copts would be killed by the sword. The patriarch asked for three days to complete the miracle.<br /> Abraham put together a group of monks, priests and elders. He told them stay in the church for three days for a penance. On the morning of the third day, Abraham was praying in the Hanging Church, when he saw Mary, mother of Jesus. The Holy Virgin told him to go to the great market. She said to him, &#8220;There thou wilt find a one-eyed man carrying on his shoulder a jar full of water; seize him, for he it is at whose hands this miracle shall be manifested.&#8221; Abraham listened to Mary and went to the market where he met the man the Holy Virgin spoke of. The man was Simon the tanner, who had plucked out his eye because of a passage from the Bible: &#8220;If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.&#8221; (Matthew 5:29–30).<br /> Simon told Abraham to go out with his priests and all his people to the mountain with the Caliph and all his soldiers. Simon then told Abraham to cry out &#8220;O Lord, have mercy&#8221; three times and each time to make the sign of the cross over the mountain. The patriarch followed the words of Simon and the mountain was lifted. After the miracle was performed in the presence of the Caliph, the Pope turned left and right looking for Simon, but he had disappeared and no one could find him. The Caliph turned to Abraham and said &#8220;O Patriarch, I have recognized the correctness of your faith.&#8221;<br /> Shortly after the miracle took place, Al-Muizz decided to convert to Christianity, abdicated in favour of his son and entered a monastery. A baptismal font, large enough for the immersion of a grown man, was built for him in the Church of Saint Mercurius. This font still exists today at the site where Al-Muizz has converted and is known as &#8220;Maamoudiat Al-Sultan&#8221;, &#8216;Baptistery of the Sultan&#8217;. This story is rejected by influential Muslim historians such as Ahmad Zaki Pasha and Muhammad Abdullah Enan.<br /> In commemoration of this miracle, the Coptic Orthodox Church observes three extra days of fasting before the beginning of the Nativity Fast. The Coptic website claims that the miracle occurred on November 27, 979 AD.<br /> <em>Discovery of St. Simon&#8217;s Relics.</em> <sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"></sup>During the years of 1989–91, Coptic clergymen and archaeologists searched for the relics of the 10th century tanner and saint, Simon. Simon was apparently buried in the cemetery of al-Habash in Old Cairo; however, while searching for Simon&#8217;s relics, his skeleton was discovered in the Coptic Orthodox Church of the Holy Virgin at Babylon El-Darag during its restoration. Simon&#8217;s skeleton was discovered on August 4, 1991, about one meter below the surface of the church. What was of particular interest when finding his skeleton was that the hair on his head was still intact and had not disintegrated. The hair that was intact was only on the back of his skull and it was deduced that the man was bald in front and had thick hair on the back of his head.<br /> In the church where Simon&#8217;s skeleton was found there was a painting that depicted the Coptic Pope Abraham and a bald-headed tanner carrying two water jars. The bald-headed man is most likely Simon because he was known for carrying water jars to the poor. The painting further depicted some of the characteristics of the discovered skeleton. In a church nearby a pot was discovered and was dated to be more than 1000 years old. It is believed that this clay pot was the vessel that Simon used to carry water to the poor. The jar is now kept in the new Church of Saint Simon on Muquattam, Cairo.<br /> Dedicated places of worship.<br /> <span id="Virgin_Mary_and_St._Simon_the_Tanner_Cathedral.2C_Cairo"></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span id="Virgin_Mary_and_St._Simon_the_Tanner_Cathedral,_Cairo" class="mw-headline">Virgin Mary and St. Simon the Tanner Cathedral, Cairo </span></span>in the Saint Samaan The Tanner Monastery is on the east bank of the Nile behind the Zabbaleen village.

Reaching the monastery is not an easy feat; it is difficult to get to, due to having to wind through the Zabbaleen village.<br /> Visit the Cathedral, the Church of St Bola, and the Church of St Marcus (the Cave church) completely in a cavern with openings on both ends and semi-circular seating around a small stage. The carvings on the cliffs and all the rocks may be the highlight.<br /> <strong>Mosque-Madrassa of Sulton Hassan.  </strong>There are two large mosques here, side by side, both huge with high walls.  <strong><br /> </strong>Mosque of Ali Rafau. Built over 40 years between 1869-1911 in the Mamluk style, it has tremendously high ceilings most with elaborate woodwork and 4 domes with elaborate gilt Maquina work. The lower walls are all inlaid marble, the mihrab ornate, and the minbar a marvel of inlaid wood and ivory. Visit the tombs of Mohammed Ali and his family, Presidents Farouk and Fouad, and the last Iranian Shah Muhammad Reza.<br /> Mosque of Sultan Haasan. Built in the 14th century at great expense, it has an open concept surrounding a non-functioning fountain, with the mihrab covered and the enormous mausoleum of Hassan in the back.  80 LE + 10 for each shoe guy.<br /> <strong>Gayer-Anderson Museum</strong> is an art museum situated adjacent to the Mosque of Ahmad ibn Tulun in the Sayyida Zeinab neighborhood. The building takes its name from Major R.G. Gayer-Anderson Pasha, who resided in the house between 1935 and 1942 with special permission from the Egyptian Government. The museum is noted for being one of the best-preserved examples of 17th-century domestic architecture left in Cairo, and also for its vast collection of furniture, carpets, curio, and other objects. 60 LE</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Day 24</span><br /> <em>I spent a good part of 3 hours on my Seychelles Health Travel authorization needing to both book a hotel and an onward flight to Mauritius. </em><br /> <em>I then took an Uber to the airport and caught my 7:20 pm flight to the Seychelles via Dubai arriving at 06:50. </em></p><p><em> </em></p></div></div></li></ul><p><strong> </strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="printfriendly pf-button pf-button-content pf-alignleft"> <a href="index.html#" rel="nofollow" onclick="window.print(); return false;" title="Printer Friendly, PDF & Email"> <noscript><img decoding="async" class="pf-button-img" src="https://cdn.printfriendly.com/buttons/printfriendly-pdf-email-button-md.png" alt="Print Friendly, PDF & Email" style="width: 194px;height: 30px;"  /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload pf-button-img" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://cdn.printfriendly.com/buttons/printfriendly-pdf-email-button-md.png" alt="Print Friendly, PDF & Email" style="width: 194px;height: 30px;"  /> </a></div></div></div><div id="entry-author-info"><div id="author-avatar"></div><div id="author-description"><h2> About admin</h2> I would like to think of myself as a full time traveler. I have been retired since 2006 and in that time have traveled every winter for four to seven months. The months that I am "home", are often also spent on the road, hiking or kayaking. 
I hope to present a website that describes my travel along with my hiking and sea kayaking experiences.<div id="author-link"> <a href="../../../../author/admin/index.html" rel="author"> View all posts by admin <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span> </a></div></div></div><div class="entry-utility"> This entry was posted in <a href="../../../../category/uncategorized/index.html" rel="category tag">Uncategorized</a>.
