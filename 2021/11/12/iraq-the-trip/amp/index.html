original trip to south Iraq was to be Nov 14-24, 2021, but that didn’t happen.</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><em>I flew from Sharm El Sheikh in the Egyptian Sinai to Cairo. At check-in for Qatar Airways in Cairo, I was not allowed to board. The check-in agent didn’t know that Iraq had a VOA and proceeded to read the entire IATA visa information and saw this: “Nationals of Canada can obtain a visa on arrival at Basra (BSR) for a maximum stay of 60 days. They must have a hotel reservation confirmation for 7 days at Minawi Pasha Hotel or Basra Touristic Hotel.” (You could substitute any country for Canada and the information was the same.). They were insistent and would not change. I tried to book the hotels listed but they were not on Booking.com and it turned out could not be booked online anywhere – creating an impossible situation.<br>Our guide (Haval) had mentioned that travellers were not being allowed to enter Basra without this 7-day hotel reservation but said that it was a scam perpetrated at the Basra Airport. He had clarified that the practice had been stopped and we only had a one-night reservation at a hotel different than the ones above. This would infer otherwise – it is on the official IATA website.<br>As it was now 3 am, I slept in the airport and caught an Uber back to the same hostel I had been in a week before.<br>I have since had many emails with Qatar Airlines about what happened. My main point was that if this policy was followed by every Qatar agent at check-in, then all flights by Qatar arriving at Basra would have no tourists on them. Nobody can satisfy the requirement. They only said that it was my responsibility to know the visa requirements and would not comment on this specific question.<br>As the flight was booked through an air travel company, any refund would have to be obtained from them, not Qatar Airlines. I will never fly with Qatar Airlines again. Their intransigence was unbelievable. </em></span></p> <p><span class="acss38e22"><strong>IRAQ Sept 16-24, 2022<br>Visa. </strong>VOA (application (use their forms at the airport). The two photos and paper copies of flights and hotel information were not needed. <strong><br>Cost.</strong> Independent travel. Rent car US$38/day Hertz Babylon Baghdad. Iraq is very cheap (all prices in US$). Hotels (single) – $35-50/night. Food – groceries and restaurant food is one third of the prices in Canada. Gas 450 ID/litre (about .30 cents. I fill the tank in the rental car for $10. </span><br><span class="acss38e22">The only expensive thing are World Heritage Sites at 25,000 ID (US$17). </span><br><span class="acss38e22"><strong>Currency.</strong> Iraqi Dinar IQD. 1US$=1,459; 1€=1,503; 1CAD=1,142 xe.com Aug 2022</span><br><span class="acss38e22">US dollars are the currency of travel. Bring cash for the entire trip in new (2017 or newer), 100 or 50 denominations, no creases or marks (iron them). You cannot spend US$ here but must convert them. Make sure to convert some money in the airport on arrival as it is needed to take a taxi downtown. I have been paying my hotels in US$100 bills and getting change in dinars. They don’t care about the quality of the money (maybe it is money changers who demand this?)</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><strong>Electrical plug:</strong> three plug types, types C (European), D (3 round pins) and G (British- three rectangular pins). Most hotel rooms have type C and G (the most useful).</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><strong>Weather.</strong> In mid-September, it was at least 35 every day. I find the heat hard to tolerate. This would be an impossible country to live in withoout A/C. The best times to come are Oct to March.</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><strong>Driving.</strong> Google Maps loses all its navigational ability in Iraq (like Kosovo and south Turkey) – only Preview is available – the map has be moved along and refreshed regularly no turns, no scale changes, no rerouting. Make sure to turn off Mobile Data as GM uses a lot of data even though it provides only a route. Maps Me provides good navigation but has many fewer sites so I varied between the two to get anywhere.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">Iraqi drivers are not disciplined. They go through red lights and don’t obey any right-of-way rules. It is very much like driving in India where right-of-way is determined by who got there first. The speed limits are 100 highway and 60 city but I have been driving at 120-160 and often not keeping up to the fast drivers who come up behind, flash lights and tailgate – they are very aggressive drivers. They rarely signal and follow none of the lane-speed rules we obey in Canada.. At night some vehicles don’t have lights. It is not uncommon to have vehicles going the wrong way on one-way roads.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">I see very few women driving in Iraq, many less than in Saudi Arabia. </span><br><span class="acss38e22"><strong>Phone.</strong> It was easy and efficient to buy a SIM card in Iraq. For $11 I purchased 5 gigs for 10 days. It was activated and worked in the store. </span><br><span class="acss38e22"><strong>Mosques.</strong> From the outside, they may be the prettiest collectively in the world. Most have “onion” domes covered in coloured tiles. The minarets and exterior are often brick and tile in ornamental designs. But inside, they must be the least attractive – very plain with a simple or usually no mihrab, a very small minbar and calligraphy banners on the walls. </span><br><span class="acss38e22">Unlike any other mosque I have seen, the prayer hall is equally divided between men and women with a short wood wall. </span><br><span class="acss38e22"><strong>Business hours.</strong> Closed Friday, Saturday and most of Sunday until 5 pm. Stores stay open until 11 pm usually. Evening is the best time to do chores.</span></p> <p><span class="acss38e22"><strong>ITINERARY</strong></span><br><span class="acss38e22"><strong><span class="acss93460">Days 1</span> </strong>Fri Sept 16.</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><em>Flight </em><em>Tunis – Istanbul – Baghdad</em>  (Turkish Air/VDP6PO $673) TUN-IST @17:05-21:55 (TK664) / IST-BGW @02:05-0500+1 (TK802)</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><em>VOA.</em> There is a small desk near the immigration booths that you hand in your visa application form (use the form they give you), passport and US$77. They had no interest in the photos or printed flights and hotel reservation. It took about 30 minutes to get the visa.</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><em>Money.</em> Exchange money at the airport. Dinars are used for transactions not US$. You need money to pay for the taxis to get into the center.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">There is good wifi at the airport to message someone.</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><em>Transportation from airport:</em> The taxi drivers said there was no bus but one did st0p at 6am near Gate D. There were none after. Taxi – $30-40 to hotel (best in front of Gate C)</span><br><span class="acss38e22">Cheapest transport: assuming there is no bus, from arrivals, cross the street and enter the parking garage from Gate D and get a share taxi 9.5 km to Abbas Square (“the taxi stand” 10,000 ID). I was told there were also share taxis from here into the Green Zone but I saw none as all were returning to the airport. I caught a regular taxi (quoted 20,000 ID but only charged 15,000, a very unusual driver) the 32 km directly to my hotel. You must keep your flight boarding pass to be able to get a cab.</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><em>Hotel.</em> Life Palace Hotel and Restaurant.</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><strong><br>Karbala Festival.</strong> A Shia Moslem festival, it is supposedly the largest festival in the world, and was occurring on Friday and Saturday. Apparently 21 million attended this year. Some walk the 58 km from Najaf but most arrive by car. They have no wants when in Karbala – all food and lodging is provided free and no one does without. There were several Americans and Brits going to the festival were on my flight.</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><span class="acss8af2a"><strong>The Hajj Pilgrimage Routes: the Dark Zubaydah</strong> (Iraq). </span>Early Muslim historians detail the major roads linking Makkah with Yemen, Oman, Syria, Egypt, and Iraq. They initially followed former pre-Islamic trade routes but progressively evolved for Islamic pilgrimage. </span><br><span class="acss38e22">The road that connected Makkah to the Iraqi cities of Kufa and Baghdad during the Abbasid period is known as the <em>Darb Zubaydah</em> (Zubaydah’s trail) after Zubaydah bint Jafar, wife of the Abbasid Caliph Harun Al-Rashid, who supported charitable works on the numerous stations along the trail. It was the most important <em>hajj </em>route during the Abbasid Caliphate, between 750 to 850 CE, a period renowned as a golden age of Muslim civilization. At its peak of prosperity, markers and milestones were installed along the route that was provided with wells, pools, dams, palaces, houses, and partially paved to facilitate the passage of pilgrims. 27 major stations and 27 substations have been identified.<strong><br></strong><strong><br>BAGHDAD </strong>(pop estimated at 6 to over 7 million) is the capital of Iraq and the second-largest city in the Arab world after Cairo. It is located on the Tigris near the ruins of the ancient Akkadian city of Babylon and the Sassanid Persian capital of Ctesiphon. In 762 CE, Baghdad was chosen as the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate and became its most notable major development project. Within a short time, the city evolved into a significant cultural, commercial, and intellectual center of the Muslim world. This, in addition to housing several key academic institutions, including the House of Wisdom, as well as a multi-ethnic and multi-religious environment, garnered it a worldwide reputation as the “Center of Learning”.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">Baghdad was the largest city in the world for much of the Abbasid era during the Islamic Golden Age, peaking at a population of more than a million. <sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"></sup>The city was largely destroyed at the hands of the Mongol Empire in 1258, resulting in a decline that would linger through many centuries due to frequent plagues and multiple successive empires. With the recognition of Iraq as an independent state (formerly the British Mandate of Mesopotamia) in 1932, Baghdad gradually regained some of its former prominence as a significant center of Arab culture. Compared to its large population, it has a small area of just 673 square kilometres (260 sq mi).</span><br><span class="acss38e22">The city has faced severe infrastructural damage due to the Iraq War, which began with the United States-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and lasted until 2011, and the subsequent insurgency and renewed war that lasted until 2017, resulting in a substantial loss of cultural heritage and historical artifacts. During this period, Baghdad had one of the highest rates of terrorist attacks in the world. However, terrorist attacks are rare and have been declining since the territorial defeat of the Islamic State militant group in Iraq in 2017.</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><strong>Hotel. </strong>Life Palace Hotel and Restaurant. Allowed to check in at 8 am, paid with US$100 and given change in dinars at a good rate.</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><em>I arrived on a Friday so everything was closed. I had gotten zero sleep on any of my flights or layovers so I slept all day. </em></span><br><span class="acss38e22"><em>Before the trip, I had posted on EPS (Every Passport Stamp) and had found a travel mate for the entire 10 days (Mehul from New Jersey). He arrived early on the 17th.</em><strong><br></strong></span></p> <p><span class="acss38e22"><span class="acss93460"><strong>Day 2</strong></span> Saturday Sept 17.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">Mehul arrived at 6 am, had a shower, we had a coffee and left at 08:30. We had decided (wisely it turned out) to get the rental car in the morning and took a taxi to Babylon Rotana Hertz office. We waited for the office to open at 9 and got the car.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">Driving around Baghdad was torture if uninformed. The Green Zone is a heavily fortified area requiring a “badge” to enter. The 14th of July Bridge, which accesses the Green Zone was closed making for a longer drive. Other exits likewise were closed. It was also a Saturday and most businesses were closed. So we decided to rent the car and start driving the 500 km to Basra.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">It ended up taking us approximately 11 hours with all the police checks. I believe they profiled people as most vehicles weren’t stopped, but we always were. The “captain” always was called. Few were short but with proper preparation, it can be much easier – have your passports and driver registration ready to hand to the policeman. Prepare a Google Translate message. This worked very well for me as they are totally unfamiliar with foreigners renting vehicles and driving around without a driver. Translate into Arabic and print it or have it ready on your computer or phone. <strong> <br><br>LETTER TO IRAQ CHECKPOINTS <br></strong><em>“I am a retired Canadian medical doctor visiting Iraq as a tourist for 9 days to see your great country.

It was founded during the Sasanian rule, and was used as a synonym for Ctesiphon by the Arabs, and later by the Muslims.</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKröger1993446–448_2-0" class="reference"></sup>According to folklore, al-Mada’in was constructed by the legendary Iranian kings Tahmuras or Hushang, who named it Kardbandad. The city was then later rebuilt by the legendary Iranian king Zab, the Macedonian king Alexander the Great (r. 356–323 BCE) and the Sasanian king Shapur II (r. 309–379 CE).</span><br><span class="acss38e22">Ctesiphon, the capital of the Sasanian Empire.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">During the Sasanian period, the population of al-Mada’in was heavily mixed, it included Arameans, Persians, Greeks, and Assyrians. Several religions were also practiced in the metropolis, which included Christianity, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism. Much of the population fled from al-Mada’in after the Arab capture of the metropolis. <br><br><amp-img data-hero id="PreviewImage" class=" amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://media02.stockfood.com/largepreviews/MjIxMDUxNjk2OQ==/71306999-The-ancient-city-of-Ctesiphon-with-largest-brick-arch-in-the-world-Ctesiphon-Iraq-Middle-East.jpg" alt="The ancient city of Ctesiphon with largest brick arch in the world, Ctesiphon, Iraq, Middle East" width="617" height="411" layout="intrinsic"><amp-img fallback data-hero id="PreviewImage" class=" amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://www.ronperrier.net/wp-content/plugins/accelerated-mobile-pages/images/SD-default-image.png" alt="The ancient city of Ctesiphon with largest brick arch in the world, Ctesiphon, Iraq, Middle East" width="617" height="411" layout="intrinsic"></amp-img></amp-img><span class="acsseac9f"><br></span><br>Al-Mada’in has received considerable interest from archaeologists since the 18th century</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><strong>Taq-i Kisra</strong> is now all that remains above ground of a city that was, for seven centuries—from the 2nd century BC to the 7th century AD—the main capital of the successor dynasties of the Persian empire: Parthians and Sassanids. It is sometimes called the <b>Arch of Ctesiphon</b>. The structure left today was the main portico of the audience hall of the Sassanids and is the only visible remaining structure of the ancient city of Ctesiphon. The archway is considered a landmark in the history of architecture and is the largest single-span vault of unreinforced brickwork in the world.</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"></sup>The exact time of construction is not known – either between 242 to 272 AD<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"></sup> or after a campaign against the Byzantines in 540 AD.</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"></sup>The arch was part of the imperial palace complex.

The top of the arch is about 1 meter thick while the walls at the base area are up to 7 meters thick. The catenary arch was built without centring. To make this possible several techniques were used.<sup id="cite_ref-Julian185_6-3" class="reference"></sup> The bricks were laid about 18 degrees from the vertical which allowed them to be partially supported by the rear wall during construction.<sup id="cite_ref-Julian185_6-4" class="reference"></sup> The quick-drying cement used as mortar allowed the fresh bricks to be quickly supported by those that were previously laid.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">The restoration was completed in 2017. <sup id="cite_ref-auto_15-0" class="reference"></sup>On March 7, 2019, a partial collapse further damaged the Taq Kasra,</span><br><span class="acss38e22">When we were there, the area was gated as the U of Pennsylvania was restoring the last collapse.

Ever since the 10th century, Babylonian Jews have visited the tomb and only in the 12th century did Muslims begin to associate the site with a Quranic prophet – Dhul-Kifl, often identified as Ezekiel. In 1180, Jews held the keys to the site and 60,000 and 80,000 Jews converged on the tomb during the week of Sukkot. <strong><br></strong>In 1860, the tomb became a source of contention when Muslims attempted to wrest control of the site. Upon the intervention of the Anglo-Jewish Association, a government emissary from Constantinople decided in favour of the Jews. Until the mid-20th century, over 5,000 Jews used to come to the tomb from Baghdad during Passover. The tomb walls contained various inscriptions including three poems. An adjoining room contained five tombs of Geonim. Another room is “Elijah’s Cave,” and a third room has tombs of the Daniel family of Baghdad who were custodians of the site. A Hebrew plaque above the doorway dating from 1810 read “This is the tomb of our master Yehezkel the Prophet, son of Buzi the Kohen, may his merit shield us and all Israel. Amen.”<strong><br></strong>After the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, the tomb complex and old synagogue courtyard were converted into a Muslim prayer area.

Babylon was the ancient city where some of the most influential empires of the ancient world ruled. It was the capital of the Babylonian Empire and it was considered to be a center of commerce, art, and learning. It is estimated to have been the largest early city in the world, perhaps the first to reach a population above 200,000.</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><sup id="cite_ref-Chandler_2-0" class="reference"></sup>Presently it is an archeological site 1054.3 hectares in size with several thousand residents and a few villages 85 km south of Baghdad.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"> </sup>The ancient city is built along both banks of the Euphrates river, had steep embankments to contain the river’s seasonal floods. Originally, the river roughly bisected the city, but the course of the river has since shifted so that most of the remains of the former western part of the city are now inundated. Only about 10% of the ancient city has been excavated.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">Kasr Palace or Castle has the ziggurat Etemenanki and lies in the center of the site.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">Babylon was pillaged numerous times by the Hittites and Elamites in the 2nd millennium and the Neo-Assyrian Empire and the Achaemenid Empire in the 1st millennium. Much of the western half of the city is now beneath the river, and other parts of the site have been mined for commercial building materials.</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><strong>History.</strong> The earliest mention is as a small town on a clay tablet from 2334–2279 BC in the Akkadian Empire when it was a minor city-state. Hammurabi (r. 1792–1750 BC) conquered all of the cities and city-states of southern Mesopotamia coalescing them into one kingdom and then extended it to Assyria’s Hattian and Hurrian colonies in Asia Minor. This part of the city is 10 m below and will never be excavated as it is below the water table. </span><br><span class="acss38e22">After the reign of Hammurabi, the whole of southern Mesopotamia came to be known as Babylonia and Babylon supplanted Nippur and Eridu as the major religious centers of southern Mesopotamia. Hammurabi’s empire was destabilized after his death by Assyrians. The Amorite dynasty remained in power in Babylon, which again became a small city-state.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">In 1595 BC, t<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"></sup>he city was overthrown by the Hittite Empire from Asia Minor and then by Kassites from the Zagros Mountains of northwestern Ancient Iran creating a dynasty that lasted for 435 years, until 1160 BC. Part of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911–609 BC), Babylonia was in a constant state of revolt suppressed only by the complete destruction of the city of Babylon. In 689 BC, its walls, temples, and palaces were razed, and the rubble was thrown into the Arakhtu sea.</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><span id="Neo-Babylonian_Empire" class="mw-headline"><em>Neo-Babylonian Empire.</em> In </span>612 BC Babylon became the capital of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. A<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"></sup> new era of architectural activity ensued, particularly during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II (604–561 BC) who completely reconstructed the imperial grounds, the Etemenanki ziggurat, and the Ishtar Gate—the most prominent of eight gates around Babylon. A reconstruction of the Ishtar Gate is located in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">Nebuchadnezzar is also credited with the construction of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Whether the gardens existed is a matter of dispute. <sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"></sup>Nebuchadnezzar is also notoriously associated with the Babylonian exile of the Jews. This is the era exposed in modern excavations. </span><br><span class="acss38e22"><em>Persian.</em> In 539 BC, the Neo-Babylonian Empire fell to Cyrus the Great, king of Persia, According to 2 Chronicles 36 of the Hebrew Bible, Cyrus later issued a decree permitting captive people, including the Jews, to return to their own lands as described on the Cyrus Cylinder. Under Cyrus and the subsequent Persian king Darius I, Babylon became the capital city of the 9th Satrapy as well as a center of learning and scientific advancement. In Achaemenid Persia, the ancient Babylonian arts of astronomy and mathematics were revitalized, and Babylonian scholars completed maps of constellations. The city became the administrative capital of the Persian Empire and remained prominent for over two centuries. The early Persian kings had attempted to maintain the religious ceremonies of Marduk, who was the most important god, but by the reign of Darius III, over-taxation and the strain of numerous wars led to a deterioration of Babylon’s main shrines and canals and the destabilization of the surrounding region. There were numerous attempts at rebellion and in 522 BC (Nebuchadnezzar III), 521 BC (Nebuchadnezzar IV) and 482 BC (Bel-shimani and Shamash-eriba) native Babylonian kings briefly regained independence. However, these revolts were quickly repressed and Babylon remained under Persian rule for two centuries, until Alexander the Great’s entry in 331 BC.</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><span id="Hellenistic_period" class="mw-headline"><em>Hellenistic period</em>. </span>In October of 331 BC, Darius III, the last Achaemenid king of the Persian Empire, was defeated by the forces of the Ancient Macedonian ruler Alexander at the Battle of Gaugamela. Under Alexander, Babylon again flourished as a center of learning and commerce. However, following Alexander’s death in 323 BC in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar, his empire was divided amongst his generals, the Diadochi, and decades of fighting soon began. The constant turmoil virtually emptied the city of Babylon. Babylon became insignificant as a city.<br></span><br><span class="acss38e22"><amp-img data-hero class="acsseac9f amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/The_historical_city_of_Babylon.jpg/840px-The_historical_city_of_Babylon.jpg" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/The_historical_city_of_Babylon.jpg/1260px-The_historical_city_of_Babylon.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/The_historical_city_of_Babylon.jpg/1680px-The_historical_city_of_Babylon.jpg 2x" alt="Panoramic view of ruins in Babylon photographed in 2005" width="621" height="133" layout="intrinsic"><amp-img fallback data-hero class="acsseac9f amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://www.ronperrier.net/wp-content/plugins/accelerated-mobile-pages/images/SD-default-image.png" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/The_historical_city_of_Babylon.jpg/1260px-The_historical_city_of_Babylon.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/The_historical_city_of_Babylon.jpg/1680px-The_historical_city_of_Babylon.jpg 2x" alt="Panoramic view of ruins in Babylon photographed in 2005" width="621" height="133" layout="intrinsic"></amp-img></amp-img><span class="acsseac9f">Panoramic view of ruins in Babylon photographed in 2005<br></span><strong><br>Saddam’s Castle. </strong>In the 1980s, during the Iran-Iraq War, Saddam Hussein became obsessed with the Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar, who is notorious for waging bloody wars to seize large swaths of current-day Iran and Israel. Saddam saw himself as a modern reincarnation of Nebuchadnezzar, and to prove it, he spent millions building a massive reconstruction of Babylon.</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><span class="section-start-text"><strong>The Ruins of Babylon</strong> </span>known as Babel, date back over 3,000 years. The world’s first-known civil code was written here; Alexander the Great died here; countless Bible stories take place here. It holds an imagined as well as real presence in many people’s minds, which may be why so many rulers have tried to build their dreams here.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the area around Babylon came under the control of US troops who built the military base “Camp Alpha”, with a helipad and other facilities on ancient Babylonian ruins during the Iraq War. US forces caused irreparable damage to the archaeological record. They caused substantial damage to the Ishtar Gate, one of the most famous monuments from antiquity. US military vehicles crushed 2,600-year-old brick pavements, archaeological fragments were scattered across the site, more than 12 trenches were driven into ancient deposits and military earth-moving projects contaminated the site for future generations of scientists.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">The entrance to Babylon is a gate made from bright blue bricks and a gold overlay, looks like it could have been transplanted from Vegas, or Disneyland*. Babylon was transformed from an archeological site to the jewel of Saddam’s vanity projects—and then to an occupied territory under the Americans. Today, it seems to fall between a picnic site and an abandoned theme park.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">The museum is well worth seeing. The highlight is the “panel” of the Upper Ishtar Gate, one of only two in Iraq. 24 are at the Pergamon Museum in Berlin, 12 are in Istanbul and 2 are in Chicago. </span><br><span class="acss38e22">Saddam invaded Iran in 1980, but by 1983, the pan-Arabist dream was drawing thin. The war showed no sign of ending, and Iraqis did not understand why they were fighting in a conflict they never asked for. To fuel support for the battle, Saddam turned increasingly to grand nationalist building projects. That was when he ordered the reconstruction of Babylon.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">Saddam siphoned millions into the rebuilding and pushed to have the reconstruction built on the foundations of the original site. The project was not only nationalistic but also narcissistic and megalomaniacal. Saddam wanted every Iraqi to know that he rebuilt Babylon. The point is that it’s not just an archaeological reconstruction of the city of Babylon for the sake of science and history and the past. It’s an idealization of that history for the cementing of the legitimacy of the regime’s presence.”</span><br><span class="acss38e22">When Saddam heard that Nebuchadnezzar had stamped the bricks of ancient Babylon with his name and titles, he ordered that the reconstruction mimic this practice. To this day, in the maze behind the Southern Palace, scores of bricks are stamped with a declaration: “In the reign of the victorious Saddam Hussein, the president of the Republic, may God keep him the guardian of the great Iraq and the renovator of its renaissance and the builder of its great civilization, the rebuilding of the great city of Babylon was done in 1987.”</span><br><span class="acss38e22">The war killed hundreds of thousands of soldiers. When it ended in 1988, under a ceasefire brokered by the United Nations, Saddam had changed Babylon.</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><strong>Saddam’s Palace.</strong> Saddam wanted a palace to overlook his works, and Qawaris, a small village on the edge of the Tigris River was in the perfect location. In 1986, he built an artificial hill in its place. His palace at Babylon is carved with Arabic calligraphy that are Saddam Hussein’s initials. Brutalist, hyper-realist reliefs depict him leading soldiers on the battlefield; the ceilings are painted with symbols of Iraqi civilization, ranging from Babylonian lions to towers that Saddam built in Baghdad.</span></p> <figure class="article-image-full-width contains-caption "><amp-img data-hero id="article-image-70572" class="article-image with-structured-caption lazyloaded amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://img.atlasobscura.com/f-b12VYYt5By9myUGE_DPojcFf2_70CmMCL5BvDQFu0/rt:fill/w:1200/el:1/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL2Fzc2V0/cy8xYWM3NDA2OS1j/NmM4LTQ5NzAtYjM3/My1mZWQyYmFiY2Qw/Nzg1ZjZjMmQxNGMx/ZTJjNmI0NDdfR2V0/dHlJbWFnZXMtODM4/OTQ5ODcuanBn.jpg" alt="To fuel support for his war with Iran, Saddam turned increasingly turned to grand nationalist building projects like Babylon.

The horsemen denied Husayn and his followers water to force Husayn to give an oath of allegiance. On the 9th of Muharram, Husayn refused and on 10 Muharram, he did his morning prayer and led his troops into battle. Many of Husayn’s followers, including all of his present sons Ali Akbar, and Ali Asghar (six months old), and his nephews Qassim, Aun, and Muhammad were killed.

Ukhaidir represents Abbasid architectural innovation in the structures of its courtyards, residences, and mosque. Ukhaidir was an important stop on regional trade routes, similar to Atshan and Mujdah. The complex comprises a primary hall, a large Iwan, a reception hall, and servants’ quarters. The fortress exemplifies Abbasid architecture in Iraq by demonstrating the “despotic and the pleasure-loving character of the dynasty” in its grand size but cramped living quarters.<strong><br></strong>The current name comes from  Isma’il ibn Yusuf al-Ukhaidhir who launched a rebellion against the Abbasid, then later he became the governor of Kufa.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">Out in the middle of nowhere, this was interesting but not worth the price to go inside. 25,000 ID</span></p> <p><span class="acss38e22"><amp-img data-hero class="low-res-photo acsseac9f amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/8536/8768465707_8f284fa33b_n.jpg" alt="Al-Ukhaidir fortress | by Mashkour" width="620" height="258" layout="intrinsic"><amp-img fallback data-hero class="low-res-photo acsseac9f amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://www.ronperrier.net/wp-content/plugins/accelerated-mobile-pages/images/SD-default-image.png" alt="Al-Ukhaidir fortress | by Mashkour" width="620" height="258" layout="intrinsic"></amp-img></amp-img></span></p> <p><span class="acss38e22"><strong>Al-Tar caves.</strong> Located 45 Km from Karbala between Babylon to the east and Al-Anbar to the west, they date from 1200-1300 BC, probably by people from Sumer.

The engagement decided the fate of Ottoman Iraq and kept it under Istanbul’s suzerainty until the First World War.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">During the 20th century, Samarra gained new importance when a permanent lake, Lake Tharthar, was created through the construction of the Samarra Barrage, which was built to prevent the frequent flooding of Baghdad. Many local people were displaced by the dam, increasing Samarra’s population.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">Though Samarra is famous for its Shi’i holy sites, including the tombs of several Shi’i Imams, the town was traditionally until very recently, dominated by Sunni Arabs. Tensions arose between Sunnis and the Shi’a during the Iraq War. Ever since the end of the Iraqi civil war in 2007, the Shia population of the holy city has increased exponentially. However, violence has continued, with bombings taking place in 2011 and 2013.

The remains of the city lie on the western bank of the Tigris River, north of the confluence with its tributary, the Little Zab.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">Occupation of the city itself continued for approximately 4,000 years, from the Early Dynastic Period to the mid-14th century AD when the forces of Timur massacred its predominately Christian population. The site is a World Heritage Site, added in 2003 following the conflict that erupted following the US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq and as a result of a proposed dam which would flood some of the site. Assur lies 65 kilometres (40 mi) south of the site of Nimrud and 100 km (60 mi) south of Nineveh.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">The inner city was protected by encircling <span id="ref704561"></span>walls nearly 2.5 miles (4 km) long. On the eastern side Ashur was washed by the Tigris, along which massive quays were first erected by Adad-nirari I (reigned <em>c.</em> 1295–<em>c.</em> 1264). On the north side, an arm of the river and a high escarpment afforded natural defences, which were augmented by a system of buttressed walls and by a powerful sally port called the <em>mushlalu</em>—a semicircular tower of rusticated stone masonry, built by Sennacherib and probably the earliest known example of this type of architecture. The southern and western sides were protected by a strong fortification system.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">A catalog of Ashur’s buildings inscribed during the reign of <span id="ref169048"></span>Sennacherib (704–681) lists 34 temples, although fewer than one-third of them have been found.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">In addition to the temples, three palaces were identified. The oldest of these was ascribed to <span id="ref169049"></span>Shamshi-Adad I (<em>c.</em> 1813–<em>c.</em> 1781) and was later used as a burial ground. Many of the private houses found in the northwestern quarter of the site were spaciously laid out and had family vaults beneath their floors, where dozens of archives and libraries were uncovered in the course of the German excavations. The irregular planning of the town indicates a strict respect for <span id="ref704565"></span>property rights and land tenure.

They were lowered with a complex system of pulleys and levers operated by dozens of men. The cart was towed by 300 men. He initially tried to hook up the cart to a team of buffalo and have them haul it. However, the buffalo refused to move. Then they were loaded onto a barge which required 600 goatskins and sheepskins to keep it afloat.

It lies at the north end of the Persian Gulf and has a small (58km) coastline in the southeast of the country. It is surrounded by Iran to the east, Kuwait to the south, Saudi Arabia to the southwest, Jordan to the west, Syria to the northwest, and Turkey to the north. Iraq was the center of Mesopotamia, the cradle of civilization. The Shia holy cities of Najaf and Karbala are located in Iraq.</span></p> <p><span class="acss38e22"><strong>HISTORY<br></strong>Iraq is the birthplace of many of the Earth’s oldest civilizations, including the Babylonians and the Assyrians. A part of the Greek Macedonian empire from 300 BC, the Treaty of Sèvres brought the area under British control in 1918. Iraq gained independence in 1932. On 14 July 1958, the long-time Hashemite monarchy was overthrown in a coup led by Abd al-Karim Qasim that paved the way to radical political reforms, including the legalization of political parties such as the Ba’ath and the Communist Party, both key players in the coup (also called the 14 July Revolution). Following this Revolution, the Soviet Union gradually became its main arms and commercial supplier.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">In February 1963, Qasim was overthrown and killed in a second coup that brought the Ba’ath Party into power. Internal divisions would follow for the next five years, until another coup on 17 July 1968 led by Ahmad Hassan al-Bakr (with Communist support) stabilized the party. Relations between the Communists and the Ba’athists ranged from mutual cooperation to violent mistrust, culminating in the purge of Communists from the army and the government by 1978, causing a temporary rift with the Soviet Union. On 16 July 1979, Bakr resigned and was succeeded by the right-hand man Saddam Hussein, who carefully killed his enemies and became a dictator almost overnight.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">The next twenty-five years took a grinding toll on the country. A long war with neighboring Iran in the 1980s cost hundreds of thousands of lives and billions of dollars. The invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and the subsequent Gulf War caused further casualties, followed by civil war inside the country and a decade of international sanctions.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">The northern part of the country is inhabited by the Kurdish people and is called Kurdistan.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">Iraq was invaded in 2003 by a mainly US-led coalition of forces, who removed Saddam Hussein from power. The northern part gained autonomy in 2005 and now its called Kurdistan where the majority Kurdish people live.</span></p> <p><span class="acss38e22"><strong>Climate. </strong>Most of Iraq has a hot arid climate. Summer temperatures average above 48°C (120°F) for most of the country and frequently exceed 49°C (121°F). Winter temperatures infrequently exceed 22°C (73°F) with maximums roughly 16 to 17°C (61 to 62°F) and night-time lows occasionally below freezing. Typically precipitation is low, most places receive less than 250mm (10 in) annually with maximum rainfall during the months of November to April. Rainfall during the summer is extremely rare except in the very north of Iraq.<strong> </strong></span></p> <p><span class="acss38e22"><strong>Get in. </strong>Visitors from the following countries/Areas; the EU, Andorra, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Iceland, Iran, Japan, Kuwait, Liechtenstein, Monaco, New Zealand, Norway, Qatar, San Marino, South Korea, Switzerland, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United States, and Vatican City will get an entry stamp for max 15 days at Erbil or Sulaimaniyah International Airport.</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><em>By plane. </em>Baghdad International Airport (IATA: BGW) is about 16km from the centre of Baghdad.</span></p> <p><span class="acss38e22"><strong>Get around<br></strong>In Kurdistan, public transport is rare although regular buses do link Zakho and Dohuk and cost about 2 USD. From Dohuk, shared taxis leave all day for Erbil and other cities. The road from Dohuk to Arbil goes south near Mosul, but does not leave Kurdish territory and is thus safe, although perhaps too close for comfort.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">Shared Taxis might be the safest way to travel in Iraqi Kurdistan, as the drivers are not interested in leaving the province either.</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><em>By car. </em>Driving at night may be a safer alternative to daytime driving, but a few rules to follow. Avoid city centres. Although most Iraqis are asleep by midnight, the few that are awake are almost certainly up to no good.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">Watch for the military. If you are out late at night and effectively trying to blend in with the locals, you could be mistaken for a hostile/troublemaker. At checkpoints, you will also be treated as a suspect, and until they decide you are not a target, you must conduct yourself carefully. If you do encounter the military, ensure your lights are on (at night), slow or pull over to the side of the road and follow any and all instructions given. If you approach a checkpoint, turn your lights off. It’s a good idea to have an Arabic speaking guide with you in order to navigate through the tricky checkpoints in Southern Iraq.</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><strong>Talk. </strong>Arabic is the official language of Iraq. However, the majority of Iraqi Arabs speak one of the two national varieties of Iraqi Arabic (Northern and Southern). The Northern variety known as Qeltu Iraqi is spoken in areas such as Mosul, Dohuk, and Kirkuk while the Southern variety known as Gilit Iraqi is spoken in Baghdad, Karbala, and Amarah. The varieties are named after the term for “I said” in each respective dialect.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">English is not commonly spoken and most travellers will not able to get by in the various shops, markets and cafes. The further downside is that speaking English will immediately identify you as an outsider. This is dangerous because of the strong underground network of Iraqis who inform attackers of possible target opportunities.</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><strong>Buy </strong>10,000 Iraqi dinar (IQD) = 5.87 Euro (Oct 20,2021)</span><br><span class="acss38e22">Iraqi dinar is the official currency, however you will also be able to spend Euros € and US Dollars $ almost everywhere. Be aware that most people do not like to make change for large bills. Also note that any defects in the bills (creases, ink stamps from banks, tears, etc.) will raise suspicion that you are a counterfeiter. Don’t bring old bills with you, either. Carry mostly small bills in the form of Iraqi dinars for daily spending cash. Since the introduction of the new Iraqi dinar, its widespread acceptance and confidence has reduced the prominence of the USD, and many shopkeepers are now refusing to accept them. However, most people will still pay large hotel bills or rent payments using USD or EUR due to the sheer volume of notes required to pay with dinars. The conversion rate fluctuates from day to day and from town to town, but is around 1175 dinar to US$1. Inflation used to be relative high (65% a year since 2003) but in recent years it is much lower than before (11% in 2008), which makes the Iraqi dinar becomes an attractive target for investors, unlike the Vietnamese dong.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">Learn the security features of the new dinar and dollar notes; the former Iraqi government was known to be making passable $20, $10, and $5 U.S. notes, and these counterfeiters are apparently still in business.</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><strong>Eat<br></strong><em>Masgouf-</em> Considered as the national dish of Iraq. It is an open cut freshwater fish roasted for hours after being marinated with olive oil, salt, curcuma and tamarind while keeping the skin on. Traditional garnishes for the masgouf include lime, chopped onions and tomatoes, and flatbread.</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><em>Tepsi Baytinijan</em> Also very popular dish in Iraq. A baked casserole typically consisting of meatballs, aubergine, tomatoes, garlic, onions, and potatoes.</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><strong>Drink. </strong>The legal drinking/purchasing age of alcoholic beverages is 18.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">Alcohol is widely available and street vendors can usually get alcohol if you really need it, but again this is just asking to be identified as an outsider. Furthermore, while alcohol is legal many insurgent groups in Iraq have targeted alcohol vendors and drinkers.</span><br><span class="acss38e22"><strong>Sleep<br></strong>Sleep in the hot summer months can be difficult. Sleeping outside and near flowing water is the most comfortable setting one can find outside of air conditioning.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">In Iraqi Kurdistan, there are plenty of hotels and although they are hard to find in any travel guide, anyone on the street will direct you to a nearby place. There’s no shortage in Zakho, Dohuk or Arbil. Rates run about 15 USD to 25 USD per night for a single room with bathroom.</span></p> <p><span class="acss38e22"><strong>Stay safe<br></strong>Iraq is beset with numerous problems that make traveling risky and difficult. The security situation is perilous in just about any area of the country, and continues to deteriorate under continuing terrorist attacks. Resistance to continuing military occupation, U.S. and UK forces, and Iraqi military, police or anyone associated with the Iraqi government, as well as increasing factional and sectarian conflict make street warfare, bombings, and other acts of armed violence daily occurrences.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">The central third of the country is the most volatile; the southern ports are less dangerous, but only relatively so. However, northern Iraq, or Kurdistan is safe and has suffered from very little violence since 2003. Major cities, including Baghdad, are fertile grounds for political upheavals, kidnappings, and other underground activity, so tread lightly. The Kurdish peshmerga (military) is over 100,000 strong and every road, town, city and even village has checkpoints going in and out. All non-Kurds are searched thoroughly and occasionally followed by the internal secret police. However fear not, this is why there is almost no chance of terrorism in the North. The police are friendly and everyone is happy to meet foreigners, especially Americans.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">Traveling alone makes you an easy kidnapping target, and is best avoided – if possible travel with a translator/guard. There are comprehensive private and state security services available for your personal protection – you are strongly advised to use the available options for your own safety. If employed in Iraq, consult your employer on how to handle your personal safety. Independent contractors will usually have security provided by their clients, if no security is provided you should seriously consider not traveling to Iraq, if you must go you should hire armed security and get proper training in appropriate protective gear, survival, and weapons.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">Be aware that Iraq, like the recently ended former war zone, has minefields everywhere especially in the desert, do not walk into fields, especially unmarked ones unless you’re absolutely sure that it’s safe.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">LGBT visitors. WARNING: Homosexual private acts are illegal under morality laws with punishments up to 7 years in jail, fines, torture, and deportation. Vigilante executions, beatings and torture are a daily occurrance with government officials joining in, being complicit, or turning a blind eye. No accommodations are LGBT friendly and you will be denied, killed, beaten, tortured, and jailed when they realize you’re gay. Discrimination, abuse, honour killings, and murder are still common. Attacks on anyone LGBT had risen greatly after the global withdrawal from Iraq and with ISIS invasion, and while ISIS was defeated in 2017 in Iraq, lethal threats remain for LGBT visitors. If you are gay, stay out of Iraq.</span></p> <p><span class="acss38e22"><strong>Stay healthy<br></strong>It is best to always drink bottled water. It will usually be sold at vendors and large stores, and will be easy to find. Most Iraqi water companies pump their water directly from the Tigris or Euphrates rivers, treat it with ozone, and then filter it into bottles. The taste is often not very good, and those with sensitive systems should not drink it. Many street vendors will offer drinks such as water with a lemon twist, which should be presumed unsafe for foreign visitors.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">Those with experience in Iraq should use their discretion and past experience when purchasing drinks.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">Drinking the local tea (chai) can be safe for some people since it is brought to a boil before serving, but when in doubt, insist that bottled water be used. Many kinds of water-borne disease, pollution, and infectious agents are not affected by boiling of water, and are still present in the water after boiling.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">As a walk past an Iraqi butcher shop will demonstrate, food preparation standards are not the same as in Western countries, and consumption of local food can make a visitor ill. Try to bring your own. As tap water is generally not potable, you should especially avoid uncooked foods.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">Should you find your body in the uncomfortable position of rejecting food and water due to something you shouldn’t have drunk, immediately find someone who speaks Arabic and send them to a local pharmacist and request a product known locally as “InterStop” (similar to co-phenotrope/Lomotil). This works better than any well-known western brands.</span></p> <p><span class="acss38e22"><strong>Respect<br></strong>Never show the soles of your feet to others. This may be considered very disrespectful by most Iraqis, unless you are in the company of friends. When in the company of friends, it’s still best to excuse yourself before putting your feet up in the air with the soles of your feet in the direction of any person.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">Don’t spit in public or in the direction of others, even when obviously done without malice.</span><br><span class="acss38e22">In most major cities, avoid addressing or glorifying the Saddam Hussein regime.</span></p> <p><span class="acss38e22"></span></p> <p> </p> <p><span class="acss38e22"></span></p><div class="printfriendly pf-button pf-button-content pf-alignleft"> <a href="index.html#" rel="nofollow" title="Printer Friendly, PDF &amp; Email"> <amp-img data-hero class="pf-button-img acss0a773 amp-wp-unknown-size amp-wp-unknown-width amp-wp-unknown-height amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://cdn.printfriendly.com/buttons/printfriendly-pdf-email-button-md.png" alt="Print Friendly, PDF &amp; Email" width="1000" height="400" layout="intrinsic"><amp-img fallback data-hero class="pf-button-img acss0a773 amp-wp-unknown-size amp-wp-unknown-width amp-wp-unknown-height amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://www.ronperrier.net/wp-content/plugins/accelerated-mobile-pages/images/SD-default-image.png" alt="Print Friendly, PDF &amp; Email" width="1000" height="400" layout="intrinsic"></amp-img></amp-img> </a> </div></div> </div> <div class="amp-wp-content"><amp-addthis width="320" height="92" data-pub-id="ra-5cc8551aa4f16f5c" data-widget-id="cwgj"></amp-addthis></div> <div class="amp-author "> <div class="amp-author-image "> <amp-img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3c3451d316b5692b4966ae213ea44ae08b389bb84a08c750a0997098e39c63d4?s=60&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g" width="60" height="60" layout="fixed"></amp-img> </div> <div class="author-details "><span class="author-name">admin</span><p>I would like to think of myself as a full time traveler. I have been retired since 2006 and in that time have traveled every winter for four to seven months. The months that I am "home", are often also spent on the road, hiking or kayaking.
