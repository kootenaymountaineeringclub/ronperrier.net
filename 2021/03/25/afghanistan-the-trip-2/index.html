However, in the last 40 years, the country has been in chaos due to major wars—from the Soviet invasion of 1979 to their withdrawal in 1989 and from warlordism to the removal of the Taliban in 2001 and the ensuing US/NATO invasion. Economically, Afghanistan is considered poor compared to many other nations of the world. The country is going through a nationwide rebuilding process.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Afghanistan has been in the news since the late 1970s for all the wrong reasons. While visiting has not been advisable for several years, it has much to offer the intrepid traveller. But even the more adventurous should consider looking elsewhere for thrill-seeking.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Tourism is a small industry in Afghanistan due to security issues. 20,000 foreign tourists visited annually as of 2016. <sup id="cite_ref-313" class="reference"></sup>In particular, an important region for domestic and international tourism is the picturesque Bamyan Valley, which includes lakes, canyons and historical sites, helped by the fact it is in a safe area away from insurgent activity. The Taliban destroyed most of the ancient 6th-century Buddhist sculptures of Bamiyan in a cultural crime that outraged the world. Today, what remains in the Bamiyan Valley is the silencing and still worthwhile sight of the empty niches. The salvaged pieces of what were once the largest statues of their kind in the world continue to provide a fascinating insight in the history of this place.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Smaller numbers visit and trek in regions such as the Wakhan Valley, which is also one of the world&#8217;s most remote communities. Ghazni, Bamyan, Herat, Kandahar, Balkh, and Zaranj are all very historic.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Band-e Amir National Park, with its six interlinked lakes, is perhaps the finest natural attraction. At an altitude of 2900 meters, the blue waters and sandy mountain sides. Near Bamiyan.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Excellent mosques are to be found all around, with particularly grand examples in Mazar-i-Sharif and in the rapidly developing Herat.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The Minaret of Jam is a UNESCO World Heritage site. The Hari River valley is well off the beaten path &#8211; possible as a roundtrip from Herat or when traversing the Central Route from Herat to Kabul.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Since the Taliban took control in 2022, Afghanistan is now safer than ever. Travellers are travelling solo with no guides and going to places previously off-limits. You can cross the border from Tajikistan, Iran and Pakistan by land &#8211; Peshawar-Jalalabad (Torkham border), Tajikistan to Afghanistan (Sheer Khan Bander border), and Mashhad-Herat (Dogharon border). You can enter by flight from Iran (Tehran, Mashad), Turkey (Istanbul) and Dubai. You can get a visa in all those places, some require an invitation letter while some do not. There is not any restrictions or discrimination for any type of passport holders</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Capital.</strong> Kabul <span id="coordinates"><span class="plainlinks nourlexpansion"><span class="geo-default"><span class="geo-dms" title="Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location"><span class="latitude">34°31′N</span> <span class="longitude">69°11′E<br /> </span></span></span></span></span><strong>Languages.</strong> Pashto, Dari</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Ethnic groups</strong>. 42% Pashtun, 27% Tajik, 9% Hazara, 9% Uzbek, 4% Aimaq, 3% Turkmen, 2% Baloch, 4% Others</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Currency.</strong> Afghan Afghani (AFN)</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Population.</strong> 36.6 million (2020)</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Country Code</strong>. +93</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Ethnic Groups</strong>. 42% Pashtun, 27% Tajik, 9% Hazara, 9% Uzbek, 4% Aimaq, 3% Turkmen, 2% Baloch, 4% others.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Religion.</strong> 99% Islam (official), 1% other</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Area.</strong> 652,867 <sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"></sup>km<sup>2</sup> (252,073 sq mi) (40th)</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Population.</strong> 652,867<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference">[19]</sup> km<sup>2</sup> (252,073 sq mi) (40th).

The office in Kabul is in Park Tower on the 2nd floor. A SIM and 10GB cost 600A. They offer an eSIM but a SIM card is registered online. <strong><br /> Climate. </strong>Temperatures in the central highlands are below freezing for most of the winter, and snow is common at higher elevations. Summertime highs in lower elevations (such as Jalalabad or Mazar-e Sharif) can exceed 50°C/120°F. In higher areas such as Kabul, summer temperatures can be 30°C/90°F and winter around 0°C/30°F. The most pleasant weather in Kabul is during April, May and September.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Terrain. </strong>Mostly rugged mountains; and plains in the north and southwest. The Hindu Kush mountains run northeast to southwest, dividing the northern provinces from the rest of the country, with the highest peaks in the northern Wakhan Corridor. South of Kandahar is desert.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The lowest point is Amu Darya at 258 m, and the highest is Nowshak at 7,485 m.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Afghanistan is bordered by Pakistan to the south and east, Iran to the west, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan to the north. There is a short border with China to the far northeast but in extremely inaccessible terrain.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>OBSERVATIONS ABOUT AFGHANISTAN</strong></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">1. Women have lost all rights. Girls go to school until grade six but not after and parents are not allowed to teach their children at home. A few women work in public health, other health care, and teachers and Roshan had female agents. Essentially, women are expected to stay at home and can&#8217;t go out without a male relative. It is such a waste of human resources. Many were well-educated during the American occupation.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">2. Jobs for non-Taliban men are limited. Very educated people can&#8217;t get promoted as uneducated Taliban advance. No one has been paid for two months and no one has money. The restaurant I eat at every night is empty and still has about 8 staff including the manager. He worked for 13 years in the government but was forced to quit. He now works 16-hour days.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The translator who helped me with my visa stamp didn&#8217;t expect to get married. His salary is about $10/day. It would cost $7,000 (a banquet for 300 and a large gift to the bride&#8217;s family is necessary). He supports his mother and three siblings, none of whom are working.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">3. The Taliban exerts complete control. There is no media, political opposition and no dissent. Before the Afghanistan war, strict Sharia law was enforced but now they don&#8217;t cut off people&#8217;s hands for theft. I was told to expect no favours. Whenever I ask locals questions about them, they lower their voices and make sure I don&#8217;t repeat what they say.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">International aid has all but dried up (UN aid is the only aid organization providing relief). The economy has decreased 40% since their control started. 40% of people are near famine. Unemployment is very high. </span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">It seems the Taliban are willing to starve their citizens and watch the economy go into freefall, all to enforce their severe form of Islam. A revolt would only produce a lot of death. The Taliban are everywhere and heavily armed. Most native Pashto speakers are Taliban. </span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">4. Begging. Of all the countries I have visited, only begging in Ethiopia is worse. Women with babies, old people, people with disabilities and especially children beg, I gave a little kid the pizza in my doggie bag and he was immediately robbed by a bigger kid.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">5. Driving here is similar to India and Bangladesh &#8211; whoever is ahead has the right of way and no other rules exist. Drivers are aggressive in getting ahead. Pedestrians have no rights. As expected, most cards have dents. </span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">6. Taxis are relatively cheap. I found it amazing how poor their knowledge of destinations was. It was necessary to have Google Maps to show them around. Unusually they actually could follow the map which is unusual. None spoke English so Google Translate is also necessary. </span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>INFORMATION</strong></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Do your research and know the risks involved. Study the history. Read about the geopolitical situation. Make sure your money goes directly to the local people. It is a difficult country to travel to. Many moments of boredom. Embrace that too. Afghans are used to this.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">No women in the photos. Since the TLB took over, many of their rights to employment, education, and public spaces were removed. Women in Afghanistan stay home unless they are out with their husbands or family or go to the bazaar. Sadly, the only ones encountered are beggars on the street in the remoter areas. Except for those who work at the airport, Afghan women are not allowed to speak to strangers or be photographed. It&#8217;s a male-dominated society and many tourists do not interact with a single woman during their entire trip.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Most tourists have no issues with the TLB but make sure to have the proper documentation in order. Never be grumpy or rude to the Taliban, especially at checkpoints. Even if it’s a slight annoyance, keep a positive, friendly attitude. Respect their religion and traditions – very conservative and once in Pashtun areas such as Helmand and Kandahar multiply that by ten. Keep political opinions to yourself, keep a very low profile, dress like a local, and ask for permission before taking photos.  Whatever you do, don’t lose your passport!<br /> <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Dress code.</strong> Although not mandatory, it is recommended to wear local clothing. Never wear shorts in public.<br /> I wore long pants and a T-shirt in Kabul as did some younger people. I don&#8217;t think it was a problem. I had no room in my pack, it would get dirty easily (they wear a clean one every day) and I didn&#8217;t want to waste the money.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>VISA</strong></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Note the visa application process changed on May 27, 2024. You now need to go to the Afghan visa site: econsulate.mfa.gov.af., fill out the simple application and print it to take to the embassy. Need a passport photo. </span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Peshawar:</strong> I applied on May 29 and it took a whole day with several taxis to sort it all out. With the proper form, the process in Peshawar can be fast.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">After checking your phone at the guard house, walk about 300 m past the long line of locals and enter the compound.

Since 2017, the border has been open and travellers can cross. This is easier in the Afghanistan &gt; Pakistan direction, and in either direction requires significant planning.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Torkham border crossing from Peshwar. </strong>Open 7 days/week. Officially closes at 9 pm &#8211; the Pakistani side sometimes randomly closes a bit earlier.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I tried to get a shared taxi from Peshawar bus station (Haji Camp Adda is the main bus station). My taxi took me to a market and I was left with little alternative than to take a single taxi for 2000 PR. He did not attempt to find other passengers. We stopped at a checkpoint where the soldier said it was very dangerous. He consulted his captain and finally let me through. Getting to the border seems much longer than the 48 km advertised. I was in a nice air-conditioned car. Instead of the advertised 2000A, he held up four fingers. So I gave him 4000 and he still wanted more because there were no other passengers.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Whoever wrote all the EPS reports I used to research Afghanistan lived in a different world than what I experienced. Jump the fence!!!!!! What a crazy idea. I did get adopted by a guy who helped quite a bit, especially getting the immigration stamp where we bypassed the line. Here are the things I had to show and do: 1. Show your Pakistan visa at least three times. 2. Declare your money. I got the idea that more than US$1,000 was not allowed. I showed them one wallet where I had about $700 but I had much more hidden in my pack. I had to take a photo of the declaration. 3. Immigration. They recorded all the details of my Pakistan visa. 4. Intelligence. He repeated everything again. 5. Filled out a long form and had to provide 2 passport photos. 6. Polio vaccination. My vaccine certification was deep in my pack so I got a booster for polio.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">To get to this point was a long walk through a corridor fenced with wire. We pushed our way past hundreds of others – guys pushing big carts full of sacks of rice, luggage and you name it, and many people in wheelchairs (mostly women with kids and older men). This took about two hours. It was shaded but still very hot and long.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">After that, my experience improved. I had met Abdullah in the visa office in Peshawar. Born in Dubai of Afghan parents, he had lived in Germany for several years and was a successful businessman. He did not look Afghani. By luck, we met again at immigration and we navigated the gauntlet together. He was being met at the border by his brother and two cousins and they generously gave me a ride to Jalalabad. The AC in the car didn’t work but no big problem. After a month in hot climates, I was quite acclimatized. I have no idea about getting a share taxi to Kabul.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">They were all great guys who spoke fair English. We talked a lot about sex and having 4 wives. I was given the formula for penis improvement – boil milk for at least 5 minutes with saffron, crushed dates and nuts (almond, walnuts, peanuts) and let it sit for two weeks. Abdullah&#8217;s brother who was 44 and had 8 kids swore by it.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">They all wanted to come to Canada but had no understanding of how difficult it was. They don’t understand that it doesn’t have much to do with who you know but is more merit-based. One wanted to find a Canadian woman but again had no idea of how liberated most Western women are.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Abdullah and his relatives dropped me off at a market in Jalalabad where I got a share taxi for 400 but only to the outskirts of Kabul. There were four of us and one guy spoke good English. It was a great conversation about everything, especially women and freedom. They were all happy with Taliban rule but mostly because they had peace. From all my travels through countries that have been at war, this counts the most.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">They think that women should have more access to education and that is one they have given up. Women are also not allowed to have female friends outside the family?? But they all believed that women’s place is in the home and are not allowed to have any male friends. Women on the edge of the country (Mazr, Herat) have more freedom. None wanted more than one wife. The Taliban has enforced the support of women and children if there is a divorce, as it says to do in the Quarin. Do you want to have more than one wife? One was not married, two had one wife (and only wanted one) and the driver (who also owned this Toyota car) had two wives (he liked sex too much to have only one).</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I admitted that this is a very personal question “Do Afghani men like to satisfy their women sexually (ie have orgasms)&#8221;, and he wouldn’t answer.</span></p><p><em><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The road followed the Kabul River the whole way – through a wide valley and a large river, then into a canyon that got progressively narrower. We passed a dam pouring a lot of water and then the reservoir it formed. We climbed over a high pass, stopped at a town and then a narrower canyon with a much smaller river. Then there was a climb up many switchbacks and tunnels on a road constructed out of the cliff.</span></em><br /> <em><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Just before the main city of Kabul, there was a major checkpoint. I couldn’t find the entrance stamp after several good looks. I am sure that I got a stamp at Afghan immigration in Torkham. He brought the boss and they went to a higher boss. The threat was that I would have to return to Torkham, 5 hours back with a good car. After pleading my case, they finally let me go “Don’t do that again.” Crazy – this is the first time that has ever happened (except at the Bulgarian / Turkey border but that is another story).</span></em><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><em>Everyone else got out and I continued into Kabul for another 300A</em><strong><br /> ON </strong>Kyber Hotel.1500. Includes a fair breakfast served in the restaurant on the 5th floor. No AC for this room but it is enclosed on the 2nd floor and is not needed. With a fan, I was quite comfortable. The staff are not as helpful as one would think with so many tourists staying. They can&#8217;t give much advice on where to buy a SIM card or where to get share taxis to travel. I think most tourists have guides that look after all these things.<br /> I have met 3 Canadians, and several Australians staying here. They are all in traditional Afghan clothes but it is easy to tell them apart as all are fat. </span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>KABUL<br /> </strong>Kabul has been the capital of Afghanistan since about 1776. The city was badly damaged during the various 1979–2001 wars, particularly its western parts. For a few years, Kabul has been going through a period of reconstruction and development, with some modern-style tower blocks and a handful of glitzy shopping malls appearing. Many roads, particularly the main feeder routes, have been reconstructed and upgraded. However, in outlying areas, roads and other infrastructure remain in poor condition. Electricity supplies in Kabul are now quite reliable.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Seeing downtown Kabul is relatively compact and walkable &#8211; a good option in the spring and fall &#8211; summers bring intolerable heat and dust, whilst winters bring snow and mud. Pavements are few, and you need to keep your wits about you when crossing roads.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Wazar Akbar Khan and Taimani (to a restaurant, etc.) is fine day or night. Central Kabul at night is walkable but be sure you know where you are going, and how to get back to your guesthouse. Given the volatile security situation always be aware of any demonstrations, gathering crowds, etc., which could spiral out of control quickly. Keep a low profile, wear simple clothes and (for women), cover your hair with a scarf or shawl. It is also wise to vary your routes frequently to reduce the threat of kidnapping. People are generally helpful and polite if you ask for directions.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Be wary walking around traditional residential areas (e.g., near the city wall). Conservative Afghans are suspicious of anyone snooping around their house, and children may throw stones or set their dog on you.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Kabul Airport (KBL)</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Day 2</strong> Fri May 31</span><br /> <em><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">It was Friday and everything was closed.

I was advised to go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The area of government offices is in a massive compound surrounded by immense blast walls topped with a fence and razor wire. After going through security twice and leaving ID, I visited three offices but none could help. They advised me to go to the border police and a nice guy who worked as a translator accompanied me. He only knew the general direction and we walked at least 5 km in a circuitous route. He asked for directions several times and we had to pass through many checkpoints. </em></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><em>The border police said the only option was to return to Torkham. That would mean a 6-hour drive each way and the use of my Pakistan visa. I said that I would leave Afghanistan and not return. He said I had to go to the Ministry of the Interior near the airport and get a letter. With it, I could travel around Afghanistan. Before returning to Pakistan, it was necessary to get another letter from the border police to exit Afghanistan. The translator who accompanied me wanted a tip. He suggested $50!!!!!

As I needed the letter from the Ministry of the Interior, I took a taxi there and after several security checks, arrived at an office in block 310. I was led to a very opulent office and then the office of the boss. He eventually provided me with a letter allowing me to travel anywhere in Afghanistan without a stamp.</em><br /> I then tried to get my travel permits. The addresses for Afghan Tours (this doesn&#8217;t exist) and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism were wrong which I found out after a long walk. I returned to the hotel and looked at recent posts for Afghanistan. A great one gave the addresses for both the Ministry and the Travel Directory who could issue a permit for any or all of the 34 provinces for free. I went and obtained 5 permits in about 10 minutes.<br /> I then finally started to see some of the NM sites in Kabul.<br /> <strong>OMAR Mine Museum. </strong>This is a great museum with some very unusual things. Five cars include a Beetle, Peugout, a 1929 and1992 Mercedes and an amazing Ford that is hard to believe, a Ford Classic 1992.<br /> Most unusual were a wooden motorcycle and a wooden bicycle. Then there was an enormous collection of mines &#8211; anti-personal, jump, fragmentation, tripwire, claymore, and anti-vehicle and tank along with anit-mining equipment (they have cleared millions of mines). initially, there were about 200 injuries and deaths from mines and there are still 40/month. There are also RPGs (rocket-propelled grenades, heated guided missiles, many kinds of mortars, fuses, bullets, and grenades. Those and the many planes and helicopters are mostly Russian.<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">500 A</span><br /> I was interviewed by an Afghan TV station.<br /> <strong>Pul-e Khishti Bazaar</strong> &#8211; there are many markets near the mosque &#8211; Bird Market, Kabul Market and Pashtun Market.<br /> <strong>Ka Faroshi Bird Market</strong> &#8211; Where Bacha Broot is. There are only a few big chickens.<br /> <strong>Bacha Broot. </strong>Kabul’s oldest restaurant has served delicious <em>chainaki</em> — traditional lamb stew — for over 70 years. Named after the original owner who had peculiar facial hair, is from the Dari, meaning “boy with a mustache.” Very little has changed inside. The claustrophobic stairs, the sparse interior, the tiny door easily missed in the maze-like bazaar. C<em>hainaki</em> — lamb on the bone, split peas, and onions cooked for four hours in tiny teapots.<br /> To get to Bacha Broot, one must first walk past the Pul e Khishti mosque. After the mosque, the bird cages appear. Take a right where they sell roosters the size of a four-year-old child, The bazaar is packed at any time of the day. After the carpet shops, there is a tiny laneway, with a sign reading: “The best <em>chainaki</em> from goat meat.” Climb the stairs, two rooms: one for women and one for men. Faridoon Bacha Broot, 37, one of the three brothers now in charge of their father’s business.<br /> We make about two hundred servings of <em>chainaki</em> every day,” Wahidullah says. “We cut the meat, cook it, and distribute it in these teapots, <em>naan</em>, a traditional flatbread, and <em>doogh</em>, a savoury yogurt drink..<br /> It was delicious.

He almost immediately recognized that I didn&#8217;t have an entry stamp. He gave my passport and phone to his very young associate. He went to prayers in Pul e Khishti mosque and we started a long walk to &#8220;check my passport&#8221;. &#8220;No problem&#8221; is the Taliban&#8217;s favourite saying, usually when there is a big problem. He ate some corn and a cup of chickpeas before arriving at a restaurant. We had tea and two heavily armed soldiers in balaclavas entered. One gave me a vigorous frisk. We got into a Land Cruiser and drove towards the National Museum, eventually turning into a heavily fortified area. A blindfold was put on me. We went up some stairs to a small office to see the boss, a short, fat Taliban. I explained that I had a letter about the missing stamp but they had no interest in going to the hotel where I had left it.<br /> A crowd kept coming and going &#8211; two guys prayed. They emptied my pockets and put everything in a plastic bag in a desk. They wondered why I had so little money (several hundred in US$ and Afgnanis was in my secret pocket but none of the several frisks found it). I talked on the phone with a guy who said it would be 2-3 hours. Eight guys arrived and five eventually ate on the floor. We got ready to leave and I made sure they brought my wallet, passport and money in the desk (there were several other plastic bags with other people&#8217;s stuff).<br /> We got back into an older Land Cruiser to see the chief. I wasn&#8217;t blindfolded on the exit. It was a long drive to a compound on the other side of the mountain. I was left in a room with a lovely carpet and cushions. I slept. After prayers and about 70 minutes, 12 Taliban entered the room. The chief (a guy about 45 with a short beard) looked at my permit letter and then told me I was required to have a translator. &#8220;Learn about our culture and forget Google Maps and Google Translate&#8221;. I said that I would be leaving Afghanistan. I was then allowed to leave and was driven to the Kyber Hotel, The whole escapade took about 4 1/2 hours.

The fourth-largest city of Afghanistan and the capital of Balkh province, it is linked by highways with Kunduz in the east, Kabul in the southeast, Herat in the southwest and Termez in Uzbekistan in the north. It is about 55 km (34 mi) from the Uzbek border. The city also serves as one of the many tourist attractions because of its famous shrines and the Islamic and Hellenistic archeological sites. The ancient city of Balkh is also nearby.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The region around Mazar-i-Sharif has been historically part of Greater Khorasan and was controlled by the Tahirids followed by the Saffarids, Samanids, Ghaznavids, Ghurids, Ilkhanates, Timurids, and Khanate of Bukhara until the mid-18th century when it became part of the Durrani Empire.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Mazar-i-Sharif is the regional hub of northern Afghanistan, located close to both Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.

Back at the gardens, I saw the Green Mosque.<br /> </span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>CITY OF BALKH</strong> (antique Bactria) Tentative WHS (17/08/2004). Comprises a large urban site of 11 square kilometres, west of Mazar I Sharif, and about 46 miles south of the Amu Darya (Oxus) river whose course ran close to the city in antiquity.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The foundation of the city of Paktra, later known as Bactria is ascribed to Kaiomars, and at an early date it was said to have rivalled urban centres such as Babylon. For a long period, Bactria was the spiritual centre for the Zoroastrian religion, as well as having a rich temple to the goddess Anahita. Accounts of visitors in the 7th century AD indicate the existence of a significant number of Buddhist monasteries, stupas and other monuments in the city. Subsequent accounts from the 10th century AD indicate that the city was ringed with earthen walls, with six gates, within which was a fine citadel and a mosque.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The city became a centre for education, and in 980 AD the philosopher-scientist Ibn Sina was born in Balkh, as was the poet Ferdowsi. Its reputation as a place of learning persisted, judging by accounts of travellers in the 12th century AD, who describe a range of educational establishments, as well as its importance as a trading centre for the region, with links to India and China. Even though the city was sacked by Jenghiz Khan in 1220, when the inhabitants were said to have been slaughtered and all buildings levelled, and again by Timur in the 14th century, the traveller Marco Polo described Balkh a century later as a “noble city and great”.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Today, the traces of Balkh’s earthen walls can still be seen over a length of some 10 kilometres, to the north of which lies a secondary fortified area, the Balu Hisar. Remains that survive within this walled enclosure include Tepe Zargaran, an artificial mound with levels dating from at least the 2nd century AD, the tiled Timurid shrine of Khwaja Abu Nasr Parsa, which dates from 1460/1 and the 17th-century Madrasa of Sayyid Sudhan Quli Khan, of which one iwan with tiled decoration survives.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Outside of the walled city enclosure, buildings of the Buddhist period seem to have proved more durable than those of the Islamic era, with the remains of Tahkti-Rustam, the ruins of a Buddhist monastery of Nau Bahar and the associated stupa of Tepe Rustam, of which an earth-brick base of some 40 metres in diameter survives. To the north-east lie traces of extensive gardens, in which there was a large caravanserai.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Some 3 kilometres to the south lies the mosque of Haji Piyada, a Samanid-style building dating from the second half of the 9th century. The remains of the building show a small structure of nine equal bays, each of which had a brick dome, all of which have collapsed. The piers and springing of the arches that once supported the domes, retain fine decorated brick and stucco work, which is stylistically similar to Abbasid decorative work found in Mesopotamia.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">It was the birthplace of Zoroaster, the founder of Zoroastrianism – and Rumi, the legendary Persian poet.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Masjid Sabz</strong> (Green Mosque), Balkh. A large mosque with a great facade of blue/white tiles. It couldn&#8217;t be entered. I was required to show my permit twice.<br /> With a local, we got a taxi back to Mazar 250A</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Shrine of Ali (The Blue Mosque). </strong><i>Mazar-i-Sharif</i> means &#8220;Tomb of the Prince&#8221;, a reference to the large, blue-tiled sanctuary and mosque in the center of the city. Some people believe that the tomb of Ali ibn Abi Talib, is the cousin and son-in-law of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Ali&#8217;s remains were transferred to Mazar-i-Sharif as per the request of Ja&#8217;far as-Sadiq. This is however rejected by other Muslims, as the majority believe he is buried in Najaf, Iraq.<br /> At the front gate, I was refused entry and walked around the large complex to a second gate. Alam talked to the guards and they let me in. Go first to the office to have permits checked and sign the register. The museum 20A had little interest. The exterior is covered by a huge variety of mosaic panels. I was not allowed in and Alam took several videos. I could see Ali&#8217;s tomb, a wonderful blue glass with a lot of gilt. The interior was also a riot of different tile patterns.<br /> We went to eat but there was little choice. I wanted very little and Alan tried to order it but ended up getting a huge plate of biryani that we only ate half of but they charged for the smaller version.<br /> I bought a lovely scarf for Anna and took a cab to the airport.

When tourism was more active in Afghanistan, it was a magnet for generations of foreign visitors looking for Afghan exotica. For decades, the only thing missing has been chickens.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Now it is also missing foreigners. Customers of any sort are thin on the ground. On some days it’s so bad, that even the beggars don’t bother to come to work, and the touts scarcely stir from their stoops.<br /> The range of merchandise remains eclectic and sometimes disturbing. Snow leopard pelt, flintlock rifles, camel saddlebags, kilims, suzanis, chain mail shirts and Tartar helmets. Almost anything can be found carved from lapis lazuli, a semiprecious, deep blue gemstone native to Afghanistan.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Outside, the mouthwatering smell of kebabs grilling mingles with the odour of raw waste running down open sewers. Chicken Street&#8217;s boom occurred right after the American-led invasion in 2001 and many tiny shops were replaced with multistoried emporiums, homes to dozens of shops each. But they didn’t build new sewers.<br /> There were few restaurants and little street food. I was the only tourist. I could only find one real restaurant and had Badgan, a delicious eggplant dish.

The Sultani Gallery is attached.<br /> The museum was still interesting and covered the entire history of Afghanistan. I experience a horrifying incident. There were two school groups, one of several very sweet girls about 6 years old. One little girl looked at a drawer and the male teacher kicked as hard as he could across the legs and then hit her with his hand violently across her back. The kid didn&#8217;t even cry.

(Garden of Babur) is a historic park in Kabul and the final resting place of the first Mughal emperor Babur. The garden is thought to have been developed around 1528 AD (935 AH) when Babur gave orders for the construction of an &#8220;avenue garden&#8221; in Kabul, described in some detail in his memoirs, the Baburnama.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">It was the tradition of Mughal princes to develop sites for recreation and pleasure. In 1607 AD, all gardens in Kabul had walls. A prayer platform was laid in front of Babur&#8217;s grave, and an inscribed headstone was placed at its head. Shah Jahan in 1638 built a mosque and a stone water channel that ran between an avenue of trees from the terrace below the mosque, with pools at certain intervals.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><bdi class="vcard"><bdi class="note listing-content">Historically, the gardens have been visited by Afghans for picnics and lazy afternoons. There is a swimming pool, a small mosque for prayers and a small museum.<br /> </bdi></bdi></span>The garden was a complete reconstruction as everything had been destroyed. Enclosed in a high reconstructed wall, there is a good museum that explains a lot about Babur (1483-1530). He was born in the Fergan Valley in Uzbekistan. He was the first Mughal Emporer. He captured Kabul in 1504 at age 21 and eventually went to India. He died in Agra in 1530 but his body was relocated here in 1540.<br /> Walk up the long central stairs that cross 14 terraces. There are some rose bushes but basically it is grass and trees. Several groups of children were playing. The tomb of Babur is enclosed in a modern low compound. His marble grave (not the original) is inside a wonderful white marble wall of jali screens. There are three other graves including his son. Below the tomb is the Shah Jehan Mosque. Also reconstructed, it is all white marble open on three sides. Shah Jehan had visited here in 1630 and ordered the mosque constructed in honour of his victory over the Uzbek ruler of Balkh. 350A<br /> <strong>Kabul Zoo.</strong><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> V</span><bdi class="vcard"><bdi class="note listing-content">ery popular with Afghans, with over 100 animals in relatively poor condition.

(Zuhak City or the Red City), is a historic city ruin (foundations dating back to the 6th century) in Bamyan which was once home to 3,000 people. This city used to be a primary defence for the basin. <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"></sup>The citadel was destroyed by Genghis Khan. Built by the Ghorids, they stand on f. Genghis Khan&#8217;s grandson was killed here, bringing down his murderous fury on the whole Bamiyan valley as a result.<br /> The imposing ruins guard the entrance to the Bamiyan valley, perched high on the cliffs at the confluence of the Bamiyan and Kalu rivers. The towers of the citadel are some of the most dramatic in Afghanistan. Made of mud-brick on stone foundations, they wrap around the side of the cliff, with geometric patterns built into their crenellations for decoration. The towers had no doors but were accessed by ladders that the defenders pulled up behind them. Passing the towers, a path leads up through a rock tunnel and the main gateway of the fortress, before switching back up the hill, past ruined barracks and storerooms. A rusting anti-aircraft gun and abandoned soldier&#8217;s post-market the summit. The views over the confluence of the two rivers are awesome, with their thin strips of cultivated green providing a stark contrast to the dry pink and tan of the mountains. The location&#8217;s strategic value is immediately apparent, and the heights are seemingly impregnable to all except Genghis.<br /> Shahr-e Zohak is around 9km from Bamiyan. To get there take any westbound transport out of Bamiyan. As the confluence of the Bamiyan and Kalu rivers is where the roads from the Shibar and Hajigak Passes meet, any transport should be able to drop you there. Ask to be let out at Tupchi village (Afg40, 25 minutes) or the checkpoint at Shashpul half a kilometre after it, which is next to the confluence. The soldiers here will check you have a ticket from the Director of Information and Culture in Bamiyan. From here, walk about 1km following the Kalu, until you can see a simple wood-and-earth bridge, roughly level with the last of the citadel&#8217;s towers (if your vehicle is going in the Hajigak Pass direction &#8211; the nearest villages to ask for are Dahane Khushkak, Paymuri or Sawzaw &#8211; you can be dropped at this point). A short walk along the edge of a field brings you to a pass leading up to the towers.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Band-E-Amir National Park</strong>. Tentative WHS: (08/09/2004). It is the first national park of Afghanistan. It is a stunning group of five turquoise lakes separated by natural dams made of travertine. You can walk around the lakes, hike up to several viewpoints, boat, and shisha lounges.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">They are high in the Hindu Kush at an altitude of 2900m, and about 6,000 local tourists visit the site each year. Very remote and desolate, they are most easily visited from Bamiyan.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Get there. Shared minivans leave in the high season on Thursday afternoon and Friday morning and cost 150 Af. Otherwise, take a minivan towards Yakawlang (200 Af) and get off at the turn-off to the lakes. From there it&#8217;s a 3-hour hot walk&#8230; bring some water.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Private hire minivans are also available (3 hours) and <i>should</i> cost 2000-2500 Af, but you will have to bargain very hard for this price. You could also negotiate an overnight stay into the price for a little extra. he scenery is stunning.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">See. All services at the lakes close up around mid-November and reopen around March. Walking is pretty much the only way to get around the area once you arrive</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">If staying overnight, try to be up on the road at the top of Band-e Haibat at sunrise (in October the ideal time was 06:00) for some great views and, if the water is calm, some gorgeous reflections of the surrounding mountains in the lake. A trail from behind Hotel de Reves leads up the hill, and a 20-minute walk brings you to some stunning views of 2 more of the lakes.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The small mosque-like tomb of Amir looks over Band-e Haibat, and unfortunately, there are 5 tacky swans, and peddle boats available for rent here&#8230; a good opportunity to ruin the beautiful reflections in the lake.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Behind the tomb of Amir is a women&#8217;s beach, with a hut built half into the water, allowing women to enjoy a bath in the lake covered by curious views. Taking a bath in the lake is said to cure diseases (though a lot of rubbish in and around the lake may lead one to fear the opposite).</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Hotel de Reves (dream hotel). ambitiously named, has 3 <i>very</i> basic dirty rooms. A more private room is also just mats on the floor, most people prefer the much warmer main room at Dir.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Land mines used to be prevalent around this area, especially along the road that leads in from Bamiyan.

The third-largest city of Afghanistan, it is situated in the fertile valley of the Hari River in the western part of the country. It is linked with Kandahar, Kabul and Mazar-i-Sharif via Highway 1 or the ring road. It is further linked to the city of Mashhad in neighbouring Iran through the border town of Islam Qala, and to Mary in Turkmenistan to the north through the border town of Torghundi.</span></div></div></div></div></div></div><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Herat dates back to Avestan times and was traditionally known for its wine. The city has a number of historic sites, including the Herat Citadel and the Musalla Complex. During the Middle Ages Herat became one of the important cities of Khorasan, as it was known as the <i>Pearl of Khorasan</i>. After the conquest of Tamerlane, the city became an important center of intellectual and artistic life in the Islamic world. Under the rule of Shah Rukh, the city served as the focal point of the Timurid Renaissance, whose glory matched Florence of the Italian Renaissance as the center of a cultural rebirth.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">After the fall of the Timurid Empire, Herat has been governed by various Afghan rulers since the early 18th century.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Herat lies on the ancient trade routes of the Middle East, Central and South Asia, and today is a regional hub in western Afghanistan. The roads from Herat to Iran, Turkmenistan, and other parts of Afghanistan are still strategically important. As the gateway to Iran, it collects a high amount of customs revenue for Afghanistan. It also has an international airport (HEA). The city has high residential density clustered around the core of the city. Today the city is considered to be relatively safe.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>City of Herat </strong>Tentative WHS: (17/08/2004). The city of Herat, currently the capital of western Afghanistan, has long been of strategic, commercial and cultural significance to the wider region. It is unique in that it has largely retained its historical footprint, and many significant Islamic monuments have survived.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Established around 500 BC as the ancient Persian town of Artacoana or Aria, in the fertile plain beside the Hari Rud river. Captured by Alexander the Great in 330 BC during his war against the Achaemenids, the town was developed and a citadel was built. The site retained its strategic importance, and was an important asset for the Seleucids, Parthians and Hephthalites, before becoming the western bastion of the Abbasid caliphate at the end of the 8th century AD. By the time of its capture by the Ghorids in 1175 AD, Herat had become renowned for the production of metalwork, especially decorated or inlaid bronze. After destruction at the hands of both the Mongols and Genghis Khan, Herat saw something of a renaissance in the late 14th century AD, under the rule of the son of Timur, Shah Rukh, who began an extensive programme of building. This was followed by extensive development ordered by Queen Gawharshad during the 15th century AD, which resulted in a remarkable and unique ensemble of monuments in the Timurid style.</span><br style="font-size: 16px;" /><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The residential quarters of Herat were developed in a manner that responds to the specific climatic and social needs of the inhabitants. A complex network of alleys leads to fine houses built around open courtyards, or small gardens, or to the many mosques, synagogues, schools, public baths, or reservoirs that dot the urban fabric.</span><br style="font-size: 16px;" /><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Apart from its architectural heritage, Herat has long been an important centre for the arts and sciences, with a rich tradition of music, calligraphy and painting, astronomy, mathematics and philosophy.<br /> </span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Jihad Museum</strong></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Herat Citadel. </strong>One of the oldest extant structures in the historic core of Herat is Qala e Ikhtyaruddin, built on the site of an ancient citadel thought to have been established by Alexander in around 330 BC. The layout of battlements and towers that survive is thought to date from the early 14th century AD when the Karts rebuilt a fortress that had been destroyed by the Mongols. Situated at the northern edge of the square-plan old city, the citadel was during the 15th and 16th centuries AD the seat of the Timurid rulers and was part of the architectural works undertaken by Shah Rukh, who commissioned the tilework that can still be seen on several towers. The citadel underwent conservation in the 1970s.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Musalla Complex. </strong>Built in the early 15th century under the direction of Queen Gawharshad, it is perhaps the largest historic architectural ensemble that survives in the region today.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The mausoleum complex of Khwaja Abdulla Ansari in Gozargah dates from the Timurid period and contains Ansari’s grave, a 16th-century structure that retains some fine Timurid tilework, and is where the unique black marble Haft Qalam sarcophagus, dating from the reign of Sultan Husain Baiqara (1468-1506) is situated. Other surviving parts of the complex are the late 15th century AD Zarnegar pavilion, whose interior has fine painted decoration on plaster, and a 17th century AD Namakdan, a decagonal building with vaulted balconies, overlooking the Timurid garden.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">It is described as “the most beautiful example in colour in architecture ever devised by man to the glory of his God and himself” and was dynamited by the British Indian Army in 1885 to prevent their use as a fortress if the Russian army tried to invade. The tomb and minarets are still standing.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Today comprises a mosque, the mausoleum of Gawharshad, five minarets and the remains of the madrasa of Hussein Baiqara. Although damaged during fighting in the early 1990s, the mausoleum of Gawharshad retains its ribbed tiled dome, which is set above a high drum covered in tiled decoration, both with Koranic inscriptions and abstract patterns. The interior of the structure, where the tombstones of the Queen, her son Baisunghur and other members of the family survive, has important painted and stucco ornamentation. Only one minaret, which is badly damaged and is being stabilized, remains of the entrance to a madrasa complex that was associated with the musalla, which had a total of four minarets, and represents the zenith of Timurid architectural achievement.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>The Masjid-e Jami</strong> dates from an original 10th-century AD Ghorid mosque, which has been extended and renovated through the ages. A unique Ghorid portal with tiled calligraphic and geometric decoration survives south of the existing main entrance of the mosque, which follows a typical four-iwan pattern, with a huge central courtyard. Fragments of both Timurid and Ghorid decorative work survive in the main iwan of the complex, but these are now under threat from ill-conceived “improvements”, as it the traditional earth-plastered roof, that has been recently replaced with a cement finish.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Herat bazaar</strong></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Soviet Tank Monument</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>MINARET AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL REMAINS OF JAM </strong>World Heritage Site.

Covered in elaborate brickwork with a blue tile inscription at the top, it is noteworthy for the quality of its architecture and decoration, which represent the culmination of an architectural and artistic tradition in this region.

Rising to 65m from a 9m diameter octagonal base, its four superimposed, tapering cylindrical shafts are constructed from fired bricks. The Minaret is completely covered with geometric decoration in relief enhanced with a Kufic inscription in turquoise tiles. Built-in 1194 by the great Ghurid Sultan Ghiyas-od-din (1153-1203), its emplacement probably marks the site of the ancient city of Firuzkuh, believed to have been the summer capital of the Ghurid dynasty. The Ghurids controlled Afghanistan, eastern Iran, Central Asia, northern India and parts of Pakistan. It is a victory tower declaring the power of Islam.<br /> Surrounding remains include a group of stones with Hebrew inscriptions from the 11th to 12th centuries on the Kushkak hill, and vestiges of castles and towers of the Ghurid settlements on the banks of the Hari River as well as to the east of the Minaret.<br /> </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">ON near minaret.<br /> <strong>Getting there and back.</strong> From both Herat and Baniyan, first get to Chagcheran. </span></span><span style="font-size: 16px;">From Heriat is a terrible road taking about 10 hours and from Bamiyan, a difficult 8-hour drive requires a private 4-wheel vehicle. </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">From Chageheran. it is a 4-hour drive to where you must walk.

Safe but are terrorizing people and causing serious issues in an otherwise peaceful country. Taliban are very reserved when interacting with women. Taliban seem to make up the rules as they go &#8211; so you may run into the wrong guy.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The Taliban feel hate and lack of respect for women. Leave your political opinions at home. Hard if not impossible to go from province to province without a local.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The evolution of risk and security is following a very similar pattern as the one that was in place before the Taliban took over. There are numerous foreigners in detention at one time. Cities: relatively safe. Countryside: relatively unsafe.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Southern Afghanistan &#8211; being a Taliban stronghold it was unsafe before but relatively safe now (e.g. Helmand) and is the safest area in the country right now. Totally reversed compared to 2 years ago and the only major change. The south is problematic for other reasons (Taliban-mafia-type issues) so you can easily get detained for a while and held without reason. The remote mountain areas of Nangarhar is where IS-K is known to operate.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Eastern Afghanistan: Was not ok (Jalalabad itself is fine but Kunar and Nangarhar provinces are where ISIS was the most active. In early 2024, ISIS has been well controlled and most have left the country.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">North Afghanistan: it depends The Hazarajat is fine, as is most of the north and west.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Dress code</strong>: Men: local outfit is required (kameez). Women: abaya and hijab</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>GET IN<br /> </strong>Immigration on arrival in Kabul: Fill in an arrival card and need a single passport photo.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Departure out of Kabul &#8211; traffic in Kabul is terrible so start your journey to the airport in good time. 4-5 baggage scans and 2 temperature checks.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><em>Flights.</em> From Islamabad on KAM air and out to Dubai on KAM air. 300 US$ each way.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>GET AROUND<br /> </strong>If you take local transport, they check the papers of everyone on board.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Planes.</strong> Daily flights from Herat, Kandahar and Mazar to Kabul with Kam Air and Ariana. Price doesn’t vary based on demand or time of booking, and tickets rarely seem to sell out. Book through tourist agencies.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Shared taxis</strong> (faster but more likely to get stopped at checkpoints)</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Buses.</strong> If doing everything by road, the infrastructure is so bad (potholes; traffic, roadblocks, checkpoints, more potholes), and flights reasonably cheap, that flying domestically is often best. The bus from Herat to Kandahar takes almost nine hours; Mazar to Herat by road takes almost 24 hours due to bad roads. The Northwestern Ring highway, in particular, is very bad. It is very uncomfortable, and you arrive at your destination tired. You have less time to see things.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Use taxis and private car hire for Mazar. In Herat everything is walkable.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Money.</strong> No issues changing US$/EUR in the cities. Prefer new 100 US$ bills, but 50 US$ bills are OK, but the rate changes. Struggle with smaller denominations. Credit cards don’t work.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Costs.</strong> Depends on if using local flights or share taxis and buses. As little as 80 US$/day to 400US$/day with Untamed Borders.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Accommodation. </strong>Price and quality of hotels vary a lot, and the two aren’t necessarily correlated. A lot of hotels mentioned online are also impossible to find on Google Maps, don’t have contact details listed and/or have shut down.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Couchsurfing works well to find locals, check people’s references, many locals use Couchsurfing as a way to get themselves known not as a place to stay.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Food.</strong> Good in Kabul and Mazar. chicken kebab, vegetarian dishes. Coffee is hard to find so bring a jar of instant. On long drives, food is not always available to buy on the side of the road.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Juma (Friday).</strong> All governmental offices close. Plan your registration on a Wednesday in case something goes wrong as they close at 12 on Thursdays.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Cameras.</strong> No Cameras at the two main blue shrines in Kabul and Mazar. The Taliban hold cameras. Use a tiny camera so as not to attract attention, for example, a Fuji x100v.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>GUIDES<br /> </strong><strong>1. Local Guides.</strong> To focus on food, photography, and conversations with locals, go with a different guide for every city &#8211; get expert knowledge of each place from someone who lives there and knows their city/province well. Save on costs because the guides do not need to fly around the country with you, and don’t need to pay for their accommodation. Not stuck with a horrible guide for the duration of your stay. A lot more interesting, since you forge a connection and money goes directly to the guide. Many guides are paid very little by tour companies or middlemen even if they are the ones doing all the work.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">When planning your trip, speak to the guides directly. Get references. Speak to other travellers. Many people are scammed. Local guides will completely understand what you want, make everything easier, and become friends.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Travelling independently without a guide is not recommended &#8211; TLB checkpoints are everywhere, and absolutely no way you can communicate with the soldiers. Throughout the country, you will struggle to find anyone who speaks English. Hire a guide. This is a very poor country, and that money can go a long way for them, and you will have a more enriching experience. Some trips are best experienced with locals, and this is one of them.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The standard rate is US$50-75 per day plus you pay for their meals and transport and accommodation and flights (if you’re spending the night outside of their home base).</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><em>Mazar/Bamiyan</em>: Obaid Ullah Salar (WhatsApp +93778426816) &#8211; speaks English, Pashto and Persian</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><em>Helmand/Kandahar</em>: Ehsan Khan (WhatsApp +93706950059) &#8211; speaks English, Pashto and Urdu</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><em>Herat:</em> Ehsan Rahmatian (WhatsApp +93796626164) &#8211; speaks English and Persian</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>2.</strong>. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1699302117062993/user/728811346/?__cft__%5b0%5d=AZVeeMZYc1DYZj-ZPFctfwkJDb58soEGseZM9eVIvoB_a2PiSjGbrFmPpg93pCd0zLiuqy_R3jLuuqfruhU0To1mllk3G_1FWEJxCQa3da7ejORRlNaN7HWN1Vh2SO7HaxyONwHEehmfMgUO_wBwX15ysx8m_iOxHCq9hf68WJJqV--1PIUKsVls3nizbIk9c6c&amp;__tn__=R%5d-R">Kausar Hussain</a> had excellent recommendations but his reputation has become tarnished.
