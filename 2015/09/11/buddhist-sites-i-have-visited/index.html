World Heritage listed, it attracts pilgrims from all over the world. Initially home to hundreds of monasteries, it was abandoned by 400 AD. Since 1978, Buddhist countries have constructed extravagant monasteries spread over a huge area requiring a bicycle to see it. There are wide roads and many reflecting ponds. </span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The Maya Devi Temple sits on the exact site of Buddha’s birth. The temple area is reached by a long causeway across a lake that appears to surround the temple like an island. It is a plain low white brick building. One walks around a platform surrounding what looks like an archaeological dig to see the exact stone Buddha was born on through bullet-proof glass.<br /> <noscript><img decoding="async" class=" nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src="https://hsj.com.np/uploads/0000/386/2020/05/05/lumbini-evening.jpeg" alt="Lumbini Tour - Nepal's Top Trekking &amp; Tour Company | Himalayan Social ..." width="619" height="348" aria-label="Lumbini Tour - Nepal's Top Trekking &amp; Tour Company | Himalayan Social ..." data-bm="6" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload  nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20619%20348%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://hsj.com.np/uploads/0000/386/2020/05/05/lumbini-evening.jpeg" alt="Lumbini Tour - Nepal's Top Trekking &amp; Tour Company | Himalayan Social ..." width="619" height="348" aria-label="Lumbini Tour - Nepal's Top Trekking &amp; Tour Company | Himalayan Social ..." data-bm="6" /></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><br /> An interesting alternative is the version of Buddha propositioned by Victor of Victor&#8217;s Sculpture Garden in Ireland. Victor was a Buddhist monk for a couple of decades and I think is one of the great unsung philosophers of our time. He states that Buddha was born in Iran and never saw India.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>INDIA</strong></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>SARNATH</strong>, the site of Buddha&#8217;s first sermon is another of the big four Buddha sites. It is 13 km north of Varanasi. After Buddhism declined in the 7th century, it was rediscovered by the English in 1835. There is a 34m stupa, Ashoka Pillar, excavated monastery ruins, a museum (with the well-preserved, 3rd-century lion capital from the Ashoka pillar which is the national emblem of India and on all their money), and a modern temple with a cutting planted in 1931 from the original bodhi tree under which Buddha attained enlightenment (obtained from Sri Lanka).</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><br /> <strong>BODHGAYA</strong>, another of the 4 great Buddha centres, is where Buddha reached enlightenment. A prince, at 29, he lived in a cave just outside Bodhgaya for 6 years without drinking water or consuming food!!! Not surprisingly, he was extremely thin and was returned to health by a woman who fed him rice milk pudding. He then went and sat under the bodhi tree, attained enlightenment and became Buddha. Like Lumbini in Nepal, most Buddhist countries have built monasteries in their national style. It is a major pilgrimage site on the tourist trail with souvenir shops and all that goes with it.<br /> <strong>Mahabodhi Temple</strong> is UNESCO World Heritage-listed where he attained enlightenment and formulated his philosophy of life. It was built in the 6th century AD atop a previous Buddhist temple built in the 3rd century BC by Ashoka. Destroyed in the 11th century and restored many times, the last restoration was in 1882. Topped by an impressive 50m carved pyramidal tower, it holds a 2m high gilded seated Buddha. Behind the temple is a huge bodhi tree raised from a cutting from the original tree that was somehow growing in Sri Lanka.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Every Buddhist country has built large monasteries here, as in Lumbini, all with their architectural styles, but these are all close together and easy to see. The ones I especially enjoyed were Tibet, Bhutan (amazing exterior and interior with all the walls carved in bas-relief and painted in bright colours), Japan (understated elegance) and Thailand (spectacular roof lines and a gold Buddha). The other great highlight was the 25m tall Great Buddha statue on a 10m pedestal that towers over everything. It is surrounded by 10 smaller statues of Buddha’s disciples. The statue is hollow and contains 20,000 bronze Buddhas.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Mountain Temple, </strong>just outside Bodhaya, has the cave where Buddha fasted.

This is the home in exile for The Black Hat sect of Buddhism. The last (16th) leader of the sect died in 1993 and has not been replaced because there are two rival candidates. The Rumtek gompa is a rambling walled complex and is unusually guarded by armed police as there have been many violent altercations by monks who dispute the accession. There is a main monastery building and a Golden Stupa holding the ashes of the last leader. The Old Rumtek Gompa is a 1.5km walk away and sits in an idyllic setting on a west-facing ridge. The interior is a riot of colour.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br /> RAVANGLA</strong> has a new giant 41m tall Buddha statue.

The town was a backwater until 1960 when the Dalai Lama claimed asylum here following the 1951 Chinese invasion of Tibet. The <strong>Tsuglagkhang Complex</strong> is the main focus of pilgrims, monks and tourists. The temple is the exiles’ equivalent of the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa. The two temples are surrounded by the gompa, where one can watch monks debate. Points of argument are sealed with a foot stomp and theatrical clap of the hands. Just inside the entry gate is the Tibet Museum, telling the story of the Chinese occupation and the subsequent Tibetan exodus. The town also has many Tibetan government and cultural buildings.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>SRI LANKA</strong></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic,</strong> Kandy, houses Sri Lanka’s most sacred Buddhist relic – a tooth of the Buddha. It was snatched from the flames of the Buddha’s funeral pyre in 483 BC and smuggled in the hair of a princess to Sri Lanka in the 4th century AD, ending up in Kandy in 1283. Stolen by the Indian army, retrieved by the Ceylonese, stolen and burnt by the Portuguese (turned out to be a fake tooth), it finally returned to Kandy and the Temple was finished in 1782. Sri Lankan Buddhists believe they must make one pilgrimage here in a lifetime to improve one&#8217;s karma and the temple is a busy place. However, one does not see the tooth. It’s kept in a gold casket shaped like a dagoba (stupa), which contains a series of six dagoba caskets of diminishing size. The stupa casket is viewed from a doorway 3m away and the queue is kept moving so one only gets a brief glimpse inside the shrine room. Behind the main shrine sits a large hall with dozens of sitting Buddhas and a series of pictures depicting the life of the tooth. Behind this whole complex is the World Buddhism Museum showing Buddhism around the world.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br /> ADAM&#8217;S PEAK</strong> (2247m) is a lofty peak that has been a focus for pilgrimage for over 1000 years. It is named after the place where Adam first set foot on earth after being cast out of heaven, or Sri Pada (Sacred Footprint, left by Buddha as he headed towards paradise). In the pilgrimage season from December to May, the 7km of cement stairs to the top are illuminated at night with refreshment stands. Most start the 2-3 hour walk around 3 am up the 5200 steps to reach the top before sunrise. You pass a World Peace Pagoda near the beginning. There is a temple at the top with a giant Buddha foot as the idol.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><br /> <strong>DAMBULLA ROYAL ROCK TEMPLES</strong> are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Carved into the face of a big cliff, the five caves contain about 150 Buddha statues dating from the first century BC to more modern times. The entire inside – walls and ceilings- are spectacularly painted with geometric designs and Buddha scenes. The colours are still vivid. Cave 1 has a 15 m-long reclining Buddha that is beautifully carved. Cave 2 is arguably the most spectacular, measuring 52m long by 23m deep with a 7m high ceiling. Besides at least 50 Buddhas (the main one is under an archway decorated with dragons and has the right hand raised in a pose conveying protection), there are two statues of the kings who had the cave built. Hindu deities are also represented. A vessel sits under a constant drip from the roof, even during droughts, and the water is used during rituals. Cave 3 is filled with Buddha statues, including a beautiful reclining Buddha. Cave 4’s central Buddha sits under a decorative arch, and his hands are in a meditative pose in which the hands are cupped. Cave 5 features a reclining Buddha and Hindu gods. Try to come when there are no crowds, especially tour groups, whose constant chatter ruins the peaceful ambiance.<noscript><img decoding="async" class=" nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src="https://www.indoasia-tours.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Dambulla-Cave-Temple.jpg" alt="Dambulla Cave Temple" width="622" height="492" aria-label="Dambulla Cave Temple" data-bm="7" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload  nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20622%20492%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://www.indoasia-tours.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Dambulla-Cave-Temple.jpg" alt="Dambulla Cave Temple" width="622" height="492" aria-label="Dambulla Cave Temple" data-bm="7" /></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>The Golden Temple</strong> is a modern, kitschy building behind the square at the bottom of the complex, completed in 2000 using Japanese donations. On top of the cube-shaped building sits a 30 m-high gold-coloured Buddha in the wheel-turning pose. The Dambulla Museum is 500m south of the above complex and showcases art from prehistoric cave paintings to 18th-century frescoes.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>SIGIRLYA</strong> is the premier site of the Cultural Triangle. Geologically, Sigirlya is a hardened magma plug of an extinct volcano that long ago eroded. Peppered with natural cave shelters, rock overhangs and numerous hand-hewn additions, the rock and surrounding area were developed during the reign of King Kasapa (477-495 AD) who built a royal palace on top.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The monastery complex was abandoned in the 14th century, and ‘rediscovered’ by the British in 1898. It was declared a World Heritage Site in 1982. The theory is that the top was always a Buddhist monastery. The 370m ascent is on marble stairways and constructed metal boardwalks scaling the sheer cliff. Halfway up is a metal stairway that leads to a sheltered gallery of fresco paintings of buxom, wasp-waisted women. Protected by a big overhang, the paintings are in remarkable condition with glowing colours. All that remains today of the palaces or monastery, depending on the theory, are foundations, a carved platform, and a 27x21m square water tank.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><noscript><img decoding="async" class="" role="button" src="https://i0.wp.com/unusualplaces.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Sigiriya1.jpg?fit=917,1024&amp;ssl=1" alt="Visiting Sigiriya rock fortress in Sri Lanka.

The great Bodhi tree is central to Anuradhapura in both a spiritual and physical sense. The huge tree grew from a seedling brought from Bodhgaya in India by the sister of Mahinda, who introduced the Buddha’s teaching to Sri Lanka. Surprisingly, the present bodhi tree in Bodhgaya was grown from a cutting of this tree. The sacred bodhi tree is the oldest historically authenticated tree in the world: it has been tended by an uninterrupted succession of guardians for over 2000 years, even during periods of Indian occupation (the oldest trees in the world, however, are the bristlecone pines of the White Mountains of eastern California, the oldest of which are documented to be 4,600 years old).<br /> There are several bodhi trees here, the oldest and holiest stands on the top platform surrounded by a golden railing. Thousands come to make offerings, especially in December and April. A temple stands on the east side and the whole complex is surrounded by an ancient stone wall.<br /> The <strong>Brazen Palace</strong> ruins are close to the Bodhi tree. All that remains of this once huge palace are 1,600, ten-foot-high, square stone columns of a building thought to be nine stories high and home to 1000 monks. First constructed 2000 years ago, it was rebuilt many times, the last in the 12th century. The columns stand behind a fence. Nearby is an abandoned monastery with a huge stone trough that could hold enough rice to feed 3000 monks.<br /> The <strong>Ruvanvelisaya Dagoba</strong>, originally built in 140 BC, and rebuilt many times, is a huge 55m high, dazzlingly white, bulbous-shaped stupa. The wall at the base has a frieze of hundreds of large elephants standing shoulder to shoulder.<br /> Just north, the <strong>Thuparama Dagoba</strong> dates from the 3rd century BC and is the oldest in SL and maybe the world. Stupas are solid, have no entrances or interiors, and exist only for their exteriors.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The rest of the sites visited are away from the Mahavihara area and scattered next to the Tissa Wewa, a large lake. From the 2nd century BC, the <strong>Mirisavatiya </strong><strong>Dagoba</strong> is big and white. <strong>Isurumuniya Vihara</strong>, also 2nd century, is a rock temple with a small museum containing a sculpture of the ‘lovers’. <strong>Vessagiriya</strong> is the remains of a cave monastery complex.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Jetavanarama Area.</strong> The <strong>Jetavanarama Dagoba</strong> was built in the 3rd century, and once stood over 100m high (then the 3rd highest monument in the world, the first two being the Egyptian Pyramids), but today is about 70m. It is covered in dark brown bricks – it has been calculated that there were enough bricks in the dagoba to make a 3m-high wall stretching from London to Edinburgh. Behind the dagoba is a monastery that housed 3,000 monks. One building has door jambs over 8m high still standing. At one time, massive doors opened to reveal a large Buddha image. On the other side of the road is a 42 m x 34 m stone wall enclosure built to imitate a log wall. The building is long gone. The museum associated with this site has a carved urinal and beautiful jewelry, carvings and pottery.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Abhayagiri Monastery Area. </strong>This is spread out over a huge forest with scattered ruins everywhere. The 75m tall <strong>Abhayagiri Dagoba</strong> was created in the 1st and 2nd centuries BC and was the centrepiece of a huge monastery for 5000 monks. Chinese traveller Faxian visited in 412 AD. It, too, is all brick and has some interesting bas-reliefs. A ruined 9th-century school for monks has the finest carved <strong>Moonstone</strong> in SL. A moonstone is a semicircular carved rock on the ground at the entrance to a building. It was decorated with carved lions, elephants, horses, and geese. The fine steps feature plump little figures. <strong>Ratnaprasada</strong> has the finest guardstones in Anuradhapura, featuring a cobra being swallowed by a dragon. The <strong>Samadhi Buddha</strong> is a 4th-century seated statue in a seated pose and is regarded as one of the finest Buddha statues in SL. <strong>Kuttam Pokuna </strong>or the twin ponds, are two swimming pool-like bathing tanks. Water entered through the mouth of a mythical multispecies beast and was filtered and drained through both tanks. There is a nice five-headed cobra carving. <strong>Abhayagiri Museum</strong> has a collection of toilets, urinals, jewelry, and religious sculptures.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Citadel Area. </strong>This newer area has few remains of a Royal Palace, plus an enormous trough filled with rice for the monks. The temple was the first Temple of the Tooth, which originally came to Sri Lanka in 313 AD.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><br /> <strong>POLONNARUWA</strong></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The ruins are divided into 5 groups. The <strong>Archaeological Museum</strong> is excellent, but I arrived at the same time as 300 pilgrims walking from Colombo to the north of Sri Lanka. In this heat and humidity, they looked beat and very sweaty. I could understand the many monks in the group but wondered about the Westerners as they trooped in single file through the museum, too tired to look at anything. Several of them were bagged out on the floor. The ruins are spread out along a very long road, spaced in a big forest.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Royal Palace Group. </strong>The Royal Palace was big, 31x13m, and 7 stories high with the top 4 stories of wood. Now, a few of the brick and rubble walls remain with little detail. The Audience Hall had a frieze of elephants, each in a different position. Two monitor lizards were fighting in a nearby mud hole.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Quadrangle Group. </strong>A Circular Relic House had an 18m diameter terrace with a central dagoba and 4 entrances flanked by fine guardstones and the best moonstones in the whole site. The Thuparama Gediga is a hollow Buddhist temple with an intact roof. The Gal Pota is a 9×1.5m, 66cm thick hunk of rock weighing 25 tons with an inscription extolling the king&#8217;s virtues. It was dragged 100km to this site. The Hatadage is a tooth relic chamber. The Satmahal Prasads consist of 7 decreasing stories shaped like a small pyramid. There are several other small buildings.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Northern Group. </strong>I was thankful for the bike as things got spread at the end of the road. One passes a few Hindu temples, all with a Shiva linga. Rankot Vihara is a 54m high dagoba, the largest in Polonnaruwa and the 4th largest on the island. Like most other dagobas, it is an earth-filled dome covered by a brick mantle.<br /> The Buddha Seema Prasada is the monastery abbot’s convocation hall. The Lankathilaka has 17m high walls with a collapsed roof and a huge standing headless Buddha. The Kiri Vihara is a medium-sized dagoba whose overgrown jungle was cleared away after 700 years of neglect. The original lime plaster was in perfect condition, and it is the best-preserved dagoba in the entire site.<br /> I saved the best for last, as the <strong>Gal Vihara</strong> is a group of beautiful Buddha statues that mark the high point of Sinhalese rock carving. There are four statues all cut from the same piece of cream-colored granite with dark grey streaking. All are in perfect condition. The standing Buddha is 7m tall and has unusually crossed arms and a sorrowful facial expression. The 14 m-long reclining Buddha has a subtle depression in the pillow under his head and a wonderful wheel symbol on the pillow end. The other two statues are seated Buddhas. One is surrounded by a background of carved temples and an arch. These are the highlights of Polonnaruwa. There are two other small groups of buildings I did not bother with.<noscript><img decoding="async" class=" nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.eadbffdcaded96f3954a61bd561635d3?rik=6lCV31L6rCZ1bA&amp;riu=http%3a%2f%2fmysrilankaholidays.com%2fgallery%2fgal-vihara-5.jpg&amp;ehk=hFP7P46xJsQ0b6C31s%2brR%2b3xAw9Whm4OWV%2f582mGuX0%3d&amp;risl=&amp;pid=ImgRaw&amp;r=0&amp;sres=1&amp;sresct=1" alt="Gal Vihara (or Viharaya) rock temple at the Ancient City of Polonnaruwa ..." width="620" height="465" aria-label="Gal Vihara (or Viharaya) rock temple at the Ancient City of Polonnaruwa ..." data-bm="6" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload  nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20620%20465%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.eadbffdcaded96f3954a61bd561635d3?rik=6lCV31L6rCZ1bA&amp;riu=http%3a%2f%2fmysrilankaholidays.com%2fgallery%2fgal-vihara-5.jpg&amp;ehk=hFP7P46xJsQ0b6C31s%2brR%2b3xAw9Whm4OWV%2f582mGuX0%3d&amp;risl=&amp;pid=ImgRaw&amp;r=0&amp;sres=1&amp;sresct=1" alt="Gal Vihara (or Viharaya) rock temple at the Ancient City of Polonnaruwa ..." width="620" height="465" aria-label="Gal Vihara (or Viharaya) rock temple at the Ancient City of Polonnaruwa ..." data-bm="6" /></span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>BHUTAN<br /> </strong><strong>Tango University of Buddhism</strong>. In 1619, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal came to Bhutan. Called the architect, he was responsible for building most of the monasteries and dzhongs (fortresses) still standing in Bhutan today. He built this monastery in 1620 as an institute for monks. It has the same function today, and monks commit 3 years, 3 months and 3 days to study. The 45-minute walk up to the monastery is through an oak forest. Buddhist sayings pepper the trail. Gorgeous langur monkeys with black faces, white heads and chests, a grey body and long prehensile tails were scrambling and fighting in the trees. On the drive here, we had passed a stream with several small &#8220;houses&#8221; perched over it. I was impressed with what appeared to be a run-of-the-river hydroelectric project. However, the only things being turned were prayer wheels. The courtyard of the Astrology Monastery had two enormous cypress trees, now rarely seen in nature. A virtual look-alike to our western red cedar, these were as big as our largest. I counted 17 dogs snoozing, preparing for their night of mayhem.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The <strong>Thimphu Zoo</strong> holds a few deer and the takin, the national animal. Several years ago, the king decreed that it was improper for a Buddhist nation to keep an animal in captivity. The animals were set free, and the zoo closed, but the takin refused to leave the area. They were soon roaming the streets of town. The present minimalist preserve was then built. The takin is unrelated to any other animal and has an unusual appearance &#8211; the head of a goat and the body of a cow.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>The National Memorial Chorten</strong> memorializes the third king, the father of modern Bhutan. Carrying the message of world peace and prosperity, it has a classical stupa shape, but with rooms inside, wall paintings and statues. Many elderly people were sitting with their prayer beads or circumambulating the stupa.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br /> BUDDHA POINT,</strong> at 167&#8242; tall, is the tallest sitting Buddha in the world. It sits high above Thimphu, giving panoramic views of the valley and city. Made of bronze and studded with semi-precious stones, Bhutan cannot cast the large pieces. They were manufactured in China and then assembled here. A temple was built in the base but the large plaza in front was still under construction in 2013.<br /> <noscript><img decoding="async" class=" nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7418/12572535534_17d4807824_b.jpg" alt="Bhutan_0039_m | Buddha Dordenma (or Buddha Point) – I believ… | Flickr" width="620" height="398" aria-label="Bhutan_0039_m | Buddha Dordenma (or Buddha Point) – I believ… | Flickr" data-bm="7" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload  nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20620%20398%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7418/12572535534_17d4807824_b.jpg" alt="Bhutan_0039_m | Buddha Dordenma (or Buddha Point) – I believ… | Flickr" width="620" height="398" aria-label="Bhutan_0039_m | Buddha Dordenma (or Buddha Point) – I believ… | Flickr" data-bm="7" /></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br /> PUNAKHA VALLEY </strong></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>The Divine Mad Man&#8217;s Temple</strong> was built in 1499 on a hillock in the center of the valley. He used humour, songs, and sometimes bizarre and shocking behaviour with deep sexual overtones to dramatize his teachings. The temple has several wooden phalluses brought from Tibet by the lama. Penises complete with testicles are painted on most commercial buildings and carved phalluses are for sale everywhere. One store is called Phallus Handicrafts. Pilgrims receive a blessing to ward off evil by being struck on the head with a ten-inch wooden phallus. It is believed that childless couples who pray here will be blessed with children, and women visiting from all over the world. This is the only temple where alcohol is seen on altars &#8211; the Divine Madman liked his booze. The temple is accessed by a lovely 20-minute walk across rice paddies. Small groups of teenage monks were practicing playing the musical instruments that are part of Buddhist rituals.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br /> THE PUNAKHA Dzong </strong>was built in 1638 by the architect at the confluence of the Mo Chhu and Po Chhu Rivers at the exact spot prophesied by the founder of Bhutanese Buddhism, Guru Rinpoche, 800 years previously. It is easily the most impressive building and dzong in Bhutan. Tall white stone walls enclose two huge rectangular towers. One showcases all of Bhutan&#8217;s art forms. Elaborate worked gold metal surrounds the many columns. Intricate paintings of the story of Buddha cover every wall, and embroidered cloth hangings adorn everything. I watched a monk do a butter sculpture. With 8 mounds of differently coloured butter, he applied it using his thumb to construct intricate flowers. This dzhong served as the capital of Bhutan until 1955 and is still the winter residence of the central monastic body, the ruling organization of the Drukpa Kagyu School of Buddhism.<br /> <noscript><img decoding="async" class=" nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LTU3XWxNWt0/X1cutDIdgtI/AAAAAAAAAJU/HvvF7NGMgAI_IryqRNYbj0MpvZ-X6R6wgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1095/1393303802_PunakhaDzong-1095x665.jpg" alt="PUNAKHA DZONG - The oldest and historic dzong of Bhutan" width="622" height="377" aria-label="PUNAKHA DZONG - The oldest and historic dzong of Bhutan" data-bm="6" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload  nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20622%20377%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LTU3XWxNWt0/X1cutDIdgtI/AAAAAAAAAJU/HvvF7NGMgAI_IryqRNYbj0MpvZ-X6R6wgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1095/1393303802_PunakhaDzong-1095x665.jpg" alt="PUNAKHA DZONG - The oldest and historic dzong of Bhutan" width="622" height="377" aria-label="PUNAKHA DZONG - The oldest and historic dzong of Bhutan" data-bm="6" /></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br /> Khamsum Yulley Namhyal Chorten</strong> or &#8220;Queens Chorten&#8221;. It took 9 years to build and was finished in 2004 by the mother of the present king. Sitting high above the valley, there are commanding views in all directions. The temple is considered one of the finest examples of the use of traditional Bhutanese architectural style in modern times. The inside has 4 levels adorned in the best architectural style. It is impossible to describe the wood carving and fantastically painted interiors. Each has statues of all the important people in Bhutan’s Buddhist culture &#8211; Guru Rinpoche, the Architect and the pantheon of Buddhist gods. Every altar has bowls of holy water filled before sunrise and emptied after sunset daily. Lotus blossoms float in the water. Butter lanterns give a musky scent to the air. Donations of food and money compete with butter sculptures and candle-driven prayer wheels. Ancient elephant tusks flank the altar. On the roof, we enjoyed the stupendous views.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Talo</strong>, the hometown of the present queen, has an 8-foot wide road paved since her marriage. We visited an ancient monastery with all the usual over-the-top interiors. Here, the 400-year-old paintings were directly on the concrete but in good condition. Four young monks were playing darts, and they let me join them. It took several attempts to get my range (50m is a long throw), but I still never got very close. On the way down, we visited a nunnery, one of three in the country. Small groups of tonsured women sat on the grass practicing their prayers and chants. They were a much more serious group than any male monks. The monastery was as fantastic as all the others. An imposing statue of Chenrizig, the 11-headed, thousand-armed god of compassion, was the main deity. Anybody who says Buddhism is a philosophy, not a religion, has not seen this religion in action.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br /> Tiger&#8217;s NEST</strong> is the iconic and most famous Bhutan tourist site. It has been listed as one of the ten holiest places in the world. It is called the Tiger&#8217;s Nest as Guru Rimpoche is said to have flown to the site on the back of a tigress, and the monastery was built in 1692. Fire damaged the monasteries in 1951 and 1998, after which a major reconstruction was undertaken. After a 30-minute drive north of Paro, we joined the throngs starting the hike. Horses are available for rent. Supposedly a 900m elevation gain, it is probably more like 600m. It took me 1 1/2 hours at my slow, steady pace, and I lost count after passing the 100th person. This was a physical test for most. Prayer flags are everywhere in Bhutan, but the numbers here were over the top. Some spanned impossible distances. The high point of the trail is reached at a viewpoint, where both the valley below and the monastery perched on a ledge on a vertical granite wall. There are at least 10 other monasteries dotted across the cliff above the one at Tiger&#8217;s Nest. The location is spectacular. One descends many steps built on the cliff to the base of a stunning waterfall, and then a tiring ascent to the monastery. I was frisked for the first time in Bhutan. The monastery is a series of seven or so small temples, each with its gods and statues. I had beaten all the people and was alone in most of them. I wandered through them for over 50 minutes and then the crowds arrived.</span><a class="YsLeY" tabindex="0" role="link" href="https://tobinka.com/bhutan-tigers-nest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ved="0CBQQjRxqFwoTCOjrrY3czo0DFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE" aria-label="Visit tobinka"><noscript><img decoding="async" class="sFlh5c FyHeAf iPVvYb" src="https://tobinka.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/8_bhutan_dsc_10483_country-image.jpg" alt="The best of Bhutan: Tiger's Nest Monastery and Punakha Dzong | tobinka" width="623" height="414" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload sFlh5c FyHeAf iPVvYb" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20623%20414%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://tobinka.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/8_bhutan_dsc_10483_country-image.jpg" alt="The best of Bhutan: Tiger's Nest Monastery and Punakha Dzong | tobinka" width="623" height="414" /></a></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Jowo Temple of Kyichu</strong> is the oldest existing temple in Bhutan, built in the 7th century. Besides ancient relics, the painted walls were obscured by the soot of butter lamps. Hundreds of prayer wheels fill niches in the exterior walls.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br /> Chele La Pass</strong> (at 3980m, the highest road pass in Bhutan) to the Haa Valley (2700m). The narrow but good road switchbacked up through a wonderful forest of large mature spruce, fir and larch to the pass. We had good views of the Himalayas including the highest mountain in Bhutan. There are 2 temples, the Black and the White Monasteries, both very old.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>MYANMAR</strong></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The Myanmar style of Buddhism is unique. Large stone lions flank the large stairways leading up to a raised platform on which the gold stupa sits. The stairways are usually lined with vendors. Temples line the outer walls of the platform, usually with many Buddha images. Altars are simple with flowers, holy water and sometimes fruit. Flashing neon lights are behind Buddha’s head. There is no pantheon of gods – only one, Buddha. The interiors of the temples are simple, often painted gold. Dioramas with statues of monks or disciples are frequent. The roof lines, however, are ornate with multiple tiers and gold crests. Most stupas have corners for the eight days of the week. The stupas are always painted gold and have ornate metal cones on top. There are no entrances into the stupa proper – they are solid. People walk clockwise or counterclockwise, it doesn’t seem to matter. There are no prayer wheels or prayer flags. Just as everywhere else, people pray with prayer beads of 108 beads and keep up a droning chant.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Male monks wear maroon, and female nuns wear pink. They enter the monastery as little children, often from families with too many children to support. Up at five, they make the rounds of the village or city with their large bowls, begging for food from the members of the town. They do not eat after noon. They seem very worldly – have smartphones, ride in taxis and shop in stores. The internet cafe I used in Mandalay always had at least 10 teenage monks using Skype, Gmail, and playing video games. They receive a normal education and sometimes college degrees and Ph.D.s. Foreign teachers said they were normal, mischievous boys, but also keen students.<br /> <strong><br /> SULE PAYA</strong> is a 2,000-year-old Buddhist temple occupying the largest traffic circle in Yangon – the ‘gold’ stupa is a landmark. The Myanmar style of Buddhist architecture (like most countries) is unique, with plain interiors and a heavy emphasis on gilding. All the Buddha’s heads are surrounded by flashing neon.<noscript><img decoding="async" class=" nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src="https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/0b/2c/f0/10.jpg" alt="Sule Pagoda (Sule Paya), Yangon | Tickets &amp; Tours - 2024" width="617" height="401" aria-label="Sule Pagoda (Sule Paya), Yangon | Tickets &amp; Tours - 2024" data-bm="7" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload  nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20617%20401%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/0b/2c/f0/10.jpg" alt="Sule Pagoda (Sule Paya), Yangon | Tickets &amp; Tours - 2024" width="617" height="401" aria-label="Sule Pagoda (Sule Paya), Yangon | Tickets &amp; Tours - 2024" data-bm="7" /></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br /> SHWEDAGON PAYA</strong> is Yangon’s defining image, and a symbol of Burmese identity for 2,500 years. The compound with its main zedi (stupa) and 82 other buildings is astounding any time of the day, but evening and sunrise, when the light hits the gilding are the best times to visit.<br /> Paya means ‘Holy one” or religious monument. Shwedagon is said to be built on a hill where Buddha relics have been enshrined, including eight hairs of Buddha. The zedi is 98m tall and over the years has accumulated 53 metric tons of gold leaf. The top of the spire is encrusted with over 5000 diamonds and 2000 other stones.<br /> We went in the evening by taxi for 2000 kyat. Though there are elevators, I would encourage you to walk up one of the huge, graceful stairways (one for each direction). The stupa is surrounded by eight ‘corners’, one for each day of the week plus one extra. Using the day of the week they were born, one pours cups of holy water over a Buddha image, one for each year of their age plus one extra. One could spend 3 hours exploring all the temples, large bells, several gigantic bodhi trees, and Jade Buddha, or simply sitting around soaking in the ambiance.<noscript><img decoding="async" class=" nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src="https://www.tripsavvy.com/thmb/7S1z1otmxDdPPtQEzLyaqGFQAE0=/4938x3292/filters:fill(auto,1)/shwedagon-pagoda-yangon-5a0e73e44e4f7d0036a76931.jpg" alt="Shwedagon Pagoda: Planning Your Trip" width="622" height="415" aria-label="Shwedagon Pagoda: Planning Your Trip" data-bm="13" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload  nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20622%20415%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://www.tripsavvy.com/thmb/7S1z1otmxDdPPtQEzLyaqGFQAE0=/4938x3292/filters:fill(auto,1)/shwedagon-pagoda-yangon-5a0e73e44e4f7d0036a76931.jpg" alt="Shwedagon Pagoda: Planning Your Trip" width="622" height="415" aria-label="Shwedagon Pagoda: Planning Your Trip" data-bm="13" /></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br /> Manhangar Pagoda, </strong>Inle was originally built in 1313. Five sacred mounds of accumulated gold leaf covering ancient Buddha images are worshipped.

We took a long, narrow river trip at the end of the lake. Walking along a river with a big weir, you end up climbing up a big covered stair to the top with a large temple, surrounded, at last count, by 1,054 stupas. The original stupa, built in 270 BC, is encased in the present pagoda. The oldest stupas are crumbling brick, but many are modern and all sizes.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br /> MANDALAY</strong></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Mahamuni Paya</strong> is a temple with a 4 m-tall Buddha image seized from Rakhine State in 1784. Cast as early as the first century, its story of transportation by boat and land is told by wonderful paintings in one of the rooms. It is so venerated that it is washed and its teeth brushed every morning at 4 am by a team of monks (many tourists attend). It is now covered by 15cm of gold leaf, applied by hundreds every day. The upper part of the statue can’t be reached to apply gold but the arms have disappeared under it. Women are not allowed on the platform. In the NW corner of the compound is a room holding several large bronze statues originally from Angkor Wat in Cambodia, taken as booty from a war with Thailand, lost and then recaptured again in 1599. One is a three-headed elephant, there are two 8-foot-tall warriors and two lions. Legend has it that touching parts of the statues that you may be having health problems with will cure you. As a result, the patina is well-worn, and holes have formed in the noses and other parts.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Sagaing</strong> is the ancient capital of the Sagaing Dynasty (1315-1364). There are 500 stupas and monasteries covering the hilltops above the river. After a 30-minute climb, I reached the top of Sagaing Hill and the monastery with outstanding views of Mandalay, the river and all the surroundings. Gold stupas poke above the trees everywhere.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Mingun</strong> is home to a trio of unique pagodas. We reached it north of Sagaing in a half an hour. The <em>Mingun Paya</em>is are the remains of a planned 150m tall stupa, a candidate for the world’s largest pile of bricks (thought to be a billion as the huge structure is entirely brick with no earth fill). Before the earthquake on 11/11/2011, it was possible to climb to the top. The <em>Mingun Bell</em> holds the record for the world’s largest uncracked bell (one-third the size of a bell in Moscow and 14x the size of the bell in St Paul’s Cathedral). Casted in 1865, it weighs 90 tons and is 16.3 feet wide at the bottom and 12 feet high. 200m north is the white, wavy terraced <em>Hsinbyume Paya</em>. The remnants of two huge lions are across the street from the Paya. The heads are gone and the backs collapsed but the rear ends with ornate plaster covering the brick remain.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Inwa</strong>, founded in 1354, was the historical capital for four centuries. Most visitors here rent a horse and cart to make the three-hour tour of all the ruins. Several small stupas dot the roadsides; one has an old Buddha image. The finest site is an enormous 1834 teak monastery.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong> Three Temples</strong>. Rarely seen by tourists, the site consists of three similar 40-meter square solid brick structures built in the 13th century, each with four arched entrances leading to a room with large sitting Buddha images. The images are unusual in that they have closed eyes and downcast heads. Some faint remnants of murals remain and the images have original paint. The most northerly two temples are in significant disrepair, but the other has been restored. Passageways connect the four rooms and stairways lead to the roof overgrown with trees. This is a good side trip on the way to the Mandalay airport.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br /> BHAMO </strong>has the usual stupa and the Thousand Monks, a single-file line of monk statues, each slightly shorter and with different features than the one before, following a large Buddha image.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br /> BAGAN</strong> The Bagan Archaeological Zone stretches for 41 sq. km. Despite centuries of looting, neglect, erosion, earthquakes and dodgy restoration, the temple-studded plain remains impressive. In a 230-year building frenzy ending in 1287 and the Mongol invasions, Bagan’s kings commissioned over 4000 Buddhist temples. Many restoration projects have resulted in a compromised archaeological site that can barely be described as ruined. It has attained Unesco World Heritage status since my visit, It remains a wonder. The best temples give a sense of what the place was like at its zenith, while others conceal colourful murals and hidden stairways that lead to exterior platforms and jaw-dropping views across the plain.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">We rented bicycles and visited many small temples lining the river and the walled city of Old Bagan. On the North Plain, Ananda Pahto, built in 1105, is probably Bagan’s top draw. Here and in many other temples, the murals retain their bright colours. Shwesandaw Paya is a steep white pyramid with 360-degree views of all the temples and was packed for sunset. Several temples have interior interconnecting passageways and steep, narrow stairways taking you onto the roofs. There are so many similar structures that it gets a little redundant.<noscript><img decoding="async" class=" nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src="https://experitour.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/myanmar_2-1199x800-1-1199x800.jpg" alt="Tour Des Temples De Bagan – Demain De Bagan, Myanmar | experitour.com" width="618" height="413" aria-label="Tour Des Temples De Bagan – Demain De Bagan, Myanmar | experitour.com" data-bm="6" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload  nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20618%20413%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://experitour.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/myanmar_2-1199x800-1-1199x800.jpg" alt="Tour Des Temples De Bagan – Demain De Bagan, Myanmar | experitour.com" width="618" height="413" aria-label="Tour Des Temples De Bagan – Demain De Bagan, Myanmar | experitour.com" data-bm="6" /></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br /> GOLDEN ROCK</strong>. This giant, gold-leaf-covered boulder appears to be hanging precariously, but the small metal stupa on top (supposedly contains a Buddha hair donated by a hermit in the 11th century. The hair was salvaged from the bottom of the sea and brought here by boat!!! and lots of gold leaf applied to the back are tipping the balance to ensure it stays where it is, despite several earthquakes.

The soles of each foot are decorated with 108 marks representing the three worlds – 59 of the inanimate world, 21 of the animate world and 28 of the conditional world.

Sukhothai emerged as the Khmer empire was crumbling in the 13th century, and subsequently ruled over parts of the empire’s western frontier for 150 years. The kingdom took artistic inspiration from its former overseers, building a city of temples with gravity-warped basalt columns, prangs, stupas, serene Buddha figures and weed-sprouting towers. Although Ayuthaya has a more interesting historical narrative, Sukhothai’s ancient city is better preserved and architecturally more engaging.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The central area comprises most of the ancient kingdom and is surrounded by three concentric ramparts and two moats, bridged by four gateways – important celestial geometry. Inside the old walls are the remains of 21 well-preserved historical buildings. Outside in the northern zone is an impressive 15m-high brick and stucco seated Buddha with elegant, tapered fingers. In the western zone are many relatively featureless ruins but a 12.5m high standing Buddha on the crest of a hill with good views.

The walls inside and out are covered with bas-reliefs and carvings. Nearly 2000 apsara or female divinity carvings and Hindu mythology scenes adorn the interior walls. But it is the exterior of the lower level that displays the most extraordinary bas-reliefs, depicting scenes and characters from Hindu mythology and the historical wars of Suryavaman II who built the temple to honour the Hindu god Vishnu: the mythological battle of Kuru on the west wall, the historical march of the army of Surryavaman II against the Cham (Vietnamese), scenes from heaven and hell on the south wall, and then the classic ‘Churning of the Ocean Milk’ on the east wall.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The inside of the temple has five towers rising 31m above the third level, the central one contains four Buddha images, each facing a cardinal direction. it is open and climbed by one steep stairway.

Some have called this the world’s biggest jigsaw puzzle. Before the civil war, the Baphuon was painstakingly taken apart piece by piece by a team of archaeologists, but their meticulous records were destroyed during the Khmer Rouge madness. After years of excruciating research, it has been restored by finding all the blocks spread throughout the forest. One of the biggest challenges was that the retaining wall on the western side was fashioned in the 15th century into a reclining Buddha 60m in length.<br /> <strong>Preah Khan</strong> or ‘Sacred Sword’, built in 1191, is one of the larger complexes and was built by Jayavarman VII. It housed 1000 teachers and may have been a Buddhist university. Surrounded by a rectangular 700x800m wall and a moat, the temple is a cruciform maze of vaulted corridors, fine carvings and lichen-clad stonework. The southern corridor is an atmospheric jumble of vines and stones. The center of the cross contains a Buddha image, but all the corridors contain Shiva linga and defaced Buddha images done during the Hindu resurgence.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Neak Poan</strong>, ‘coiled serpent from the encoiled nagas that encircle the temple’, another of Jayavarman VII’s constructions, is a small temple located on an artificial, 350m square island in the middle of the last baray built in Angkor (3500x900m). Reached via a long bridge over water, almost completely overgrown with trees, the central temple sits at the axis of a lotus pattern of eight pools. Water once flowed into the pools by 4 ornamental spouts in the form of an elephant’s head, a horse’s head, a lion’s head and a human head.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>PHNOM PENH</strong></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Silver Pagoda</strong> in the Royal Palace is the real attraction in the palace, <strong> </strong>housing a treasure trove of Buddha images.

Shinto taboos concerning death stipulated that the capital be moved with the passing of each emperor, but this practice died out when Buddhism was introduced and the country came under imperial control in the 7th century. It was the capital for only 75 years from 710-785 when a priest seduced the empress, and it was moved to Kyoto out of the reach of the powerful clergy. Nara was spared the periodic bouts of destruction wreaked upon Kyoto, and many magnificent sites survived, with eight of them Unesco World Heritage Sites. All the sites can be seen in an easy day.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Most of Nara’s important sites are in a huge park that occupies the east half of the city. The park is home to thousands of deer, all habituated and tame. The crowds feed them regularly and then wonder why the deer get aggressive. All the deer have had their antlers removed. In pre-Buddhist times, the deer were considered messengers of the gods and today enjoy the status of National Treasures.<br /> <noscript><img decoding="async" class=" nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src="https://a.cdn-hotels.com/gdcs/production27/d1067/4aab9f56-ef95-42f4-b14c-d572774e24af.jpg" alt="13 Best Things to Do in Nara - What is Nara Most Famous For? - Go Guides" width="621" height="413" aria-label="13 Best Things to Do in Nara - What is Nara Most Famous For? - Go Guides" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload  nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20621%20413%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://a.cdn-hotels.com/gdcs/production27/d1067/4aab9f56-ef95-42f4-b14c-d572774e24af.jpg" alt="13 Best Things to Do in Nara - What is Nara Most Famous For? - Go Guides" width="621" height="413" aria-label="13 Best Things to Do in Nara - What is Nara Most Famous For? - Go Guides" /></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br /> Yoshiki-en</strong> is a free garden just outside the gates.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Isui-en. </strong>Next door is another garden dating from the late 1800s.

At 14.6m high, it contains 437 tons of bronze and 130kg of gold and is one of the world’s largest bronze Buddhas. It was cast in 746 in eight castings for three years. Its hands send the message ‘fear not’ and ‘welcome’. It was originally covered in gold leaf and must have had an enormous impact on its Japanese visitors in the eighth century. It is believed that it was made as a charm against smallpox, which ravaged Japan in the preceding years. Over the centuries, the statue took quite a beating, losing its head a few times in earthquakes.<br /> <noscript><img decoding="async" class=" nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src="https://www.kanpai-japan.com/sites/default/files/uploads/2015/11/todaiji-nara-26.jpg" alt="Todai-ji - Nara’s Great Buddha Temple" width="617" height="412" aria-label="Todai-ji - Nara’s Great Buddha Temple" data-bm="6" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload  nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20617%20412%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://www.kanpai-japan.com/sites/default/files/uploads/2015/11/todaiji-nara-26.jpg" alt="Todai-ji - Nara’s Great Buddha Temple" width="617" height="412" aria-label="Todai-ji - Nara’s Great Buddha Temple" data-bm="6" /></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The statue is housed in an equally huge building, the <strong>Daibutsu-den Hall</strong>, the world’s largest wooden building at 48.74m high, 57m long, and has 112,589 roof tiles. Unbelievably, the present structure, rebuilt twice (last in 1709), is a mere two-thirds of the size of the original. Todai-ji was built by order of the Emperor during the Nara Period (710-785) and the complex was finally completed in 798 after the capital had been moved from Nara to Kyoto. Legend has it that two million labourers worked on the temple and its construction brought the country to the brink of bankruptcy. Also in the hall are four other great figures.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br /> HORYU-JI </strong>is an amazing UNESCO Site. Founded in 607 by Prince Shotoku, the patron saint of Japanese Buddhism, Horyu-ji is renowned as not only being the oldest temple in Japan but also for several of its great wooden temple buildings that have survived earthquakes and fires to become the oldest wooden buildings in the world. Many of the statues in the temples date from the 7th century. A treasure hall contains a great display of equally old stuff that is much more interesting than the average museum.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br /> NIKKO</strong></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Tosho-gu</strong> was the work of 15,000 artisans from across Japan who took two years to build it. Inside the shrine gate are three sacred storehouses, a sacred stable (engraved with the three famous monkeys of “hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil” fame, the three principles of Tendai Buddhism), a hall, a hall of worship, a famous wood carved sleeping cat (hard to know what they get excited about with this one), the three Buddha hall and finally the Tomb of Ieyasu up a big flight of stairs.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Rinno-ji</strong> is a shrine constructed of 360 zelkova trees and has three 8m gilded Buddhas.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br /> TOKYO</strong></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Senso-ji</strong> is Tokyo’s most visited Shinto shrine and crowds and tours packed the area.

With 9000 rooms and 35 Buddhist worship areas, it is also the world’s largest palace complex. It was named ‘Forbidden’ as it was off-limits for 500 years and uninvited guests were executed. It was the reclusive home to both the Ming and Qing dynasties until overthrown in 1924.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Summer Palace.</strong> Climb <strong>Longevity Hill</strong> to the <strong>Buddhist Fragrance Pavilion</strong> and the <strong>Buddhist Temple of the Sea of Wisdom</strong> for great views down to Kunming Lake through the smog-induced haze.

This exceptional Tibetan Buddhist temple, the most important one outside of Tibet, is the one temple to visit in Beijing. After passing through a lovely garden, multiple halls culminate in the Wantu Pavilion with its magnificent 18m-high statue of Maitreya Buddha sculpted from a single piece of white sandalwood. All the halls have riveting roofs, frescoes, tapestries, and eye-popping carpentry. Small side halls have great displays of Buddhist treasures. Today it is an active place of worship attracting pilgrims from afar.</span></p><p><noscript><img decoding="async" class=" nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src="https://livingnomads.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/08/Lama-Temple-beijing3.jpeg" alt="Lama-tempel-Beijing | Expedia.nl" width="620" height="310" aria-label="Lama-tempel-Beijing | Expedia.nl" data-bm="6" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload  nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20620%20310%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://livingnomads.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/08/Lama-Temple-beijing3.jpeg" alt="Lama-tempel-Beijing | Expedia.nl" width="620" height="310" aria-label="Lama-tempel-Beijing | Expedia.nl" data-bm="6" /><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br /> DATONG Shanxi</strong></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Huayan Temple</strong> is an active Buddhist temple (907-1125) and has some of the largest Buddhist halls in China.

There are 51,000 ancient statues, 254 carved niches, and 45 caves, of which #9, 10 and 40-45 were closed. Amazingly, they still retain their gorgeous pigment. Some are fronted with wooden temples, some contain intricately carved wooden pagodas, and others have central carved stone pagodas. Frescos of Buddhist scenes, animals, birds and angels, some still brightly painted, are abundant. Eight caves contain enormous Buddha statues, the largest is seated and 17 m high. Some of the caves are three levels high, and the big Buddhas stare out of windows cut into the rock. Some of the carvings are exquisite, including many 1000 Buddha walls and a 30-scene depiction of Buddha’s life. Unfortunately, there is some graffiti, weathering and removal of heads. There are good English captions outside each cave.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The entire complex has been spiffed out in grand style – a huge entrance gate, a huge entrance pavilion with shops and restaurants, an entrance walkway with 28 large stone columns sitting on elephants, a big temple complex with 3 halls on pilings in the middle of a lake, long stone walkways, and stone fences.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Yungang Caves receive few foreign visitors but are well worth it.

Many of the effigies have been vandalized or decapitated with the heads now residing in museums in America and Japan. The White Horse Temple is the first Buddhist temple in China dating from the 1st century AD.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br /> BIG GOOSE PAGODA</strong>, Xi’an I went to a light/fountain show outside the pagoda one night – it was nothing special. The pagoda is Xi’an’s most famous landmark. It was completed in 652 to house Buddhist sutras brought from India (a translation that took 19 years is still in use today).</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Wenshu Temple</strong>, Chengdu a Tang dynasty monastery, to hear the monks chant at 18:00.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br /> LESHAN</strong></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Grand Buddha at Leshan</strong>. This is the largest Buddha statue in the world. The 1200-year-old statue is carved into a cliff face overlooking the confluence of the Dadu and Min Rivers. And at 71m, he is big. His ears stretch for 7m, his shoulders span 28m, and each of his big toes is 8.5m long. A Buddhist monk conceived the project in AD 713 and took 90 years to complete. Inside the body, hidden from view, is a water drainage system to prevent weathering. He is showing his age, and soil erosion is an ongoing problem. To appreciate his magnitude, get an up-close look at his head, then descend the steep, winding stairway for the Lilliputian view. Avoid weekends and holidays, as crowds on the stairway bring the pace to a standstill. I was first at the ticket booth and first at the Grand Buddha. Other tourists had complained of the enormous queues (up to an hour and a half) at the Buddha, but I had it all to myself (in fact I didn’t see another tourist all day). He is big, and covered with ferns and plant growth. After the climb to the top from the ticket booth, one descends on a very steep walkway cut into the cliff with ancient carvings on one side and the Buddha on the other. A funny sign about not throwing garbage down into the river said “No Parabolics” referring to the arc of something being thrown.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The exit is on the other side and is the beginning of the up-and-down Cliff Road to see all the other sites, including a fishing village.<br /> <noscript><img decoding="async" class="" role="button" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.1ee4ccbb156d7e33c2262998e92e0513?rik=APjzIJD%2fg49BfQ&amp;riu=http%3a%2f%2fphotorator.com%2fphotos%2fimages%2fleshan-giant-buddha-mount-emei-china--21081.jpg&amp;ehk=6O3F88tVvpxuLc8s3VlwHsRAQPIR6%2foVLYlgiwYCOF8%3d&amp;risl=&amp;pid=ImgRaw&amp;r=0" alt="Leshan Giant Buddha Mount Emei China - Photorator" width="469" height="626" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload " role="button" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20469%20626%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.1ee4ccbb156d7e33c2262998e92e0513?rik=APjzIJD%2fg49BfQ&amp;riu=http%3a%2f%2fphotorator.com%2fphotos%2fimages%2fleshan-giant-buddha-mount-emei-china--21081.jpg&amp;ehk=6O3F88tVvpxuLc8s3VlwHsRAQPIR6%2foVLYlgiwYCOF8%3d&amp;risl=&amp;pid=ImgRaw&amp;r=0" alt="Leshan Giant Buddha Mount Emei China - Photorator" width="469" height="626" /></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Mahaoya Tombs. </strong>500 monks were buried here in the honeycomb caves; there is a nice small museum with pottery animals, kitchenware, lesser functionaries, and massive, intricately carved stone coffins.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Wuyou Temple.</strong> After crossing a lovely domed bridge to an island, it is another stiff climb. It was also built in the Tang dynasty. A monk got pissed off when I hit the large wood tortoise gong more than once (I can’t resist these and the great brass bowl ‘bells’ with their perfect tone). Contrary to Buddhist monks in SE Asia where many young men go to acquire an education and who all speak English, these monks were a fairly ignorant lot.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Luohan Hall.</strong> Beside the temple, this contains 500 completely different life-sized, terracotta celestial beings all with different postures and facial expressions. The hall also contains a fantastic 1000-armed statue of Guanyin, the Chinese Goddess of Mercy (Avalokiteshvara in Sanskrit).</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Oriental Buddhist Theme Park</strong>  On this, the opposite side of the mountain from the Buddha, tombs and temples, recently constructed housing 3000 Buddha statues, including a 170 m–long reclining Buddha, the world’s largest. I didn’t go. This is not a day for the unfit, as there are a lot of stairs.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br /> DAZU BUDDHIST ROCK CARVINGS</strong></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Don’t miss these. I have many things Buddha, but Dazu is one of the best. There are many sites around Dazu, but only two are commonly visited, and I did not go to the other, North Hill.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Baodingshan Rock Carvings </strong>(Treasured Summit Hill). Carved from 1174-1252, thousands of figures were carved into a U-shaped cliff. Unesco World Heritage-listed, they are the most recent of China’s best sites, but the artwork here is arguably the best. There are 14 big niches under overhangs and two caves with thousands (supposedly 50,000) figures depicting the entire Buddha story. Many still have original paint, mostly blues, reds and gold.<br /> The highlights are esoteric Buddhism, a depiction of Hell like in many Catholic churches (think torture, boiling cauldrons, and gruesome figures), the Buddhist happy world, parental love, the peacock king, nine dragons, water from a pond above channelled into a dragon’s mouth bathing a baby Buddha, Buddha entering nirvana (a 31m lying Buddha with only the upper torso carved), and the most amazing one of all is a gold Avlokiteshvara (or Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy) with 1007 hands fanning out from her, entwined and reaching for the skies. Each hand has an eye, the symbol of wisdom. (This is fronted by a wood temple under renovation for the last 4 years so I had to show a lot of effort to see most of it).<br /> Following this are the three Huajin saints (one holds a 500kg pagoda in his hands – the sculpture cleverly uses draped clothing to support the arms), the Buddhist Wheel of Life, buffalos (10 water buffalos show the gradual process of taming mental activities), and finally the Cave of Enlightenment. It is quite a show.<br /> <noscript><img decoding="async" class=" nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src="https://www.chinadiscovery.com/assets/images/travel-guide/chongqing/dazu/baodingshan.jpg" alt="Dazu Rock Carvings - Chongqing Dazu Caves" width="622" height="414" aria-label="Dazu Rock Carvings - Chongqing Dazu Caves" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload  nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20622%20414%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://www.chinadiscovery.com/assets/images/travel-guide/chongqing/dazu/baodingshan.jpg" alt="Dazu Rock Carvings - Chongqing Dazu Caves" width="622" height="414" aria-label="Dazu Rock Carvings - Chongqing Dazu Caves" /></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">After cresting the hill, there is a great temple. When I arrived, 4 monks were chanting with at least 80 old women doing salutations. Outside were two groups of old ladies knitting and making cloth shoes. They were fun to josh with.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br /> Arhat Temple,</strong> Chongqing (a Buddhist temple now sandwiched between skyscrapers)</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Fengdu</strong>. On the Three Gorges Dam Cruise, after passing the drowned town of Fuling, we arrived at Fengdu, 170 km from Chongqing. Nicknamed the City of Ghosts, it was inundated in 2009 and its residents moved across the river.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Ming Shan,</strong> with its ghost-focused temples. We climbed to the top of 400 steps through many Tao/Buddhist temples, the most recent reconstructions since the 2008 earthquake. They are all about heaven and hell, a recurring theme in most religions. We passed over the middle of three bridges to see if we passed the test. The most amazing was at the very top with gruesome depictions of torture and evil.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br /> SHIBAUZHAI PAGODA </strong>This is a 12-story, red, wooden pagoda, 56m high, built and leaning against a big chunk of rock. The bottom nine stories were originally built during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) and the top three stories above the height of rock were added in 1956. The stairs inside the pagoda pass by steles and statues of deities and generals. Architecturally unique, it has round windows and is built without nails. The duck well proved that the well was connected with the river after a duck was put down the well and appeared in the river. The rice flowing well provided free rice until a greedy monk enlarged the hole, stopping the flow of rice forever,r proving that greed doesn’t pay. The views from the temple on top are panoramic. Since the dam was built, the climb is now 175m less than originally, and the rock and pagoda are now an island reached by a swaying suspension bridge called the ‘drunken bridge’.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br /> LUSHAN </strong>One of the great early monastic centers of Chinese civilization, the dramatic fog-enshrouded cliffs of Lushan have attracted monastics and thinkers for 1500 years. The monk Hui Yuan, one of the first Chinese teachers to promote meditation, founded Pure Land Buddhism here in the 4th century. Tao Yuanming, a contemporary, was China’s first landscape poet.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br /> TIAN TAN BUDDHA STATUE</strong>, Hong Kong. At 26m, this is the world’s tallest seated Buddha (this is what they say, but Buddha Point in Bhutan is significantly larger at 50m). Take the metro to Tung Chung and then the cable car. This must be the longest cable car in the world as it makes two turns and goes over a mountain and is relatively expensive at HK$180. It was a 2-hour wait to get onto the cable car as I went in the early afternoon, so I went early to beat the crowds. Walk through a lot of souvenir shops to get to the base of the Buddha, then a long stair to the statue. If I had not collected all things Buddha, this may have not been worth it. Consider taking the tram up and then walking down (2-3 hours).<noscript><img decoding="async" class="nofocus alignleft" tabindex="0" role="button" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/22/95/5b/22955b17584bad04caf7729507174a5d.jpg" alt="Tian Tan Buddha The statue is named Tian Tan Buddha because its base is ..." width="620" height="413" aria-label="Tian Tan Buddha The statue is named Tian Tan Buddha because its base is ..." data-bm="12" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload nofocus alignleft" tabindex="0" role="button" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20620%20413%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/22/95/5b/22955b17584bad04caf7729507174a5d.jpg" alt="Tian Tan Buddha The statue is named Tian Tan Buddha because its base is ..." width="620" height="413" aria-label="Tian Tan Buddha The statue is named Tian Tan Buddha because its base is ..." data-bm="12" /></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><br /> <strong>MAIJI SI</strong><strong>.</strong> 35 miles SE of Tianshui is “Haystack Mountain” whose cliffs are riddled with niches and statues carved from AD 389-581. On my quest to see everything Buddha in the world, I am glad I did not miss this one. The 221 caves and 1000 statues on the vertical cliff face are accessed by catwalks and stairways cross-crossing the cliff. Most of the statues are made of clay with elaborate clothing and detailed painting. Six large statues, the biggest at 15.7m, adorn the cliff outside of the caves. How all this was carved remains a mystery – it is thought that they worked on piles of wood blocks. These caves were heavily defaced by the Red Guards in the Cultural Revolution.<br /> <noscript><img decoding="async" class=" nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d5/b5/44/d5b5440ecf4c123bc8ecbc892702720e.jpg" alt="thegasolinestation: “The Maijishan Grottoes The Maijishan Grottoes in ..." width="621" height="465" aria-label="thegasolinestation: “The Maijishan Grottoes The Maijishan Grottoes in ..." /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload  nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20621%20465%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d5/b5/44/d5b5440ecf4c123bc8ecbc892702720e.jpg" alt="thegasolinestation: “The Maijishan Grottoes The Maijishan Grottoes in ..." width="621" height="465" aria-label="thegasolinestation: “The Maijishan Grottoes The Maijishan Grottoes in ..." /></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br /> BING LING SI</strong>, Liujiaxia. Because of its inaccessibility, this was one of the few Buddhist grottos to have survived the 20th century unscathed. Over 1600 years, workers dangled from ropes to carve 183 niches and sculptures in the sandstone of the steep canyon walls. The stars of the site are the 27m high, seated statue of Maitreya, the future Buddha, and a 9m reclining Buddha. But much of the rest of the carving is exquisite and a lot of the paint is still bright. Just below the grottos, the canyon ends at the reservoir on the Yellow River, hemmed in by a ring of dramatic rock pinnacles.<noscript><img decoding="async" class=" nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.a34019c1b5cc52386a59c6faefff8d03?rik=sFXYqpu8YIA3Rw&amp;riu=http%3a%2f%2fsilkroadshow.cn%2frelicsimgs%2f2020%2f11%2f29%2f%e7%82%b3%e7%81%b5%e5%af%ba.jpg&amp;ehk=tkDzKKPDjToz96E47yoAw8QXXNL6eN0M9vMmzhokBAQ%3d&amp;risl=&amp;pid=ImgRaw&amp;r=0" alt="炳灵寺石窟 - 国家艺术基金资助项目-丝绸之路中国段世界文化遗产数字展示与交流平台" width="621" height="405" aria-label="炳灵寺石窟 - 国家艺术基金资助项目-丝绸之路中国段世界文化遗产数字展示与交流平台" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload  nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20621%20405%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.a34019c1b5cc52386a59c6faefff8d03?rik=sFXYqpu8YIA3Rw&amp;riu=http%3a%2f%2fsilkroadshow.cn%2frelicsimgs%2f2020%2f11%2f29%2f%e7%82%b3%e7%81%b5%e5%af%ba.jpg&amp;ehk=tkDzKKPDjToz96E47yoAw8QXXNL6eN0M9vMmzhokBAQ%3d&amp;risl=&amp;pid=ImgRaw&amp;r=0" alt="炳灵寺石窟 - 国家艺术基金资助项目-丝绸之路中国段世界文化遗产数字展示与交流平台" width="621" height="405" aria-label="炳灵寺石窟 - 国家艺术基金资助项目-丝绸之路中国段世界文化遗产数字展示与交流平台" /></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">There are two ways to get there – a one-hour boat ride ($17) or a taxi, highly recommended because of the spectacular scenery. We climbed high above Liujiaxia through terraces laddering every inch of tillable ground on the barren, dry hillsides. Potatoes and corn are the main crops. Looking down, there was an impossibly steep, narrow, rutted dirt track descending into the rugged canyon below. To my surprise, that was the route to the grottos. The landscape was stunning with erosional features, pinnacles and rock towers. The ideal trip would be to take the boat one way and a taxi the other, but I doubt this is logistically possible.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>LABRANG MONASTERY,</strong> Xiahe. This monastic town attracts many tourists. Most are rural Tibetans, here to pray and seek spiritual fulfillment. The Xiahe area was once part of Tibet. Labrang Monastery was founded in 1709 by the first generation of a line of living Buddhas ranking third in importance after the Dalai Lama and Panchen lamas. Labrang is one of the six major Tibetan monasteries of the Yellow Hat sect of Tibetan Buddhism (the others are Danden, Sera and Drepung monasteries near Lhasa, Tashihunpo Monastery in Shigatse and Kumbum near Xining, Qinghai). At its peak, it housed 4000 monks, but the number greatly declined during the Cultural Revolution (called the anti-feudal revolution). Numbers are recovering and are currently restricted to 1800 monks, drawn from Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan and Inner Mongolia.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Access to most of the monastery is free, and you can spend hours walking around and soaking up the atmosphere in the endless maze of mud-packed walls. One of the best experiences is to show up between 6 and 7 am for the monk’s morning prayers. Walking the <em>kora</em>is is one of the highlights. This 3km path encircles the monastery and is the best way to grasp the layout, scale and significance of the monastery. Lined with long rows of squeaking prayer wheels, whitewashed chortens (Tibetan stupas) and chapels (many closed), most of the pilgrims on the kora appeared to be Tibetan with darker skin, traditional dress and a different facial appearance. Most were old, and some amazingly frail. Beggars were frequent. The 3-story <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Barkhang </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">is</span></span> the traditional printing press with 20,000 wood blocks used for printing. The <em>Gongtang Chorten</em> has access to the roof for views over the entire monastery. Tibetan monasteries are almost equal to the ones in Bhutan for opulent decoration: brilliantly painted frescoes, embroidery and carving.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Besides the kora, several main buildings require a tour: the Institute of Medicine, Manjushri Temple, Golden Temple, Prayer Hall, and a museum of relics and yak butter carvings.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Great Buddha Temple</strong>. Originally dating to 1098, this huge temple contains a 35 m-long sleeping Buddha – the largest clay-covered, wood-core Buddha in China (I guess this is a big deal). Until the 1960s, children could play inside the tummy of the Buddha. The main hall is one of the few wooden structures from this era still standing. The doors and woodwork are exquisite.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br /> MOGAO CAVES</strong>, Dunhuang. A Unesco World Heritage Site, these are one of the greatest repositories of Buddhist art in the world. First started in 368 AD, the site at its peak had 18 monasteries, more than 1600 monks and nuns, and countless artists, translators and calligraphers. Wealthy traders and important officials were the primary donors responsible for creating new caves, as caravans detoured to Mogao to pray and give thanks for a safe journey through the treacherous wastelands to the west. They were largely forgotten from 1300 until the 20th century, when they were “rediscovered” by many foreign archaeologists from 13 countries who visited and took priceless items (especially the 20,000+ manuscripts found in the library cave).</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Mogao is 10 km east of town near the railway station and is most cheaply visited on one of the free city buses. In busy seasons, it is recommended to reserve tours as this is an incredibly popular place. It is also expensive, like most good sites in China – 220 yuan ($38). One starts with two excellent films (make sure to get the English headsets), one shown in a theatre with a huge round screen on the ceiling (think planetarium). You then get a free English-speaking guide,e and I had her all to myself. The in-season tour includes 6 of the 492 caves (20 are rotated regularly) but they are all spectacular.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em>Northern Wei, Western Wei and Northern Zhou Caves</em>. These earliest caves are distinctly Indian in style and iconography, with central pillars representing a stupa, and slim statues with finely chiselled features. Lead-based paint, initially white, is oxidized to black. <em>Sui Caves </em>(581-618) still have Indian features. The 230 <em>Tang Caves </em>(618-907) were the high point as the Tang pushed China’s borders westward into Kazakhstan bringing diverse trade. The murals are still beautiful with the paint, especially on the ceilings, is remarkable. There are also two big Buddhas, one 26m tall and one 34.5m tall – a Maitreya Buddha, making it the world’s third largest Buddha. The post-Tang Caves introduced Tibetan influences. The Library Cave (#17) was discovered in 1900 (the room was completely disguised) with tens of thousands of immaculately preserved manuscripts dating to 406, texts of rare Central Asian languages, military reports, music scores, medical prescriptions, Confucian and Taoist classics, Buddhist sutras and the oldest printed book in existence, the Diamond Sutra (AD 868). Almost all were removed to the West. An excellent museum is outside the cave, telling the whole story.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Another good museum worth visiting is the Research Centre, where 8 caves are meticulously reproduced.<noscript><img decoding="async" class=" nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c1/98/59/c198598160039f920d99254eb71e29ab.jpg" alt="Mogao Caves - Wikipedia | Dunhuang, Dream destinations, Buddha" width="620" height="465" aria-label="Mogao Caves - Wikipedia | Dunhuang, Dream destinations, Buddha" data-bm="6" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload  nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20620%20465%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c1/98/59/c198598160039f920d99254eb71e29ab.jpg" alt="Mogao Caves - Wikipedia | Dunhuang, Dream destinations, Buddha" width="620" height="465" aria-label="Mogao Caves - Wikipedia | Dunhuang, Dream destinations, Buddha" data-bm="6" /><noscript><img decoding="async" class=" nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.3c682c15fb293d4dbe5b69b556fb96a4?rik=fS%2bzLPwMm%2bClVw&amp;riu=http%3a%2f%2f3.bp.blogspot.com%2f-bTfelZms4Iw%2fVCizySt9jfI%2fAAAAAAAAaZ0%2fbDUCFgVW3pM%2fs1600%2fIMG_0635BCorp.jpg&amp;ehk=rI78bHxsDWGMjADAzoCjLwxzLFP332ikXCZNBwvwlq8%3d&amp;risl=&amp;pid=ImgRaw&amp;r=0" alt="James Photography: Mogao Caves, Dunhuang, Gansu, China" width="620" height="413" aria-label="James Photography: Mogao Caves, Dunhuang, Gansu, China" data-bm="6" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload  nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20620%20413%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.3c682c15fb293d4dbe5b69b556fb96a4?rik=fS%2bzLPwMm%2bClVw&amp;riu=http%3a%2f%2f3.bp.blogspot.com%2f-bTfelZms4Iw%2fVCizySt9jfI%2fAAAAAAAAaZ0%2fbDUCFgVW3pM%2fs1600%2fIMG_0635BCorp.jpg&amp;ehk=rI78bHxsDWGMjADAzoCjLwxzLFP332ikXCZNBwvwlq8%3d&amp;risl=&amp;pid=ImgRaw&amp;r=0" alt="James Photography: Mogao Caves, Dunhuang, Gansu, China" width="620" height="413" aria-label="James Photography: Mogao Caves, Dunhuang, Gansu, China" data-bm="6" /></span></p><div id="mainImageViewer"><div id="mainImageWindow" data-m="{&quot;mid&quot;:&quot;033C01D39A268B1EC61A03DD8C350E259B3A565C&quot;,&quot;purl&quot;:&quot;https://www.pinterest.com/pin/509751251568172653/&quot;,&quot;murl&quot;:&quot;https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c1/98/59/c198598160039f920d99254eb71e29ab.jpg&quot;,&quot;turl&quot;:&quot;https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Q99ypg_4u-_de5fPVNQqDwHaFj&amp;pid=Api&quot;}"><div class="mainImage wide notbkg current curimgonview" role="main"><div class="richImage "><div class="mainContainer "><div class="imgContainer"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>TIBET<br /> </strong><strong>LHASA.</strong> Lhasa is the traditional, political and spiritual center of the Tibetan world.<br /> <strong>BARKHOR.</strong> It’s difficult not to be swept up in the tide of humanity that is Barkhor, a kora or pilgrim circuit that winds clockwise around the Jokhang Temple. The crowd of pilgrims is captivating &#8211; they come from all over Tibet. White ovens belch the smoke of incense burning. The most impressive were two men prostrating themselves every few meters, wood and metal sliders on their hands.<br /> Jakhang Temple (85¥). This 1300-year-old, Unesco-rated temple is the spiritual heart of Tibet with the continuous movement of pilgrims prostrating themselves outside. The golden roof lines foretell the ancient interior with frescoed walls and carved pillars. The central golden Buddha here is the most revered in all of Tibet.<br /> <strong><br /> POTALA PALACE</strong>. Once the seat of the Tibetan government and the winter residence of the Dalai Lama, it is Lhasa’s cardinal landmark. The first sight of the towering maroon, yellow and white fortress-like walls will be remembered for a long time. An architectural wonder even by modern standards, the palace rises 13 stories from the top of a 130 m-high mountain and contains more than 1000 rooms.<br /> The first recorded use of the site dates from the 7th century when a palace was built here. Construction of the present structure began during the reign of the 5th Dalai Lama in 1645 and took more than 50 years to complete. Zhou Enlai sent his own troops to protect it from the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution.<br /> The layout includes the rooftop White Palace used for government and the residence of the Dalai Lama, and the central Red Palace used for religious functions. The most stunning chapels house the jewel-bedecked golden chorten tombs of previous Dalai Lamas. The apartments of the 13th and 14th Dalai Lamas in the White Palace offer a more personal insight into life in the palace.<br /> Before we went into the Potala Palace, we had some time to wander around. I parked myself on a bench on the <em>kora</em> that goes around the palace. This may be the best people-watching in the world as pilgrims from all over Tibet come here. Prayer beads are in the left hand, and a prayer wheel is twirling in the right. Most are older and many are truly ancient but spry for their apparent age. Their skin was dark and leathery. But others are stooped with slow shuffling gaits, limps, using canes or crutches and their determination to walk the kora is impressive. Traditional dress varies but is most often a long skirt with a colourful striped apron and multiple necklaces of turquoise, amber, coral, glass and wood. Some push baby strollers.<br /> <strong>Drepung Monastery</strong> (30¥). 8 km west of the old town, it was purportedly the largest monastery in the world with around 7000 resident monks at its peak. The kings of Tsang and the Mongols visited regularly, though oddly, the Red Guards pretty much left it alone. Around 600 monks reside here now.<br /> <strong>Sera Monastery</strong> (60¥). 5 km north of central Lhasa, it was founded in 1439, and along with Drepung, was one of the great Gelugpa (Yellow Hat) monasteries. 600 monks, down from 5000, reside here. The spectacular prayer halls had ornate carvings and metalwork backing up the many Buddha images. In the afternoons, you can see Tibetan-style religious debating with lots of hand slapping and gesticulating.<br /> West of Lhasa, the people practice natural burial systems: either chopping up and putting the bodies in the river or sky burials where the bodies are eaten by birds. The bones are then collected, cremated and the ashes put in the river.</p><p></span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>TASHILHUNGO MONASTERY</strong>, Shigatse. Since the time of the Mongol sponsorship of the Gelugpa (Yellow Hat) order, Shigatse has been the seat to the Panchen Lama, the second-highest-ranking lama in Tibet. One could view the Dalai Lama, stationed in Lhasa, as the political leader and the Panchen Lama as the religious (and more scholarly) leader.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">This is one of the six great Gelugpa monasteries (along with Drepung, Sera and Ganden monasteries in Lhasa, Kumbum in Qinghai Province, and Labrang in Gansu). Built in 1447, the monastery is the size of a small village. It is divided into four main chapels. The <em>Temple of Maitreya</em> contains the 27m statue of Jampa (Maitreya) Buddha, the largest copper-gilded Maitreya Buddha in the world. The other three chapels contain the chorten tombs of the 4th, 10th, and 5th to 9th Panchen Lamas). All opulent, they are silver and gold (the 10th is covered in 500kg of gold) structures encrusted with jewels. The metal work is outstanding with the four directional gods on the sides. A simple turquoise, glass and precious stone swastika is embedded in the floor outside one of the chapels.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>SAKYA</strong><strong>.</strong> In the 14th century, this monastic town, with the help of Mongol military support, became the short-lived ruler of all Tibet. The main monastery, built in 1298, is a massive fortress-like compound with high defensive walls. The serene assembly hall is easily the most impressive of any we have seen: multiple Buddha images and tomb chortens displaying marvellous metal work. The hall also contains one of Tibet’s great libraries, with Buddhist manuscripts everywhere.</span><strong>SHAGAR MONASTERY and FORT</strong><strong>.</strong> Most people stay here for their last sleep before heading to Everest Base Camp, about 100 km south. Above the town is a monastery/fort with a defensive wall climbing the virtually vertical ridge. After walking to the monastery and snooping around, we climbed up to the wall with its crumbling battlements and red guard towers. Unfortunately, most of the wall had been destroyed in the Cultural Revolution.<br /> <strong>Bongphu Monastery</strong>. A few kilometres from Everest Base Camp, this is the highest monastery in the world (5000m) and the first monastery in Tibet.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>INDONESIA</strong></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>BOROBUDUR</strong><strong>.</strong> 42km NW of Yogyakarta, Borobudur is one of the most important Buddhist sites in the world and one of the finest temple complexes in SE Asia and is Unesco World Heritage listed. Constructed at the same time as Prambanan in the 9th century, it was abandoned as Buddhism waned and was covered in volcanic ash in the eruption of 1006. It was not rediscovered until 1814 by the British.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The temple consists of six square bases topped by three circular ones. The square ones have 1500 narrative bas-relief panels illustrating Buddhist teachings and 432 Statues of Buddha sitting in chambers on the terraces. On the upper circular terraces are 72-latticed stupas each containing a Buddha image. All is capped off with a large stone stupa. We walked around each terrace in a clockwise direction (most Muslims went the other way). The best way to see Borobudur is at sunrise when mists shroud the valley and crowds are small.<br /> <noscript><img decoding="async" class=" nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src="https://miviaje.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/templo-borobudur.jpg" alt="Templos de Indonesia que no debes perderte — Mi Viaje" width="620" height="464" aria-label="Templos de Indonesia que no debes perderte — Mi Viaje" data-bm="6" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload  nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20620%20464%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://miviaje.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/templo-borobudur.jpg" alt="Templos de Indonesia que no debes perderte — Mi Viaje" width="620" height="464" aria-label="Templos de Indonesia que no debes perderte — Mi Viaje" data-bm="6" /><noscript><img decoding="async" class=" nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src="https://i0.wp.com/escapemanila.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/borobudur-temple.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1" alt="Fascinating Tales and Facts About Borobudur Temple of Indonesia ..." width="621" height="414" aria-label="Fascinating Tales and Facts About Borobudur Temple of Indonesia ..." /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload  nofocus" tabindex="0" role="button" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20621%20414%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://i0.wp.com/escapemanila.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/borobudur-temple.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1" alt="Fascinating Tales and Facts About Borobudur Temple of Indonesia ..." width="621" height="414" aria-label="Fascinating Tales and Facts About Borobudur Temple of Indonesia ..." /></span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>TAJIKISTAN</strong></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">In the Antiquities Museum in the capital, Dushanbe is this 13m-long sleeping Buddha moved from Ajina Teppe in 1966, when Soviet archaeologists sliced it into 92 pieces.

I parked on top with lots of parking rather than down below where all the tour buses are. <picture><img decoding="async" class="MosaicAsset-module__thumb___yvFP5 alignnone lazyloaded" src="https://media.gettyimages.com/id/1318575518/photo/wat-tham-suea-in-sunrise-time-at-kanchanaburi-province.jpg?s=612x612&amp;w=0&amp;k=20&amp;c=6eHnXcT2pnFAaG8uSz437zEk-lYk844RKCDoLOzpqvA=" alt="wat tham suea in sunrise time at kanchanaburi province - wat tham sua stock pictures, royalty-free photos &amp; images" width="617" height="411" data-src="https://media.gettyimages.com/id/1318575518/photo/wat-tham-suea-in-sunrise-time-at-kanchanaburi-province.jpg?s=612x612&amp;w=0&amp;k=20&amp;c=6eHnXcT2pnFAaG8uSz437zEk-lYk844RKCDoLOzpqvA=" /></picture></span></p><div class="entry-content"><section class="gallery"><div class="zI7 iyn Hsu" data-layout-shift-boundary-id="CloseupPageBody"><div class="XiG zI7 iyn Hsu" data-test-id="CloseupMainPin"><div class="feh s7I zI7 iyn Hsu" data-test-id="closeup-body-landscape"><div class="hs0 mQ8 un8 C9i TB_"><div class="Jea XiG zI7 iyn Hsu"><div class="CCY S9z DUt e8F BG7" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-disabled="false"><div class="OVX mQ8 oy8 zI7 iyn Hsu"><div class="XiG zI7 iyn Hsu"><div class="fev sLG wfr z4_ zI7 iyn Hsu"><div class="Jea mQ8 zI7 iyn Hsu"><section class="detail-page travel-detail"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12 nopadding"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"><div class="relational-article-wrapper"><div class="owl-relational owl-carousel owl-theme owl-loaded"><div class="owl-stage-outer"><div class="owl-stage"><div class="owl-item cloned"><div class="item"><div class="img-wrapper"><div class="img-inner-wrapper"><div class="below-info"><div class="info-wrapper"><h3><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Wat Huay Mongkol,</strong> Thap Thai.

Arrive around 8:00 AM, purchase flowers and incense that are then recycled back into the place where purchased and the money used for upkeep for the Wat. The tattoos are done in groups of about 20 people choosing from a large banner of tattoos available. Unless there is a specific choice requested, the monk will begin with a simple tattoo at the top of the back. The monk uses a single long thin needle about 18 inches in length and the tip of the spike is split into two so that each stab of the spike produces two dots of ink done on a template to transfer the design. The typical tattoo takes about 3,000 strikes to complete. The sanitation of the needle and ink are unknown.

The temple was built by King Jayavarman VII of the Khmer Empire in the early 13th century. Jayavarman intended for the temple to be an important location in the royal cult surrounding himself, and showcased the prestige of the Khmer Empire in Lopburi. Of Khmer architecture, the temple is made of brick with an absent stucco exterior, three towers, each with a corresponding deity. Originally dedicated to Mahayana Buddhism, it was later rededicated to Theravada Buddhism.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">An image of Phra Prang Sam Yod is featured on a Thai baht note. While it remains the site of active prayer, several sources have noted that the temple is more popular as a tourist destination due to its resident population of monkeys. The temple is in relatively poor condition.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_3-1" class="reference"><br /> </sup><em><span id="Monkeys" class="mw-headline">Monkeys. </span></em>The temple is famous for its large population of crab-eating macaque monkeys that live in the temple grounds. Monkeys have always been present in Lopburi, but the Monkey Buffet Festival in 1989 led to a dramatic increase. The festival draws tourists while honouring the traditional Lopburi belief that monkeys are disciples of <i>Jao Paw Phra Kan</i>, a spirit which protects the city.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">There are 2 other archaeological sites in the city – one is a huge pile of laterite blocks.

During the Joseon Dynasty, the government oppressed Buddhism and supported Confucianism. Around 1550, Bongeunsa was expanded and became the head monastery of the national Jogye Seon Order. It was also the main Korean Buddhist Zen temple from 1551 to 1936. In 1939, and again during the Korean War (1950-1953), most of the temple buildings were heavily damaged or destroyed by fire.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The highlight of the temple, though, is a 28-meter stone statue of Maitreya, the Future Buddha. This statue is one of the tallest stone statues in the country. It has a platform with a stupa on its head. The oldest remaining building is a library that was constructed in 1856.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Today, Bongeunsa Temple is pleasant and peaceful.

The spatial arrangement of the seven temples that comprise the property, established from the 7th to 9th centuries, presents common characteristics that are specific to Korea – the ‘madang’ (open courtyard) flanked by four buildings (Buddha Hall, pavilion, lecture hall, and dormitory). These mountain monasteries are sacred places, which have survived as continuous living centres of faith, spiritual practice, and daily religious practice of Korean Seon Buddhism.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">They demonstrate self-sufficient temple management, education of monks, and coexistence of meditative practice and doctrinal studies despite suppression during the Joseon Dynasty and damages caused by wars and conflicts over the years.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Sansa consists of seven Buddhist mountain monasteries—Tongdosa, Buseoksa, Bongjeongsa, Beopjusa, Magoksa, Seonamsa and Daeheungsa – diverse Buddhist schools.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Buseoksa</strong> is a Buddhist temple located near Mt. Bonghwang, Yeongju City. Founded by the prominent scholar-monk Uisang in 676, Buseoksa is also well known as the “Temple of the Floating Stone”.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The temple’s main hall is the Muryangsujeon, located at the highest level where Amitabha is enshrined. It is the second oldest standing wooden building in South Korea, reconstructed in 1376. A few buildings from the Goryeo era (9th century to the late 14th century) remain until now, including Muryangsujeon.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Buseok Temple is located on a steep mountain, and the architects built stone walls along the slope and then arranged the buildings accordingly.<sup id="cite_ref-auto_6-0" class="reference"></sup> There are nine stone walls on the temple grounds and nine sets of stairs linked to the stone walls, representing the nine stairs toward Mandala or the nine staircases that one must traverse to reach Nirvana.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><sup id="cite_ref-auto_6-1" class="reference"></sup>As the oldest building, the temple cherishes several assets: 5 national treasures.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Muryangsujeon Hall</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Stone lantern in front of Muryangsujeon Hall</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Josadang Hall of Buseoksa temple</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Seated clay statue of Amitabha Buddha</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Wall painting in Josadang Hall of Buseoksa Temple</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>My experience</strong>.

The buildings of Janggyeong Panjeon, which date from the 15th century, were constructed to house the woodblocks, which are also revered as exceptional works of art. As the oldest depository of the <em>Tripitaka</em>, they reveal an astonishing mastery of the invention and implementation of the conservation techniques used to preserve these woodblocks.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">They were carved in an appeal to the authority of the Buddha in the defence of Korea against Mongol invasions.

It has three areas – Birojeon (the Vairocana Buddha Hall with a seated gilt bronze Buddha), Daeungjeon (the Hall of Great Enlightenment with three very nice relics), and Geungnakjeon (the Hall of Supreme Bliss with a seated gilt bronze Amitaba image). These areas and the stone terraces were designed to represent the land of Buddha. The stone terraces, bridges, and the two pagodas – Seokgatap (Pagoda of Sakyamuni) and Dabotap (Pagoda of Bountiful Treasures – this is a tremendous pagoda with pillars, a cap and a spire) – facing the Daeungjeon attest to the fine masonry work of the Silla.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The Japanese burnt the temple in 1593, and rebuilt and renovated it in 1969-70.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The Grotto is a 7.4 km drive up a winding, switchbacked road.

With the surrounding portrayals of gods, Bodhisattvas, the Ten Disciples, Eight Divine Guardians, two Devas, and two Vajrapanis all carved realistically and delicately from white granite in high and low relief, it is considered a masterpiece of Buddhist art in the Far East.

I have been retired since 2006 and in that time have traveled every winter for four to seven months. The months that I am "home", are often also spent on the road, hiking or kayaking. 
I hope to present a website that describes my travel along with my hiking and sea kayaking experiences.<div id="author-link"> <a href="../../../../author/admin/index.html" rel="author"> View all posts by admin <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span> </a></div></div></div><div class="entry-utility"> This entry was posted in <a href="../../../../category/uncategorized/index.html" rel="category tag">Uncategorized</a>.
