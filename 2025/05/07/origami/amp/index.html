ByMaya Wei-Haas  Photographs and video byCraig Cutler    January 25, 2023 NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC     A cacophony of\u00a0barking alerts me to the cardboard box delivered to my front door. Packed inside is a single sheet of white corrugated plastic folded into what looks like a large suitcase. My canine companions take a curious sniff as I unfurl the rigid form, which spans nearly the width of my living room. Pushing outward on the creases of one side, I hear a shockingly loud\u00a0pop.                                        The dogs sprint for cover, scrambling across wood floors, while I frantically look for damage, heart pounding. But nothing\u2019s broken. Instead, the plastic suitcase has transformed, and suddenly a full-size kayak is sitting in my living room.  The boat, created by the company\u00a0Oru Kayak, is part of a scientific and technological revolution inspired by the centuries-old art of origami. What began as efforts to understand the math behind fold patterns has opened up surprising possibilities for manipulating the shape, movement, and properties of all kinds of materials\u2014filters of\u00a0face masks, the plastic of kayaks, even living cells.  \u201cI just can\u2019t keep up,\u201d says\u00a0Robert J. Lang, a preeminent origami artist who previously worked as a laser physicist. \u201cThat\u2019s a wonderful place for the field to be.\u201d                                                                        Origami artist and physicist Robert J. Lang folded both of these cranes out of single uncut squares of paper. Most early origami models were fairly simple, like the traditional crane in the left image. The complexity of the crane on the right\u2014from spindly limbs to feathered wings\u2014was once thought to be nearly impossible. But Lang, a pioneer in the use of mathematics in origami, designed the remarkably realistic paper bird using geometric concepts at the core of a program called TreeMaker, which he developed in 1993 to test whether computers could help design origami.                                                        This series of mountains and valleys harbors an astonishing property: It can compact or flatten with a single motion. Lang folded this example of tessellated origami using a sheet of paper, but the pattern has also been used to pack the solar array on board Japan\u2019s Space Flyer Unit, which deployed after the spacecraft\u2019s launch in 1995. The repeating angled creases allow a folded sheet to lengthen and expand at the same time. Known as Miura-ori, the pattern was described by astrophysicist Koryo Miura in the 1970s and is similar to others found in nature, such as the unfurling leaves of a beech tree.                                                            Shuguang Li was playing with a collapsible origami cylinder when, on a whim, he put it in a vacuum bag. Li, then a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard and MIT, pumped out the air and was surprised to see the shape contract as if he\u2019d pressed it with his hand. By testing other shapes, he realized that fold patterns and material stiffness controlled their motions, a discovery that led to the creation of these soft, strong, and lightweight robotic arms. Each arm acts like an artificial muscle, encased in a vacuum bag \u201cskin\u201d with an inner skeleton inspired by origami\u2019s folds. By varying vacuum pressure, Li can make the arms perform useful tasks, like lifting and grasping.                              The art of origami has existed in Japan since at least the 17th century, but there are hints of paper folding from long before. Initially, models were simple and\u2014because paper was expensive\u2014used largely for ceremonial purposes, such as the male and female paper butterflies known as Ocho and Mecho that festoon sake bottles at Shinto weddings. As paper prices fell, origami\u2019s uses spread to gift wrap, playthings, and even geometry lessons for kids.  Then, in the mid-20th century, origami master Akira Yoshizawa helped elevate paper folding to a fine art. He breathed life and personality into each creature he designed, from a stern-faced gorilla glowering out of sunken eyes to a baby elephant joyfully swinging its trunk. With the publication of his first origami book in 1954, Yoshizawa also made the art form more accessible, establishing an easily understandable language of dotted lines, dashes, and arrows that contributed to systems still used today.  In the late 1950s, Yoshizawa\u2019s delicate forms inspired\u00a0Tomoko Fuse, now one of the foremost origami artists in Japan. Her father gave her Yoshizawa\u2019s second origami book when she was recovering from diphtheria as a child. Fuse methodically crafted every model, and she\u2019s been entranced with origami ever since. \u201cIt\u2019s like magic,\u201d she says. \u201cJust one flat paper becomes something wonderful.\u201d  (Graphic: See the innovations that origami has inspired in the world around us)  Among her many achievements, Fuse is famous for her advances in modular origami, which uses interlocking units to create models with greater flexibility and potential complexity. But she thinks of her work as less about creation than about discovering something that\u2019s already there, \u201clike a treasure hunter,\u201d she says. She describes her process as if she\u2019s watching from afar, following wherever the paper leads her. \u201cSuddenly, beautiful patterns come out.\u201d  Indeed, origami taps into patterns that echo throughout the universe, seen in natural forms such as leaves emerging from a bud or\u00a0insects\u00a0tucking their wings. For these exquisite folds to become scientifically useful, however, researchers must not only discover the patterns but also understand how they work. And that requires math.  Putting numbers\u00a0to origami\u2019s intriguing patterns has long driven the work of\u00a0Thomas Hull, a mathematician at Western New England University in Springfield, Massachusetts. When I walk into his school\u2019s math department, I know immediately which office is his. The door at the end of the hall is ajar, revealing boldly colored paper folded in all manner of geometric shapes. The models fill every nook of the small room\u2014hanging from the ceiling, adorning the bookshelves, and surrounding the desktop computer. Hull himself is a riot of color and pattern; black and white spirals dance across his shoes, which are tied with purple laces. He\u2019s long been fascinated by patterns and still remembers unfolding a paper crane at age 10 and marveling at the ordered creases in the flat sheet.  There are rules at play that allow this to work, he recalls thinking. Hull and others have spent decades working to understand the mathematics governing the world of origami.  As we chat, Hull pulls out an array of models that are folded in intriguing shapes or move in unexpected ways. One is an impossible-looking sheet folded with ridges of concentric squares, which cause the paper to twist in an elegant swoop known as a hyperbolic paraboloid. Another is a sheet folded in a series of mountains and valleys called the Miura-ori pattern, which collapses or opens with a single tug. Dreamed up by astrophysicist\u00a0Koryo Miura\u00a0in the 1970s, the pattern was used to compact the solar panels of Japan\u2019s Space Flyer Unit, which launched in 1995.                                      This expanding disk lies at the center of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory\u2019s half-scale prototype for a starshade, which could become a vital part of the search for habitable worlds. Our galaxy has about as many planets as stars, but scientists, blinded by the starry backdrop of space, often can\u2019t view these orbiting worlds directly. By flying far in front of a space telescope to block starlight, the starshade could help the scientists get a clear look. The starshade\u2019s structure is based on a so-called flasher pattern, which allows it to coil into a cylinder for launch. Deployed, the shade (shown partially opened in the first image) would unfurl into a flat disk with petals like a flower.                        (Print and fold your own origami starshade.)  In the years since, origami has been applied to many different types of materials, including tiny sheets of cells. This unusual medium coats the self-folding structure created by\u00a0Kaori Kuribayashi-Shigetomi\u00a0at Hokkaido University. When probed, the cells contract, transforming flat structures into cellular \u201cLego blocks,\u201d as she says, that could one day aid in growing organs.  Despite origami\u2019s current popularity in\u00a0science and technology, researchers\u2019 early folding forays met resistance. Hull still remembers a discussion he had in 1997 with a program officer from the National Science Foundation (NSF), a U.S. government agency that supports research and education. Hull was outlining a potential project, when the program officer cut him off to say that the NSF would never fund \u201ca research proposal with origami in the title.\u201d  This skepticism wasn\u2019t limited to the United States.\u00a0Tomohiro Tachi, a prominent origami engineer at the University of Tokyo, looks down with a smile when I ask if he\u2019s ever faced resistance to his work. People in Japan, he says, often view origami as\u00a0child\u2019s play. But that perception has shifted over the past couple of decades, with the NSF spearheading much of the change.  During a temporary posting at the organization starting in 2009,\u00a0Glaucio Paulino\u00a0pushed to fund research involving origami. \u201cThe process was brutal,\u201d says Paulino, who is now a professor of engineering at Princeton. \u201cWe were always in the hot seat trying to defend the idea.\u201d  But the effort paid off. In 2011 the NSF issued the first of two calls for proposals mixing origami and science, and teams of researchers flocked to submit ideas. The move lent legitimacy to the burgeoning field\u2014and the use of origami in science blossomed.  \u201cThere was this resonance,\u201d Lang says. \u201cIt was something whose time had come.\u201d  Origami is now pushing the limits of what scientists think is possible, particularly at the tiniest of scales. On a blazing hot summer day, I meet up with\u00a0Marc Miskin, an electrical engineer at the University of Pennsylvania. Inside the airy lobby of UPenn\u2019s Singh Center for Nanotechnology, we peer through a bright-orange glass wall into a series of rooms where people dressed head to toe in Tyvek sit at microscopes or work under vent hoods. It feels like a world away from the colorful chaos of Hull\u2019s office, but origami may prove no less vital here.  Miskin and his students have been using the clean room to craft an army of robots no bigger than a speck of dust. Such tiny bots require big creativity. Gears and most other mechanisms with moving parts work best in the human-size world where momentum and inertia rule, Miskin explains. But that\u2019s not the case at tiny scales where forces like friction are enormous, causing everything to stick. Gears won\u2019t turn. Wheels don\u2019t spin. Belts don\u2019t run.  That\u2019s where origami comes in. Fold patterns will bend and move the same way at any size, at least theoretically. Created using the same techniques as the computer chip industry, Miskin\u2019s robots look like fat flakes with arms and legs. When exposed to a trigger, such as voltage, their limbs bend, helping them walk through a drop on a glass slide or wave at a passing amoeba.                                                      In 2007 Anton Willis, who\u2019d just completed a graduate degree in architecture, moved into an apartment in San Francisco that was so cramped he had to put his beloved kayak in storage. A magazine profile of Lang, the origami artist and physicist, gave him the idea for a solution to his space problem: a kayak that folded. He began crafting paper models, sometimes surreptitiously at work, from one continuous sheet to ensure the boat would be watertight. \u201cFor a while it was almost like crumpling up the paper to see how it can fold in on itself, and then refining from there,\u201d says Willis, who eventually founded Oru Kayak. The company now has a full line of foldable boats that compact in minutes and are priced on a par with traditional kayaks.                                                        Mathematicians don\u2019t fully understand the math behind this structure\u2019s elegant bends, which form as curving folds are added to circular sheets. \u201cYou get these really impressive 3D forms with very simple creasing,\u201d says Erik Demaine, a professor at MIT who designed the fold pattern with his father, Martin Demaine, also at MIT. Drawn to folding as a way to develop new magic tricks, the duo fell in love with the geometrical problems that origami presents. While curved creases don\u2019t yet have applications, Erik sees many possibilities in their simplicity and potential strength.                            The intricate fold pattern of Air99\u2019s Airgami face mask helps improve both fit and function. Crafted from a flexible N95-grade filter that\u2019s fused to a more rigid and foldable layer, the mask\u2019s edges stay flush to the face because of its particular pattern of creases. When flattened, it\u2019s two to three times the size of common N95 masks. Increasing a mask\u2019s surface area allows more air to pass through at once. \u201cIt\u2019s like breathing through a straw versus a big pipe,\u201d says Richard Gordon, Air99 co-founder and CEO.                                                                  This tiny robot\u2019s swirling folds allow it to twist as it collapses or expands. Often called the Kresling pattern, for design expert and architect Biruta Kresling, the folds have inspired the invention of cylindrical structures large and small, including this minuscule medical tool. Crafted by a team led by Ruike Renee Zhao, a mechanical engineer at Stanford University, the device could one day be vital in targeted drug delivery. Magnetic fields could direct the robot to move through the body multiple ways. For example, spinning propels it through liquid thanks to the geometry of its folds. Paired magnets on opposite ends of the cylinder force the folds to compress, pumping liquid medicine to a desired point.                              Miskin sees a world of possible ways these tiny bots could be used, from manufacturing to medicine. For now, though, pushing the limits is what\u2019s most important to him. \u201cIf you go after hard problems,\u201d he says, \u201cyou\u2019ll be rewarded with interesting technology.\u201d  Origami holds particular promise for biomedicine. For instance, a team led by\u00a0Daniela Rus, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, developed a robot that can fold to fit into a pill capsule. After the capsule is ingested, the bot unfolds and can be directed around the digestive system using programmable magnetic fields. An initial test demonstrated one possible use: removing swallowed button batteries from the stomach, a potentially deadly condition experienced by thousands of children each year. \u201cImagine embedding medicine or using it to patch a wound,\u201d Rus says. \u201cJust imagine a future of surgeries with no incisions, no pain, and no risk of infection.\u201d  These types of big dreams are where origami seems to help science flourish most. The venerable art form has provided a new tool kit to ignite the imagination and create technologies once thought impossible, including a kayak that folds down small enough to fit in a car\u2019s trunk.  On a bright fall afternoon I take my kayak for a spin on Virginia\u2019s Lake Accotink. The plastic suitcase draws curious looks from passersby as I unfold it. Perhaps one day folding forms will be seen as prosaic. But for now, origami will continue to spark wonder and excitement as it propels science, medicine, and technology into the future\u2014and keeps me afloat as I shove off from the lakeshore.                                      This rabbit was folded from a pattern generated by the Origamizer, a computer program designed by Tomohiro Tachi of the University of Tokyo for creating complex faceted shapes (note the bunny\u2019s mosaiclike appearance). The program helped spur the recent explosion of origami models. These folded forms are \u201clike a common language,\u201d Tachi says, connecting scientists across disciplines around the world and demonstrating the endless possibilities that unfold when art and science mix.                            Staff writer\u00a0Maya Wei-Haas, who covers science for the magazine, folded a thousand origami cranes for her wedding.\u00a0Craig Cutler\u00a0specializes in still life and environmental portraiture.

Lang folded both of these cranes out of single uncut squares of paper. Most early origami models were fairly simple, like the traditional crane in the left image. The complexity of the crane on the right—from spindly limbs to feathered wings—was once thought to be nearly impossible. But Lang, a pioneer in the use of mathematics in origami, designed the remarkably realistic paper bird using geometric concepts at the core of a program called TreeMaker, which he developed in 1993 to test whether computers could help design origami.</span></span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </figcaption></figure> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="VZTD UeCOM jIRH oimqG DjbQm UwdmX Xmrlz ReShI KaJdY lqtkC ssImf HfYhe RTHNs " data-testid="prism-GridContainer"> <div class="Kiog kNVGM nvpSA qwdi bmjsw " data-testid="prism-GridRow"> <div class="theme-e oBTii mrzah " data-testid="prism-GridColumn"> <div class="bigVG QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX OLpez "> <div class="ambientVideo"> <div class="ResponsiveWrapper"> <aside class="InlineElement InlineElement--content-width InlineElement--desktop InlineVideo" aria-label="Silent Video for Duplicate of Miura Fold"> <div class="SingleVideo"> <div class="AmbientVideoWrapper"> <div class="NatGeoVideoPlayer aspect-ratio--parent aspect-ratio--16x9 VideoPlayer"> <div class="VideoPlayer--placeholder absolute-fill"> <div class="MediaPlaceholder relative MediaPlaceholder--16x9 cursor-pointer" tabindex="-1" aria-hidden="true"> <figure class="Image aspect-ratio--parent MediaPlaceholder__Image"> <div class="Image__Wrapper aspect-ratio--child"><span class="acss38e22"><amp-img data-hero class="amp-wp-unknown-size amp-wp-unknown-width amp-wp-unknown-height amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://i.natgeofe.com/n/adab231c-142e-4da7-adff-0b3224adc581/00000185-df85-deb8-ade5-ffd78e5f0000.png?wp=1&amp;w=1280&amp;h=720" width="1000" height="400" layout="intrinsic"><amp-img fallback data-hero class="amp-wp-unknown-size amp-wp-unknown-width amp-wp-unknown-height amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://www.ronperrier.net/wp-content/plugins/accelerated-mobile-pages/images/SD-default-image.png" width="1000" height="400" layout="intrinsic"></amp-img></amp-img></span></div> </figure> <div class="MediaPlaceholder__Overlay absolute-fill flex flex-center-all"></div> </div> </div> </div> <p><button class="Button Button--sm Button--icon-noLabel AmbientVideoWrapper__Toggle AmbientVideoWrapper__Toggle--bottom_left" tabindex="0" aria-label="Pause"></button>This series of mountains and valleys harbors an astonishing property: It can compact or flatten with a single motion. Lang folded this example of tessellated origami using a sheet of paper, but the pattern has also been used to pack the solar array on board Japan’s Space Flyer Unit, which deployed after the spacecraft’s launch in 1995. The repeating angled creases allow a folded sheet to lengthen and expand at the same time. Known as Miura-ori, the pattern was described by astrophysicist Koryo Miura in the 1970s and is similar to others found in nature, such as the unfurling leaves of a beech tree.</p></div> </div> </aside> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="VZTD UeCOM jIRH oimqG DjbQm UwdmX Xmrlz ReShI KaJdY lqtkC ssImf HfYhe RTHNs " data-testid="prism-GridContainer"> <div class="Kiog kNVGM nvpSA qwdi bmjsw " data-testid="prism-GridRow"> <div class="theme-e oBTii mrzah " data-testid="prism-GridColumn"> <div class="bigVG QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX OLpez "> <div class="ambientVideo"> <div class="ResponsiveWrapper"> <aside class="InlineElement InlineElement--content-width InlineElement--desktop InlineVideo" aria-label="Silent Video for Compilation"> <div class="SingleVideo"> <div class="AmbientVideoWrapper AmbientVideoWrapper--videoPlaying"> <div class="NatGeoVideoPlayer NatGeoVideoPlayer--videoPlaying aspect-ratio--parent aspect-ratio--16x9 VideoPlayer"> <div class="VideoPlayer--placeholder absolute-fill"> <div class="MediaPlaceholder relative MediaPlaceholder--16x9 cursor-pointer" tabindex="-1" aria-hidden="true"> <figure class="Image aspect-ratio--parent MediaPlaceholder__Image"> <div class="Image__Wrapper aspect-ratio--child"><span class="acss38e22"><amp-img data-hero class="amp-wp-unknown-size amp-wp-unknown-width amp-wp-unknown-height amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://i.natgeofe.com/n/3304243f-c4f5-4cab-82b8-8cf8f2f1f5eb/00000185-df50-deb8-ade5-ffd678640000.png?wp=1&amp;w=1280&amp;h=720" width="1000" height="400" layout="intrinsic"><amp-img fallback data-hero class="amp-wp-unknown-size amp-wp-unknown-width amp-wp-unknown-height amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://www.ronperrier.net/wp-content/plugins/accelerated-mobile-pages/images/SD-default-image.png" width="1000" height="400" layout="intrinsic"></amp-img></amp-img></span></div> </figure> <div class="MediaPlaceholder__Overlay absolute-fill flex flex-center-all"></div> </div> </div> </div> <p><button class="Button Button--sm Button--icon-noLabel AmbientVideoWrapper__Toggle AmbientVideoWrapper__Toggle--bottom_left" tabindex="0" aria-label="Pause"></button></p></div> <div class="VZTD UeCOM jIRH oimqG DjbQm UwdmX Xmrlz ReShI KaJdY lqtkC HkWF HfYhe kGyAC " data-testid="prism-GridContainer"> <div class="Kiog kNVGM nvpSA qwdi bmjsw " data-testid="prism-GridRow"> <div class="theme-e oBTii mrzah " data-testid="prism-GridColumn"> <div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU eEzcu lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"> <div class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "><span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz acss38e22" data-testid="prism-truncate"><span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ ">Shuguang Li was playing with a collapsible origami cylinder when, on a whim, he put it in a vacuum bag. Li, then a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard and MIT, pumped out the air and was surprised to see the shape contract as if he’d pressed it with his hand. By testing other shapes, he realized that fold patterns and material stiffness controlled their motions, a discovery that led to the creation of these soft, strong, and lightweight robotic arms. Each arm acts like an artificial muscle, encased in a vacuum bag “skin” with an inner skeleton inspired by origami’s folds. By varying vacuum pressure, Li can make the arms perform useful tasks, like lifting and grasping.</span></span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </aside> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="FITT_Article_main_group_wrapper VZTD UeCOM jIRH oimqG DjbQm UwdmX Xmrlz ReShI KaJdY lqtkC ssImf HfYhe RTHNs iJVrZ " data-testid="prism-GridContainer"> <div class="Kiog kNVGM nvpSA qwdi bmjsw " data-testid="prism-GridRow"> <div class="theme-e oBTii mrzah " data-testid="prism-GridColumn"> <p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "><span class="acss38e22">The art of origami has existed in Japan since at least the 17th century, but there are hints of paper folding from long before. Initially, models were simple and—because paper was expensive—used largely for ceremonial purposes, such as the male and female paper butterflies known as Ocho and Mecho that festoon sake bottles at Shinto weddings. As paper prices fell, origami’s uses spread to gift wrap, playthings, and even geometry lessons for kids.</span></p> <p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "><span class="acss38e22">Then, in the mid-20th century, origami master Akira Yoshizawa helped elevate paper folding to a fine art. He breathed life and personality into each creature he designed, from a stern-faced gorilla glowering out of sunken eyes to a baby elephant joyfully swinging its trunk. With the publication of his first origami book in 1954, Yoshizawa also made the art form more accessible, establishing an easily understandable language of dotted lines, dashes, and arrows that contributed to systems still used today.</span></p> <p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "><span class="acss38e22">In the late 1950s, Yoshizawa’s delicate forms inspired <a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Tomoko-Fuse/author/B00J2PWVBK?ref=ap_rdr&amp;store_ref=ap_rdr&amp;isDramIntegrated=true&amp;shoppingPortalEnabled=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-testid="prism-linkbase">Tomoko Fuse</a>, now one of the foremost origami artists in Japan.

When I walk into his school’s math department, I know immediately which office is his. The door at the end of the hall is ajar, revealing boldly colored paper folded in all manner of geometric shapes. The models fill every nook of the small room—hanging from the ceiling, adorning the bookshelves, and surrounding the desktop computer. Hull himself is a riot of color and pattern; black and white spirals dance across his shoes, which are tied with purple laces.

Our galaxy has about as many planets as stars, but scientists, blinded by the starry backdrop of space, often can’t view these orbiting worlds directly. By flying far in front of a space telescope to block starlight, the starshade could help the scientists get a clear look. The starshade’s structure is based on a so-called flasher pattern, which allows it to coil into a cylinder for launch.

When exposed to a trigger, such as voltage, their limbs bend, helping them walk through a drop on a glass slide or wave at a passing amoeba.</span></p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="VZTD UeCOM jIRH oimqG DjbQm UwdmX Xmrlz ReShI KaJdY lqtkC ssImf HfYhe RTHNs " data-testid="prism-GridContainer"> <div class="Kiog kNVGM nvpSA qwdi bmjsw " data-testid="prism-GridRow"> <div class="theme-e oBTii mrzah " data-testid="prism-GridColumn"> <div class="bigVG QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX OLpez "> <div class="ambientVideo"> <div class="ResponsiveWrapper"> <aside class="InlineElement InlineElement--content-width InlineElement--desktop InlineVideo" aria-label="Silent Video for Oru Kayak"> <div class="SingleVideo"> <div class="AmbientVideoWrapper AmbientVideoWrapper--videoPlaying"> <div class="NatGeoVideoPlayer NatGeoVideoPlayer--videoPlaying aspect-ratio--parent aspect-ratio--16x9 VideoPlayer"> <div class="VideoPlayer--placeholder absolute-fill"> <div class="MediaPlaceholder relative MediaPlaceholder--16x9 cursor-pointer" tabindex="-1" aria-hidden="true"> <figure class="Image aspect-ratio--parent MediaPlaceholder__Image"> <div class="Image__Wrapper aspect-ratio--child"><span class="acss38e22"><amp-img data-hero class="amp-wp-unknown-size amp-wp-unknown-width amp-wp-unknown-height amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://i.natgeofe.com/n/47aa7bf6-8c3f-476a-9110-7307f1fd4c4c/00000185-c676-d823-a595-def6d5a20000.jpg?wp=1&amp;w=1280&amp;h=720" width="1000" height="400" layout="intrinsic"><amp-img fallback data-hero class="amp-wp-unknown-size amp-wp-unknown-width amp-wp-unknown-height amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://www.ronperrier.net/wp-content/plugins/accelerated-mobile-pages/images/SD-default-image.png" width="1000" height="400" layout="intrinsic"></amp-img></amp-img></span></div> </figure> <div class="MediaPlaceholder__Overlay absolute-fill flex flex-center-all"></div> </div> </div> </div> <p><button class="Button Button--sm Button--icon-noLabel AmbientVideoWrapper__Toggle AmbientVideoWrapper__Toggle--bottom_left" tabindex="0" aria-label="Pause"></button></p></div> <div class="VZTD UeCOM jIRH oimqG DjbQm UwdmX Xmrlz ReShI KaJdY lqtkC HkWF HfYhe kGyAC " data-testid="prism-GridContainer"> <div class="Kiog kNVGM nvpSA qwdi bmjsw " data-testid="prism-GridRow"> <div class="theme-e oBTii mrzah " data-testid="prism-GridColumn"> <div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU eEzcu lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"> <div class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "><span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz acss38e22" data-testid="prism-truncate"><span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ ">In 2007 Anton Willis, who’d just completed a graduate degree in architecture, moved into an apartment in San Francisco that was so cramped he had to put his beloved kayak in storage. A magazine profile of Lang, the origami artist and physicist, gave him the idea for a solution to his space problem: a kayak that folded. He began crafting paper models, sometimes surreptitiously at work, from one continuous sheet to ensure the boat would be watertight. “For a while it was almost like crumpling up the paper to see how it can fold in on itself, and then refining from there,” says Willis, who eventually founded Oru Kayak. The company now has a full line of foldable boats that compact in minutes and are priced on a par with traditional kayaks.</span></span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </aside> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="VZTD UeCOM jIRH oimqG DjbQm UwdmX Xmrlz ReShI KaJdY lqtkC ssImf HfYhe RTHNs " data-testid="prism-GridContainer"> <div class="Kiog kNVGM nvpSA qwdi bmjsw " data-testid="prism-GridRow"> <div class="theme-e oBTii mrzah " data-testid="prism-GridColumn"> <div class="bigVG QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX OLpez "> <div> <figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"> <div class="Kiog gTIDq DtvAy ZcEtc IRwwZ "> <div class="lZur asrEW "> <figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"> <div class="GpQCA lZur " data-testid="prism-ratio-frame"> <div class="FvQLF iLTd NqeUA UzzHi iWsMV "> <div class="lZur TmzDJ bmjsw " data-testid="prism-copyright-wrapper"><span class="acss38e22"><noscript><noscript><picture data-testid="prism-picture"><source srcset="https://i.natgeofe.com/n/cb53f259-2024-4ebb-8a0b-1206a03126b7/Origami-MM9183-elegant-bends-cropped.jpg?w=374&amp;h=561, https://i.natgeofe.com/n/cb53f259-2024-4ebb-8a0b-1206a03126b7/Origami-MM9183-elegant-bends-cropped.jpg?w=748&amp;h=1122 2x" media="(max-width: 374px)"><source srcset="https://i.natgeofe.com/n/cb53f259-2024-4ebb-8a0b-1206a03126b7/Origami-MM9183-elegant-bends-cropped.jpg?w=413&amp;h=620, https://i.natgeofe.com/n/cb53f259-2024-4ebb-8a0b-1206a03126b7/Origami-MM9183-elegant-bends-cropped.jpg?w=826&amp;h=1240 2x" media="(min-width: 375px) and (max-width: 413px)"><source srcset="https://i.natgeofe.com/n/cb53f259-2024-4ebb-8a0b-1206a03126b7/Origami-MM9183-elegant-bends-cropped.jpg?w=718&amp;h=1077, https://i.natgeofe.com/n/cb53f259-2024-4ebb-8a0b-1206a03126b7/Origami-MM9183-elegant-bends-cropped.jpg?w=1436&amp;h=2154 2x" media="(min-width: 414px) and (max-width: 767px)"><source srcset="https://i.natgeofe.com/n/cb53f259-2024-4ebb-8a0b-1206a03126b7/Origami-MM9183-elegant-bends-cropped.jpg?w=718&amp;h=1077, https://i.natgeofe.com/n/cb53f259-2024-4ebb-8a0b-1206a03126b7/Origami-MM9183-elegant-bends-cropped.jpg?w=1436&amp;h=2154 2x" media="(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px)"><source srcset="https://i.natgeofe.com/n/cb53f259-2024-4ebb-8a0b-1206a03126b7/Origami-MM9183-elegant-bends-cropped.jpg?w=1280&amp;h=1920, https://i.natgeofe.com/n/cb53f259-2024-4ebb-8a0b-1206a03126b7/Origami-MM9183-elegant-bends-cropped.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=3840 2x" media="(min-width: 1025px)"></picture></noscript></noscript><amp-img data-hero class="hsDdd NDJZt sJeUN IJwXl bmjsw TmzDJ DXqUA UMBA UbGlr  amp-wp-unknown-size amp-wp-unknown-width amp-wp-unknown-height amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://i.natgeofe.com/n/cb53f259-2024-4ebb-8a0b-1206a03126b7/Origami-MM9183-elegant-bends-cropped.jpg" width="1000" height="400" layout="intrinsic"><amp-img fallback data-hero class="hsDdd NDJZt sJeUN IJwXl bmjsw TmzDJ DXqUA UMBA UbGlr  amp-wp-unknown-size amp-wp-unknown-width amp-wp-unknown-height amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://www.ronperrier.net/wp-content/plugins/accelerated-mobile-pages/images/SD-default-image.png" width="1000" height="400" layout="intrinsic"></amp-img></amp-img></span></div>

Drawn to folding as a way to develop new magic tricks, the duo fell in love with the geometrical problems that origami presents. While curved creases don’t yet have applications, Erik sees many possibilities in their simplicity and potential strength.<br id="isPasted"><br>

Crafted from a flexible N95-grade filter that’s fused to a more rigid and foldable layer, the mask’s edges stay flush to the face because of its particular pattern of creases. When flattened, it’s two to three times the size of common N95 masks. Increasing a mask’s surface area allows more air to pass through at once. “It’s like breathing through a straw versus a big pipe,” says Richard Gordon, Air99 co-founder and CEO.<br>

Often called the Kresling pattern, for design expert and architect Biruta Kresling, the folds have inspired the invention of cylindrical structures large and small, including this minuscule medical tool. Crafted by a team led by Ruike Renee Zhao, a mechanical engineer at Stanford University, the device could one day be vital in targeted drug delivery. Magnetic fields could direct the robot to move through the body multiple ways. For example, spinning propels it through liquid thanks to the geometry of its folds. Paired magnets on opposite ends of the cylinder force the folds to compress, pumping liquid medicine to a desired point.</span></span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </aside> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="FITT_Article_main_group_wrapper VZTD UeCOM jIRH oimqG DjbQm UwdmX Xmrlz ReShI KaJdY lqtkC ssImf HfYhe RTHNs iJVrZ " data-testid="prism-GridContainer"> <div class="Kiog kNVGM nvpSA qwdi bmjsw " data-testid="prism-GridRow"> <div class="theme-e oBTii mrzah " data-testid="prism-GridColumn"> <p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "><span class="acss38e22">Miskin sees a world of possible ways these tiny bots could be used, from manufacturing to medicine.

The program helped spur the recent explosion of origami models. These folded forms are “like a common language,” Tachi says, connecting scientists across disciplines around the world and demonstrating the endless possibilities that unfold when art and science mix.</span></span></div>
