People. </strong>Accusing of being predatory with a bad rep, my impression of Egypts is very positive. Like most Muslim countries, the people are very nice and always try to help if asked. There are persistent touts everywhere &#8211; the Cairo Airport for example &#8211; but these are everywhere.<br /> Men with pigmented spots on their forehead are common. It is from praying and most Egyptians pray 5 times a day.<br /> <strong>2. Costs.</strong> Egypt is very cheap to travel. Hotels range in the 300-400 EP ($12-16), often private rooms in a hotel including breakfast. Food is one-third the cost of home. Buses are about $12 for 3-4 hour trips.</p><p>Egypt – Central &#8211; Cairo, Giza, Faiyum, Beni Suef, Minya &#8211; Dec 11-13, 2022<br /> <em>My original plan was to go to Ethiopia from Gambia via Istanbul on Turkish Air (a very cheap flight). I thought a VOA for Ethiopia was possible but found out when I was about to board that the VOA had been discontinued in November and I now needed an e-visa. I applied immediately but it did not arrive for three days. A new flight from Istanbul varied between $780 to $580 and I got tired of sleeping in the airport, so decided to change all my plans and start where I was going to end my attempt to see all the countries in north east Africa (Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Somaliland, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and souther Egypt). </em><br /> <em>I got a cheap flight (Pegasis and Egypt Air to Cairo via Sharm Elshiek for $250). This necessitated changing airports to Sabiha, so I bought a Turkey visa (CAD100, US$70 or 50€), took a bus transfer across Istanbul (1&#8217;10&#8221;) and flew to Sharm El Shiek where I slept in the airport for my fourth night in a row and arrived in Cairo on December 11 at noon. I got an Uber to Freedom Hostel.</em></p><p><strong>Day 2</strong> Dec 11,<em> I went to the Sudan Embassy and got a visa (the only place that does not require a LOI) for US$150 (see the explanation in the Sudan post that follows this). On Dec 12, I picked up my passport at the embassy and saw a few sites I had missed on my first trip to Cairo.<br /> </em><strong>Muizz Street.</strong> This is the most popular street in Old Cairo &#8211; cobbled and lined with many mosques, palaces and shops. I have been here before but did not see any of the attractions. Buy the Muizz Street Pass for 100 EP. I purchased a small brass inscribed bowl for 250EP.<br /> <strong style="font-size: 12pt;">Masjid Al Hakim.</strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> With two 1000 year-old minarets and mirhab, enter a 20-year-old mosque with huge courtyard and prayer hall.<br /> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>A&#8217;mr ibn Al-A&#8217;as Mosque.</strong> Not so interesting a mosque but get the attendant to open the locked door that leads down to the huge tank in the basement.<br /> <strong>Hamman Iral.</strong> Dates from 1456.<br /> <strong>Complex of Suklin al-Mansour Qalawin</strong>. This is where the Muizz Pass is purchased. Has a tomb, mosque (great ceilings and stained glass windows), madrassa, the first &#8220;psychiatric&#8221; hospital in the world.<br /> <strong>Khan el Khelli.</strong> A huge bizzar with jewelry shops and some amazing inlaid boxes.<br /> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Al Fattah Al Aleem Mosque. A huge new mosque with a huge courtyard and a lovely prayer hall.<br /> I then walked 2.3 km back to my hostel. The route passed an amazingly chaotic shopping street where all the merchandise encroached onto the street leaving a 5 foot wide walking lane. Then walk under a large freeway past street stalls all with blaring speakers.<br /> ON Freedom Hostel</span></p><p><strong>Day 3</strong> Dec 12. I left early to go to the Sudan Embassy to pick up my passport and hired an Uber to take me to the Observatory.<br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Helwan Observatory</strong> (03/11/2010). </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In 1865, the original Khedivial Observatory was founded at Abbasiya, a district north-east of Cairo for astronomical and magnetic research. In 1904, the Khedivial Astronomical Observatory was transferred to Helwan.<br /> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The <i>Khedivial Astronomical Observatory</i> in Helwan for astronomy, meteorology, actinometry and terrestrial magnetism, was built in 1903&#8211;1904 and sits on top of a limestone plateau (116m) about 30 km south of Cairo and 5 km east of the Nile.<br /> The stone/brick building has a 15-m high square tower with meteorological instruments.

There was an early 30-inch (76cm) Reflector (1902/05) f/4.5, presented to the observatory by the amateur astronomer and Birmingham industrialist John Henry Reynolds (1874&#8211;1949). The climate of Egypt is very suitable for astronomical photography during the greater part of the year: at times the atmosphere is so clear that stars are seen to set suddenly behind the desert horizon.<br /> It was the first large telescope in Africa. It was used for photographing nebulae, for classification of spiral galaxies, recording nebulae spectra, observing Halley’s comet (1909/10) and especially for the variable nebula NGC 6729 in Coronae Australis.<br /> Comets like Neujmin, Grigg-Skjellerup, Forbes, Tempel’s, Peltier Whipple, Kaho, Peltier, Jackson, Brook’s, Wolf’s, Borrelly’s, Quenisset’s, Beljawsky’s and Mellish were regularly observed. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">After the launch of the first satellite in 1957, telescopes and stations have been installed at Helwan Observatory for tracking artificial satellites. In addition, a horizontal solar telescope was errected in 1957 with Coelostat and spectrograph for the observation of sunspots, faculae and protuberances.<br /> </span><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Japanese Botanical Garden</span></strong> was created in 1917 in a park with a hill, a huge Buddha face carved out of a rock, a Japanese cottage and a flat area with a little bamboo forest and a big smiling Buddha statue but not many typical Japanese flowers or trees to be found. This abandoned garden is the only Japanese botanical garden in the Middle East.<br /> Note that the Google Maps location is not correct placing the observatory in the middle of a highway. the correct location is at 29° 51′ 31″ N, long. 30° 15′ 5.5″ E, elevation 116m above sea level.<br /> <em>I took an Uber here for a minimal Uber fee and then for 800 EP cash to Dahshur, The driver climbed down into the pyramid.</em><br /> <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Royal Necropolis of Dahshur </strong></span>(01/11/1994) is a royal necropolis located in the desert on the west bank of the Nile approximately 40 kilometres (25 mi) south of Cairo. It is known chiefly for several pyramids, two of which are among the oldest, largest and best preserved in Egypt, built from 2613–2589 BC.<br /> <span style="font-size: 16px;">The Dahshur pyramids were an extremely important learning experience for the Egyptians. It provided them with the knowledge and know-how to transition from step-sided pyramids to smooth-sided pyramids.<br /> The first of the Dahshur pyramids was the Bent Pyramid (2613–2589 BC), built under the rule of King Sneferu. The Bent Pyramid was the first attempt at building a smooth sided pyramid, but proved to be an unsuccessful build due to the miscalculations made on the structural weight that was being placed onto the soft ground (sand, gravel, and clay), which had a tendency to subside. The blocks weight was not distributed appropriately, causing the angle of the pyramid to be off and achieving the name “the Bent Pyramid”.<br /> <sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"></sup>Realizing his shortcomings and learning from his mistakes, King Sneferu ordered the building of the second pyramid of Dahshur, the Red Pyramid. It was smooth sided, and a free standing pyramid rising to a height of 341 feet (104 meters), with an angle of 43 degrees. The Red Pyramid’s name reigns from the material that was used to construct the pyramid, red limestone. This pyramid is believed to be the resting place of King Sneferu.<br /> The White Pyramid is that of the 12th Dynasty King Amenemhat II (1929–1895 BC). This pyramid has not been preserved as well.<br /> The Black Pyramid dates from the later reign of Amenemhat III and, although badly eroded, it remains the most imposing monument at the site. The polished granite pyramidion or capstone of the Black Pyramid is on display in the main hall of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.<br /> From the parking area, climb up several steps to the entrance into the center of the pyramid. It is a steep descent while crouching over. Steel bars on the wood base provide braking power. Enter the first room with a high imposing corbelled roof. Climb some stairs and enter the second room, identical but larger. Repeat to exit. It is very hot and hard work with a strong smell of guano. 60 EP<br /> <img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47722" src="https://mlrhpz8jmuut.i.optimole.com/cb:Ie5o.50122/w:710/h:399/q:mauto/https://www.egypttoursplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cairo-pyramids-tours.jpeg" alt="Cairo Pyramids Tours" width="710" height="399" /><br /> <em>I then took an Uber for 800 EP to Ramaya Square (near the Giza Pyramids) to get a minibus to Fayoum. This was another 800 EP. The drive through Giza must be one of the ugliest cities in the world &#8211; completely large apartment buildings (most around 12 stories and many unfinished). Ramaya Square is a huge minibus station. I found the next van to Fayoum quickly just before it filled so we had little to wait. I sat next to a nice guy, a civil engineer who helped me find a hotel in Fayoum. </em><br /> ON Honey Day. 400 EP/night with breakfast. I withdrew more money, had a surprisingly good hamburger for dinner and then spent the rest of the evening trying to find a car (and driver) for the next day.<br /> <strong><br /> FAYOUM </strong></span>is a city in Middle Egypt 100 km southwest of Cairo, in the Faiyum Oasis, It is one of Egypt&#8217;s oldest cities due to its strategic location. <sup id="cite_ref-Riggs_1-1" class="reference"></sup>Archaeological evidence dates it to the Epipalaeolithic and Neolithic eras. Habitation began in the fifth millennium BC and a settlement was established by the Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2181 BC) called Shedet (Medinet el-Fayyum). It was the most significant centre of the cult of the crocodile god Sobek and the Greeks called it &#8220;Crocodile City&#8221;. The city worshipped a tamed sacred crocodile.<br /> Ptolemy II Philadelphus (309–246 BC) renamed the city <i>Arsinoë</i> and also established a town at the edge of Faiyum named <i>Philadelphia</i>. <sup id="cite_ref-McKenzie_13-0" class="reference"></sup>Under the Roman Empire and was called &#8220;Arsinoë in Arcadia&#8221;.<br /> Today, Faiyum has several large bazaars, mosques,<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"></sup> baths and a much-frequented weekly market.<sup id="cite_ref-EB1911_31-0" class="reference"></sup> The canal called Bahr Yussef runs through the city with four waterwheels that were adopted as the symbol of Fayoum.<br /> <strong>Oasis of Fayoum, hydraulic remains and ancient cultural landscapes </strong>(28/07/2003) is a depression or basin in the desert immediately to the west of the Nile, or just 62 miles south of Cairo, and is between 1,270 km<sup>2</sup> (490 mi<sup>2</sup>) and 1,700 km<sup>2</sup> (656 mi<sup>2</sup>).

It was on the fringe of the desert away from the cultivated lands on the south side of the lake, so it was rather of a frontier outpost. Retired Roman soldiers preferred to live in the villages to the south like Philadelpha and Karanis.<br /> Goods from the Fayoum were transported across the lake by boat to be unloaded at the docks of Dimeh, stored, or carried up the Avenue of the Lions, assessed for a customs fee, and reloaded on animals for desert caravans. These caravans moved north over Gebel Qatrani and probably via Wadi Natrun to the Mediterranean and on to Rome.<br /> Here at Soknopiaou Nesos, as in other desert outposts in the Western and Eastern deserts, and along the northern coast, security systems were in place to protect caravans, but they did not always succeed. Dimeh was inhabited for six centuries and was finally abandoned by the middle of the third century AD.<br /> The ruins of Dimeh al-Siba contain two temples, houses, underground chambers, streets, and ten-meter-high walls that are sometimes up to five meters thick. The walls themselves are a testament to the survivability of mudbrick in the desert environment. The ground is strewn with debris. An uncountable number of shards cover the entire temple mound. They are all over the place.<br /> The city itself was spread out over a great distance through the desert, and the mudbrick walls that are still standing did not contain the entire town, but only the temple area. To the north were the agricultural fields, separated by long irrigation canals. To the south was the Gate of Soknopaios, at the end of the Avenue of the Lions, which ran down to the edge of the lake where the docks were located. Today, one can still see the remains of this road, which ends about a kilometer to the south of the ruins at a quay.

Because the pyramid-building age was over or maybe because they could not afford to construct their own pyramids, they chose the limestone cliffs of the eastern desert overlooking a gentle curve in the Nile as an ideal spot on which to carve their tombs.

Arteam, a group made up of three Greek artists in 1997, covers an area of about 10 hectares (25 acres).<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"></sup> It consists of 89 protruding cones of gradually increasing size set in a spiral and another 89 depressed (incised) cones set in spirals. The sand dug out from the depressed cones was used to create the protruding cones, resulting in the displacement of 8000 cubic meters (10500 cubic yards) of sand. At the center of the art piece used to be a body of water 30 meters (98 feet) in diameter which has since evaporated.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"></sup> The artwork is subject to natural erosion and in due course, the area will revert to the original desert plain. It is viewable by satellite pictures via Google Earth.<br /> The artists have stated that the project was meant to suggest an experience of infinity with the desert as a landscape of the mind.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"></sup> Even though it is in a state of slow disintegration, Desert Breath is still viewable two decades after its creation.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"></sup> Through its slow disintegration, the installation has been seen as an instrument to measure the passage of time.<br /> I took a bus to the El Gouna turn-off and then an Uber about 5 km north along the main north-south highway. I had not read about it and not understanding, found it underwhelming. It is in the middle of nowhere next to the highway and appears to be many perfectly conical mounds of grey sand. It is not eroding but has many weeds and the lake is of course gone. From the ground, the spiral shape is not so obvious. I thought I had come to the wrong place.

A passport is required to enter at the highway gate. Then it is about 12 km to the beach next door to Moods Restaurant.</em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br /> </span><strong>El Gouna Beaches.</strong> There are several beaches including Zeytuna Beach located on its own island, Mangroovy Beach, Moods Beach, and other hotel beaches. I visited Moods Beach fronting two large resorts. The sand was manicured and there were many beach recliners with umbrellas, round beach loungers with grass roofs, and weathered white folks.<br /> <strong>El Gouna Aquarium.</strong> This small aquarium is hard to find. It is on an inside island. The displays are small and show Red Sea creatures. 5€ <em>I walked 2.5 km from the beach to the aquarium and the Go Bus stand. 20 EP back to Hurghada. </em></p><p><strong>Day 5</strong> Sun Dec 13.<em> After two nights in Hurghada, I took a Go-Bus to Luxor. </em></p><p><strong>I didn&#8217;t see the following<br /> </strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Sharm El Naga beach.</strong> Near Soma, it is 70 km south of Hurghada.<br /> <strong>Soma</strong></span></p><p><strong>MARSA ALAM*. </strong>Town in south-eastern Egypt, located on the western shore of the Red Sea. It is a popular tourist destination. Beaches: Abu Dabab beach, turtles are common, crocodilefish and octopuses. Marsa Alam is also known as a world-class kitesurfing destination and the perfect starting point for safaris. Marsa Alam also has some inland attractions, such as the Emerald Mines and the Temple of Seti I at Khanais.<br /> Despite being over 135 miles (217 km) km north of the tropical zone, the city experiences a hot desert climate. The temperature of the Red Sea at this location during the year ranges from 22 to 29 °C (72 to 84 °F).<strong><br /> </strong></p><p><strong>DIVING:</strong> The Red Sea resorts at Sinai peninsula, including Sharm El Sheikh and Ras Mohammed, diving in The Gubal Strait, the wrecks at the Strait of Tiran, reef diving in Hurghada and Marsa Alam, the Abu Nuhas wreck system, and pelagic encounters at Brother Islands, Dahab. Shallow reefs, walls, drift dives, coral gardens and some of the most famous wrecks in the world in crystal clear waters. Many species of sharks.<br /> It is possible to dive all year round. However the water temperature does vary a lot: From July to September, it is the hottest month with a water temperature of about 28°C. The coldest month is February with a water temperature of about 21°C.<br /> From October to November, you can expect from 25°C to 27°C. From March to June, the water is warming up with temperatures ranging between 22°C to 25°C.<br /> There is not really one single “best diving season” in the Red Sea but if you don’t like crowded dive sites, try to avoid the high season from July to December. If you do go during the busy period, you should book your hotel well in advance.</p></div><p><strong>Bird Migration Routes</strong>. Tentative WHS (12/06/2003).<br /> <em><strong>Bardawil Lake</strong></em> is on the coast, has an area of about 59,000 ha, and is a Ramsar Site. It consists of two interconnected hypersaline lagoons, with interspersed islands and peninsulas. The site provides important spawning areas for fish and supports commercially important fish stock, mainly the mullet. It is also an important wintering and staging area for about half a million birds in 244 bird species, 18 reptiles.<br /> Salt extraction and the constant formation of sand bars (siltation) close the channels connecting the lagoons with the Sea. These channels are vital for the annual migration of mullets from the Sea to the Lake and vice versa. The El-Salam irrigation Canal, bringing water from the Nile mixed with agricultural drainage water from the eastern Delta pollutes the Lake<br /> <strong><em>Zaranik Scrubland</em>.</strong> Migration and wetland hotspot east of Lake Bardawil about 35 km west of El-Arish,. The site consists of a lagoon, beach, and desert scrub vegetation (68% water and 32% land). It is an excellent site for autumn migrants.<br /> <strong><em>Gebel Shayeb El-Banat</em>.</strong> Near Hurghada, it comprises four mountains: Gebel Abu Dukhan (1705 masl), Gebel Qattar, Gebel Shayeb El-Banat (the highest peak in the Red Sea coastal mountains), and Gebel Umm Anab.<br /> The shoreline is a chain of coral reefs up to 100 m wide.<br /> Ma’aza tribe, known as Bani Attia (pop 1000) living in an area of 90,000 sq. km. They are pastoral nomads, raising sheep, goats, and camels with no fixed dwellings.<br /> <em><strong>Saluga and Ghazal Nile Islands</strong></em> Granitic outcrops of fine grained granite. The 94 species of vegetation is the relicts of a Nile Valley gallery forest. Trees of six species of Acacia dominate the plant communities<br /> <em><strong>Lake Nasser</strong></em> is A huge man-made water reservoir extending 300 km upstream of the Aswan High Dam in Egypt and continues as Lake Nubia for another 200 km in Sudan. It has an average width of 10 km. On completion of the construction of the High Dam in the early 1970s, the Lake covered the entire Nubian Nile Valley in both Egypt and Sudan and deeply penetrated into the surrounding desert through the numerous wadis (dry desert rivers) that drained from the Eastern (the majority) and the Western Deserts, about 80 all in all, the largest of them being Wadi Allaqi. This gives the Lake its dendritic shape in satellite images. The climate is extremely arid with very hot summers and cold winters.<br /> A yearly fluctuation of as much as 30 m and large wetlands have formed in the deltaic mouths of the dry wadis where they join the Lake. It is increasingly important as a wintering area for migratory Palaearctic water birds. Important Bird Areas of Egypt especially water birds (herons, ducks, waders, and terns).</p><p><strong>Mountain Chains.</strong> Tentative WHS (12/06/2003).<br /> <strong><em>Yelleg, Halal, and Maghara Mountains</em></strong> Yelleg (1087 m), Halal (892 m), and Maghara (750 m), are isolated highlands with the only conifer tree in Egypt, Juniperus phoenicia, 200 species of vascular plants  including a rare assemblage of rare, vulnerable, and threatened species<br /> Gebel Dokhkhan See Gebel Shayeb El-Banat Site<br /> <em><strong>Gebel Elba</strong></em> region in the south-eastern corner of Egypt lies adjacent to the border of Sudan, and the Red Sea. Average annual rainfall is 50 mm/year, but moist north-easterly winds bring as much as 400 mm. This creates “mountain oases”, or “mist oases” on the slopes of these mountains. Habitat types include Red Sea coral reefs, Mangroves, Low shore-line coastal dunes, Littoral salt marsh belts.<br /> Many species are threatened with extinction: African wild ass, the addax antelope, the Tora red hartebeest, the dama gazelle, and the scimitar-horned oryx.<br /> The traditional home of several hundred nomadic Bisharin tribesmen, whose language and some of their traditions can be traced to the Ancient Egyptian language and traditions.<br /> <em><strong>Gebel Oweinat Region</strong> </em>Formidable mountain in the centre of the flat and featureless Western Desert of Egypt and it stands out like an island from the surrounding plain. The last rainfall was seen in September 1998 and as much as 10 to 15 years may pass without a drop. Yet this little rain is sufficient to allow vegetation and some wildlife to survive.<br /> The western part lies entirely in Libya and forms a large granite ring complex about 25 km in diameter, being the eroded remnants of a large archaic granite dome. Two permanent springs, Ain Ghazal and Ain Doua, can be found at the southern foot and have never gone dry in living memory. A heavily used desert track passes by along the western rim of the Mountain, linking Kufra with El-Fasher in western Sudan. Site<br /> <em><strong>The Gilf El-Kebir Plateau</strong></em>. A landscape similar to Mars and one of the driest regions of the Earth. Remote and not yet been fully explored. It is a high, flat-topped plateau (a few basalt flows) of Nubia sandstone covered with a thick red soil with vertical escarpments on all sides, 200 to 300 m above the surrounding desert. It is dissected by numerous canyon-like dry wadis. The soil indicates heavy rainfall in older times.</p><p><strong>OTHER DESTINATIONS</strong><br /> <strong>Bir Tawil.</strong> M@P<br /> <strong>Hala’ib Triangle.</strong> Egypt/Sudan – M@P, XL<br /> <strong>El Ikhwa island</strong><br /> <strong>Shadwan Island<em><br /> </em>Foul Bay area</strong>, XL</p><p><strong>Wadi el Gemal NP</strong><br /> <strong>Brothers Islands Lighthouse</strong></p></div><div class="printfriendly pf-button pf-button-content pf-alignleft"> <a href="index.html#" rel="nofollow" onclick="window.print(); return false;" title="Printer Friendly, PDF & Email"> <noscript><img decoding="async" class="pf-button-img" src="https://cdn.printfriendly.com/buttons/printfriendly-pdf-email-button-md.png" alt="Print Friendly, PDF & Email" style="width: 194px;height: 30px;"  /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload pf-button-img" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://cdn.printfriendly.com/buttons/printfriendly-pdf-email-button-md.png" alt="Print Friendly, PDF & Email" style="width: 194px;height: 30px;"  /> </a></div></div></div><div id="entry-author-info"><div id="author-avatar"></div><div id="author-description"><h2> About admin</h2> I would like to think of myself as a full time traveler.
