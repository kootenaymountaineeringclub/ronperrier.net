Super well done with drones only of Cap Haitian </span><span class="acss8af2a">and the video of the most beautiful parts here: https://youtu.be/ApyjDPNh4vs</span></p> <p><strong>OBSERVATIONS </strong><br>
1. As the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, Haiti’s poverty is glaring. 75% make<br>
their living in the service economy. Everyone is out there eking out a living in some basic way: selling something – the street market in Cape Haitian is gigantic – occupying at least 3 X 10 blocks of streets, all impenetrable to vehicles as the lanes between stalls can only be walked. And the other market occupying a garbage tip on the beach is also large with different goods (used clothing, charcoal and produce). The average income is less than US$2/day. The paper money is filthy.<br>
75% of people don’t have running water in their homes. Electricity is erratic, blackouts daily and generators are a must. Mosquitos are common at night due to all the standing water.<br>
<strong>2. People.</strong> Virtually everyone is black with few brown people. Shortly after independence in 1804, the president killed all the whites (over 3,000 people). You don’t see anyone who is fat. Most people look healthy but thin. No one smokes.<br>
Begging: non-existent in Cap Haitian, very common in Port-au-Prince.<br>
<strong>3. Garbage</strong> is devastating in Cap Haitian. I have never seen anything like it. One downtown half street was piled high. Old plastic bottles are black and flattened. The beach and water was covered in plastic. A market exists on a garbage tip on the beach. There is no attempt to clean it up.<br>
In PaP, it is much cleaner and comparable to India. I even saw a large garbage truck with 6 men removing a large pile near the main square. Some of it is smoking as they try to burn it.<br>
<strong>4. Safety.</strong> Cap Haitian is very safe, PaP is completely unsafe south of a few blocks from the main town square. One can’t drive anywhere there or along the coast to Jacmel (via Carreforre) without a 100% risk of carjacking or kidnapping. There are 160 gangs that control vast areas of south Haiti dealing in drugs, prostitution and kidnapping.<br>
<strong>5. Costs.</strong> It is cheap on the streets and using moto-taxis and tuk-tuks, but hotels and taxis are relatively expensive. Hotels have to provide their own electricity, water and armed guards to be able to provide security.</p> <p><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"></sup><span class="acss8af2a"><em>I took the Caribe Tours bus from Santo Domingo on March 28 (8 am, 1,750 DR + US$37 departure tax, 7 hours with all the immigration) to Cap Haitian, Haiti, in the north. We crossed the border at Ounaminthe-Dajabon. I stayed at Habitacion Des Lauiers (US$50/night),  a lovely hotel, a short steep walk above downtown. I think it is the best hotel in Cap Haitian as it is well run and has electricity all the time because of its two generators. Screens keep the mosquitos out. </em></span><span class="acss8af2a"><em>The rooms were simple but very adequate. I stayed two nights and had great sleeps and didn’t need a fan. The mosquitos though are particularly well but I opened my door quickly to not let any in.<br>
</em><em>On the bus, I sat next to a lovely Mexican guy, Jaime who has also traveled extensively. He was a life-saver as he was organized. We had both arranged the same hotel and took a taxi arranged by the hotel, $10 each (very expensive) up to the hotel, even though it was only a 1.9 km walk uphill. </em></span></p> <p><em><span class="acss8af2a">After a good breakfast, we walked down through town. Cap Haitian (compared to Port au Prince – PaP) is very safe with no kidnapping or crime.</span></em><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><strong>Our Lady of the Assumption Cathedral.</strong> This is a nice 3-nave church with wonderful wood ceilings in the nave, cross, and altar. We were shown around by two guys who were exuberant about their church. All the Ways of the Cross had been stolen. We gave them $5 for the great tour. They said there is a tunnel all the way from The Palace to under the altar was used by Henri Cristophe to get to the church. </span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><em>We then continued our walk through downtown to the Old Market (Pont Neuf Market), situated on the beach on top of a garbage dump. It is huge with sections devoted to clothes (all used Western clothes), charcoal, and food. The people hate having their photos taken so I only took a few of the wares. </em></span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><em>The garbage in OCap is devastating. An entire half street is full of it. It is everywhere especially on the beach. I have never seen anything remotely close in my previous 149 countries. Open sewers and a lot of standing water contribute to the mosquito problem.<br>
</em></span></p> <p><span class="acss8af2a"><strong>Citadel, Sans Souci, Ramiers World Heritage Site.</strong></span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><b>Palace of Sans-Souci</b> was the principal royal residence of Henry I, King of Haiti, better known as Henri Christophe. It is located in the town of Milot, approximately five km northeast of the Citadelle Laferrière, and thirteen km southwest of the Three Bays Protected Area.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">The palace’s name, French for “carefree”, is shared with both Sanssouci, Frederick the Great’s palace in Potsdam, Germany, and with Haitian Revolution military leader Jean-Baptiste Sans Souci, who was executed by Henri Christophe in 1803. The palace was built between 1810-1813 by an undetermined number of workers.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">The residence accommodated the king, his family, Queen Marie-Louise, and their children, along with their royal staff of advisors. It was the most important of nine palaces commissioned by the king, as well as fifteen châteaux, numerous forts, and sprawling summer homes on his twenty plantations. The nearest airport and large city is Cap-Haïtien.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">Before the construction of Sans-Souci, Milot was a French plantation that Christophe managed for a period during the Haitian Revolution. Many of Henri Christophe’s contemporaries noted his ruthlessness, and it is unknown how many laborers died during the palace’s construction. Under his reign, the palace was the site of opulent feasts and dances. It had immense gardens, artificial springs, and a system of waterworks.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">Though Sans-Souci is now an empty ruin, at the time its splendor was noted by many foreign visitors. One American physician remarked that it had “the reputation of having been one of the most magnificent edifices of the West Indies.”<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><br>
</sup>Close to the Palace is the renowned mountaintop fortress; the Citadelle Laferrière, built under a decree by Henri Christophe to repel a feared French invasion that never occurred. It is reached by continuing on the trail behind the Palace.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">Crippled by a stroke, then King Henri I committed suicide on the grounds of the palace on October 8, 1820. According to Haitian legend, he shot himself with a silver bullet. He was subsequently buried in the Citadelle. The gun is in the National Museum in PaP.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">His son and heir, Jacques-Victor Henry, Prince Royal of Haiti was bayoneted to death by revolutionaries at the Palace on October 18, 1820.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">A severe earthquake in 1842 destroyed a considerable part of the palace and devastated the nearby city of Cap-Haïtien; the palace was never rebuilt.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">The palace shares its name with another Haitian revolutionary leader, Colonel Jean-Baptiste Sans Souci. He was an African slave who may have taken his name from the <i>quartier</i> near the parish of Grande Rivière where he first led troops in guerrilla fighting against the French in 1791. When Henri Christophe and other military leaders split from the French, they asked Sans Souci to join their ranks, but he declined and particularly viewed Christophe as a traitor. About ten years before the construction of his palace, the future Haitian king sent Colonel Sans Souci a conciliatory message inviting him to one of his headquarters at the main Grand Pré plantation, adjacent to the Milot plantation where he would later build the palace. When Sans Souci arrived, Christophe’s guards bayoneted him and his small band of guards to death. Sans Souci Palace was built only a few yards away, or perhaps even exactly over, the place where Sans Souci the man was killed by Christophe.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"></sup>Some scholars have also asked whether Christophe took part of his inspiration for the palace from the Prussian king Frederick the Great’s palace in Potsdam, Sanssouci, a symbol of European Enlightenment achievement. Other scholars argue, the palace’s architecture is inspired by the Boffrand’s designs for the Château de la Malgrange for Leopold, Duke of Lorraine, near Nancy.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">In any event, the palace’ splendor was remarked upon by various visitors, generally acknowledged by many to be the Caribbean equivalent to the Palace of Versailles in France. Proud of its magnificence, the Palace of Sans-Souci was an important step in Henri Christophe’s plan to demonstrate to foreigners, particularly Europeans and Americans, the power and capability of the black race. The African pride in the construction of the king’s palace was captured by the comment of his advisor and architect, Pompée Valentin Vastey (Baron Valentin de Vastey), who said that the palace and its nearby church, “erected by descendants of Africans, show that we have not lost the architectural taste and genius of our ancestors who covered Ethiopia, Egypt, Carthage, and old Spain with their superb monuments.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">UNESCO designated it—and the Citadelle—World Heritage Sites in 1982. Described as “one of the most remarkable attractions in the Western Hemisphere”, the Palace of Sans-Souci is “seldom visited by foreigners” due to “decades of political instability and lawlessness” in Haiti.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><em>We had arranged a driver, the entrance, moto and horse at the hotel for $140 for both of us but decided it would be more fun, and much cheaper to do it alone. At the market we found a tuk-tuks to the Citadel and were offered anything from $100 to $20. Frandy Stolen (WatsApp +509 34152699) was a gem of a guy who drove us the 20 km to Milot, waited for us, and drove us back for $20.<br>
</em>The palace is in the town of Milot. We paid $10 each to enter (but in retrospect, I think there is no fee and the charge is for a guide). Jaime is a soft touch. Then the hard bargaining began. Starting at $100, we bargained him down to $40 for the moto, guide, and one horse. </span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">The palace is a complete ruin. The stone/brick edifice is 3 stories but the floors and roof are all gone. The grounds have several other ruined buildings including a hospital and a pool.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><b>Citadelle Laferrière</b> (Citadelle Henri Christophe, or simply the Citadelle), is a large early 19th-century fortress situated on the Bonnet à l’Evêque mountaintop in Nord, Haiti.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"></sup> The imposing structure is located approximately 27 km south of the city of Cap-Haïtien, 15 km southwest of the Three Bays Protected Area, and 8 km uphill from the town of Milot. Commissioned by Haitian revolutionary Henri Christophe, and built by tens of thousands of former slaves,<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"></sup> the Citadelle was the linchpin of the newly independent Haiti’s defensive strategy against potential French incursion.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><sup id="cite_ref-auto_3-0" class="reference"></sup>Including several smaller forts across the country, the stronghold remains the only African-derived military fortification in the New World as well as the first example of African-derived colonial architecture; which it shares with Sans-Souci Palace, also commissioned by Christophe. Designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1982—along with the aforementioned Sans-Souci, the fortress is universally regarded as an icon of the Caribbean nation.</span><br>

<span class="acss8af2a">Commissioned in 1805 by Henri Christophe and completed in 1820, the fortress was built as part of a system of fortifications designed to thwart potential foreign incursions; notably the French. During the stronghold’s conceptual phase, Christophe was a general in the Haitian army and chief administrator of the country’s northern regions. The ensuing power struggle he had with his rival and fellow revolutionary Alexandre Pétion, would result in his self-declaration as king of Northern Haiti in 1811.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">The Citadelle, constructed by over 20,000 ex-slaves, was built several kilometres inland atop the 900-metre (3,000 ft) Bonnet à l’Eveque mountain, as a means of providing the optimal military vantage point. The location enabled Haitian forces to strategically keep watch over a vast distance, from the nearby valleys to the coastline. Cap-Haïtien and the adjoining Atlantic Ocean are visible from the roof of the fortress. It is the largest fortress in Haiti and one of the largest in the New World; it continues to serve as a symbol of Haitian independence.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">The Haitians outfitted the fortress with 365 cannons of varying size, assembled from the abandoned munitions left behind by the European forces that formerly occupied the island. The enormous stockpiles of 8,000 cannonballs still sit in pyramidal stacks at the base of the fortress walls. Since its construction, the fortress has withstood numerous earthquakes, though a French attack never came and it was eventually abandoned.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">In the event of an invasion, Christophe planned to have his military burn the valuable crops and food stocks along the coast, then retreat to the fortress, setting ambushes along the sole mountain path leading to the Citadelle.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">Christophe suffered a stroke in 1820, and some of his troops mutinied. Shortly afterwards, he committed suicide—according to legend, by shooting himself with a silver bullet. Loyal followers covered his body in quicklime and entombed it in one of the Citadelle’s interior courtyards to prevent others from mutilating the corpse.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"></sup>The colossal physical dimensions of the fortress have made it a Haitian national symbol, featured on currency, stamps, and tourist ministry posters. The fortress walls rise 40 metres (130 ft) from the mountaintop and the entire complex, including cannonball stocks but excluding the surrounding grounds, covers an area of 10,000 square metres (110,000 sq ft). Workers laid the large foundation stones of the fortress directly into the stone of the mountaintop, using a mortar mixture that included quicklime, molasses, and the blood of local cows and goats—and cows hooves that they cooked to a glue and added to the mix to give the mortar added strength and bonding power.<amp-img data-hero class="thumbimage amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_3.jpg/300px-Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_3.jpg" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_3.jpg/450px-Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_3.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_3.jpg 2x" alt="" width="300" height="195" layout="intrinsic"><amp-img fallback data-hero class="thumbimage amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://www.ronperrier.net/wp-content/plugins/accelerated-mobile-pages/images/SD-default-image.png" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_3.jpg/450px-Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_3.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_3.jpg 2x" alt="" width="300" height="195" layout="intrinsic"></amp-img></amp-img></span><br>

<span class="acss8af2a">Citadelle Laferrière aerial view from a US Army UH-60 Black Hawk during Operation Unified Response, after the 2010 Haiti Earthquake<br>
Large cisterns and storehouses in the fortress’s interior were designed to store enough food and water for 5,000 defenders for up to one year. The fortress included palace quarters for the king and his family, in the event that they needed to take refuge within its walls. Other facilities included dungeons, bathing quarters, and bakery ovens. Also visible is the tomb of Christophe’s brother-in-law, killed when the gunpowder room he was in exploded.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">The Citadelle’s appearance from the trail leading up to its base has been likened to the prow of a great stone ship, jutting out from the mountainside. The structure is angular and assumes different geometric forms based on the viewer’s orientation. Some of the angles on the Citadelle were intentionally put there by Christophe to deviate cannonballs if attacked and the Epaulette is a great example of using angles to deviate and deflect shots. Though most of the fortress has no roof as such (the interior top is a latticework of stone walkways), some slanted portions are adorned with bright red tiles. The fortress has been repaired and refurnished several times since its construction, including in the 1980s with help from UNESCO and the World Monuments Fund, though little of it has been replaced and its design remains the same.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">Tourism. The Citadelle is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Haiti. Directions to and history of the fortress are provided by self-appointed guides from the town of Milot. Near the entrance to Sans-Souci Palace, which is at the start of the trail to the Citadelle, visitors may be asked to pay a small fee. Visitors are also encouraged to rent a horse for the uphill trek. The first portion of the 11 kilometre (7 mi) trail is navigable by 4WD vehicle, although infrequent landslides and construction projects sometimes make this unreliable. Numerous people live along the trail and sell souvenirs or drinks, such as fresh coconut juice, to travelers. Drinks are a necessity in the tropical heat. There were also “bamboo” players (a digerido-like instrument and a flute player.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">The trail is paved stone, generally smooth and in good condition. About three-quarters of the way up from the parking lot, visitors must complete the final portion on horseback or on foot. The entire 11-kilometre (7 mi) trail, starting in Milot, is almost completely uphill, but can be walked by experienced hikers who carry plenty of water. Most of the interior of the Citadelle fortress itself is accessible to visitors, who may also climb the numerous staircases to the fortress’s roof, which is free of guardrails. On a clear day, the city of Cap-Haïtien and the Atlantic Ocean can be seen to the north. Because of its elevation the top of the Citadelle is used by United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) for a Radio repeater, with an antenna on the highest point.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">Though the turbulent political situation in Haiti (principally in the central region) has deterred visitors in recent years, the regions of the north and south of the country remain largely peaceful, making travel to the Citadel less challenging or hazardous than travel within the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince.</span><br>

<span class="acss8af2a">Aerial view of a nearby gun emplacement<br>
From the Palace, walk a short distance to get a moto taxi. It took 17 minutes to drive to the parking area and 32 minutes for me to walk up to the Citadel itself.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">It is one of the most amazing WHS I have seen. It is completely intact. Walk up stairs to the inside galley with 10 beautiful bronze cannons still on their carriages (made from 1746-56 in France) and other galleries with more cannon onto the roof and views in all directions. There are mutlitple rooms and galleries.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">We had negotiated a price of $40 for the 5 km moto taxi, guide and a horse for Jaime. The guide was completely useless and I refused to pay for him so Jaime (the soft touch) paid $30 and I paid $15 only for the 5 km moto ride, a fair price as he would normally only have got $10 as part of the original deal. My total cost $35 but $25 possible if entrance not paid).</span></p> <p><span class="acss8af2a"><em>On return, we were let off at the Old Market, Jaime returned to the hotel, and I walked the entire length of it – produce, charcoal (tons of sellers), and then second-hand clothes. Haitians hate their photo being taken and most refused or put a pan in front of their face. It is a crowded place with hundreds of stalls or places with wares spread on the ground. </em></span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><em>I then walked through the town back to the hotel. The entire downtown area (comprised of ten by three blocks has become an itinerant, pedestrianized market, most centered around the old Marche, a steel-girder market. You can buy anything here in this huge area. The city government has been unable to control the area and it probably continues to grow. It is easily the largest street market in the world.<br>
I had a hot dog on a stick (25 cents) and could not find a bin to throw the stick into, so carried it around for an hour. I could not throw it on the ground despite the garbage everywhere. </em></span></p> <p>Things I didn’t see:<br>

<span class="acss8af2a"><strong>Musée du Panthéon National Haïtien</strong> (National Museum) is a museum featuring the heroes of the independence of Haiti and the Haitian history and culture.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">The Musée du Panthéon National Haïtien was opened in 1983. This cultural center is to perpetuate and disseminate the memory of “Fathers of the Nation”. The museum traces Taínos, Spanish, and a section dedicated to the heroes of independence, including the silver gun with which Henri Christophe committed suicide, and the bell used to announce Haitian independence. It also contains slavery chains, torture instruments, sculptures, and temporary exhibitions of paintings. The museum also contains the anchor of the Caravel of Christopher Columbus, the Santa Maria measuring 4 meters high.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><strong>Maison Dufort.</strong> In the NM House and Biographical Museum series,  it is the first construction site school for the Gingerbread restoration project for the rehabilitation of the houses by creating a workshop school for young masons and carpenters for the dissemination and training in ancient construction techniques. <strong><em><br>
</em>Desalines Monument. Jean-Jacques Desalines </strong>(1758–1806) initially served as an officer in the French Army, but became a commander in the revolt against France and subsequently the leader of the Haitian Revolution. He defeated the French army in 1803 and declared Haiti an independent nation in 1804. This officially ended the only slave rebellion in world history that successfully resulted in establishing an independent nation. Dessalines was chosen by a council of generals to assume the office of Governor-General. He ordered the 1804 Haiti massacre of the white Haitian minority, resulting in the deaths of between 3,000 and 5,000 people. In 1804, he proclaimed himself Emperor Jacques I of Haiti and ruled in that capacity until being assassinated in 1806. Dessalines is regarded as a founding father of Haiti.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><strong>Le Marron Inconnu</strong> (The Unknown Maroon”)is a bronze statue of a runaway slave, better known as a maroon, standing in the center of Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Completed on September 22 1967 by Haitian architect Albert Mangonès, the statue is regarded as a symbol of black liberation; commemorating in particular, the rallying cry that sparked the Haitian Revolution and the abolishment of slavery. Situated across from the National Palace,<sup id="cite_ref-Girard2011_8-0" class="reference">[8]</sup> it is the nation’s most iconic representation of the struggle for freedom.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">It measures 3.60 metres long by 2.40 metres high. It depicts in bronze a near-naked fugitive black man, kneeling on one knee, his torso arched, his opposite leg stretched back, and a broken chain on his left ankle. He holds a conch shell at his lips with his left hand, his head tilted upward to blow it, while the other hand holds a machete on the ground by his right ankle.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">Mangonès chose a passage from 1 Maccabees 14:3-9 of the Jerusalem Bible to be set in copper letters on one of the two concrete panels that protect the “eternal flame” of freedom in the square surrounding the statue.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><strong>Atis Rezistans,</strong> In the NM Bizzarium series, on<span class="section-start-text"> </span>Boulevard Jn J Dessalines set back from the main road behind a muddle of motorbikes and old cars, the wrought iron gate which marks the entrance is presided over by a human skull, red and white Christmas lights poking gaudily from its gaping eye sockets. Beneath the skull, a Latin slogan reads: “E Pluribus Unum”; <em>out of many, one</em>.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">The place is a museum, an art collection, and a gallery. No matter what you call it, this courtyard tucked away behind the boulevard seems to defy any standard definition. The open-air space is crammed full of sculptures, ranging from palm-sized figurines through to towering daemonic effigies that hunch menacingly over the heads of visitors.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">If there is one uniting theme to this collection, other than the artists’ obvious penchant for the macabre, then it is the notion of salvage and recycling. The founding sculptors of the Haitian collective, André and Celeur, grew up around the area of Grand Rue in Port-au-Prince. Born out of a climate of “junkyard make-do, survivalist recycling, and artistic endeavor,” their self-taught artistic skills reflect the challenges of growing up in such an environment. Theirs is a unique and yet well-defined artistic style, one which prescribes the juxtaposition of metal and flesh, wood and bone. The work of the Grand Rue sculptors is often challenging. Disturbing, even. Children’s dolls appear stitched onto vacuum cleaners, while twisted automobile parts have been joined to human remains to create bizarre and otherworldly totems.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">Now working with an expanded team of sculptors and artists, André and Celeur continue to use everyday items to tell new stories. The symbology of their work incorporates powerful themes of death and rebirth; of Vodou, Christianity and occultism; of slavery, of inevitable industrialization and its dystopian sci-fi aftermath.</span></p> <p><span class="acss8af2a"><em>From Debjeet Sen’s excellent trip report on FB Every Passport Stamp.</em></span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">It is possible to have a safe and interesting visit to Haiti, if you go with the correct people and are aware of the security situation. Having a guide for Port-au-Prince was especially essential. The security situation in town is fluid and can be very bad in places. For example, the neighborhood near the ruined cathedral was blockaded by gangs, and the closer one gets to the water.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">Moreover, there are several interesting sights that are difficult to find on your own, as they are tucked into rough and/or obscure neighborhoods.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">An excellent guide, Claude (many thanks to Suhas for the tip) to take me around town. He calls himself a “man of the street” and it shows. We walked around downtown and took moto-taxis to travel around some of the rougher neighborhoods and tap-tap’s to/from Petionville. I did not get the feeling it was safe to walk around much of downtown Port-au-Prince—even without taking photos—although short walks to the supermarket to pick up stuff and exchange money and to get food from a restaurant seemed fine. Claude’s can be easily engaged via Philip, the owner of Park Hotel, where I stayed. WhatsApp: +509 32 64 6351. Philip is excellent to help plan the trip.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">Philip also connected me to a taxi driver Gustana (WhatsApp: +509 37 50 0578) who also took me to Fort Jacques and Fort Alexandre in the mountains high above Port-au-Prince.

<span class="acss8af2a"><em>Port-au-Prince.</em> In general, I felt that it is possible to have a safe and interesting visit to Haiti, if you go with the correct people and are aware of the security situation.

<span class="acss8af2a">From Port-au-Prince, I flew on Sunrise Airways to Cap-Haïtien. The 20-minute flight avoids the 6–12-hour drive. In Cap-Haïtien, I stayed at Habitation des Lauriers (WhatsApp: +509 38 36 0885).</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><em>Palais Sans-Souci and La Citadelle.</em> It is perfectly straightforward to organize this day trip on public transport (tap-tap to Milot followed by moto taxi). The car dropped me at the upper parking lot, from where any reasonably fit person can hike to the Citadelle in 30–45 minutes. Lots of people will offer guiding services and a horse ride, but neither are needed in my opinion. The Citadelle is one of the coolest places I have visited—an absolute wonder. I saw Palais Sans-Souci on the way back—again avoiding any “guides.”</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><em>Cap-Haïtien</em> is very walkable, although there are powercuts at night and it may be a good idea to get a taxi after dark. I crossed over to the Dominican Republic on Caribe Tours’ daily bus service to Santiago/Santo Domingo. The bus leaves Cap-Haïtien daily at 8am.</span></p> <p><span class="acss8af2a"><strong>Stephan Muller.</strong> 25th September – 30th September 2021</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">Bus from Santo Domingo to Cap-Haitian for 37$ one way (Caribe Tours). No Covid test or return ticket required. Cap-Haitian is much better, relatively safe and incredible interesting. Don’t worry about kidnappings and assaults in that region. However, I was very lucky to find a nice and caring Couchsurfing host who assigned his friends to take me around and protect me. I posted their contact info in the video description (link below).</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">The journey was a bit inconvenient since the city is suffering under a almost permanent blackout and gas shortage. Most people use generators, but due to the gas shortage even those are problematic. I first stayed with my couchsurfing host for 2 nights (which were the best days I’ve had). Since he is the general manager of a good hotel he lives in a back building and has permanent access to their electricity and expensive hotels use power nearly 24h, so I didn’t even realize that the city has a power problem. However, as he had friends coming from Port au Prince, I had to move and the cheapest private place I could find, which was an Airbnb for 40$. There’s also a hostel for 20$/night. However, my Airbnb host rarely used the generator so I moved to a hotel with AC (50$), but also the hotel was stingy with the gas and I only had electricity from 11pm-4am. And that was the biggest problem, because I could not sleep well if I don’t even have a fan at 30C+.</span><br>

<span class="acss8af2a"><strong><br>
Orest Zub<br>
</strong>Travel independently. Spent 4 nights in total. During this time I visited Port-at-Prince, Cap Haitien, Citadel and a bit of countryside in between. It is absolutely doable on your own. I recommend one small backpack.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><em>Get in.<br>
</em>Ounaminthe-Dajabon border crossing in the north</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">AirCentury flies every other day or so from Santo Domingo to PaP ~400 USD return for 30 min flight. </span><span class="acss8af2a">AirAmerica and JetBlue.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">Immigration is easy and straightforward. Foreigners pay some kind of fee – 10 USD.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><em>Get Around<br>
</em>By car. Traffic is really bad. Once you get into the car you’re stuck forever. Don’t rent a car.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">From airport. Walk outside the airport 100 meter to the nearest petrol station for a motor taxi. 500 gourde (8 USD)</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">Taxi airport pickup is 25 USD. 20 km from city. 50 USD/day hire for a day.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">By plane. Fly from PaP to Cap with Sunrise air. 100 USD, 20 min.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">By bus. Cap Haitian to PaP. Sans-Sousis operator, 20 USD, 5 hours, AC</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">By moto. Useful everywhere. Most drivers are honest and I didn’t have to bargain hard for a ride. 100-200 gourde (1-3 USD) is normal for a couple km rides.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><em>Accommodation<br>
</em>Port au Prince. Park Hostel, actually a hotel in historical building with a nice hostel section in it. 17 USD/night. Situated on the central square of PaP inside large quite garden. Owner, Philip, super helpful</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">Just next to the hotel there is a modern supermarket with all the goods and secure currency exchange office. Nearby there is also a lively bar area where you can eat properly, drink beer and hang out with locals. No problem with it. Once a bunch of guys didn’t even permit me to pay my bill.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">Cap Haitien. Habitation des Lauriers, middle range hotel with fantastic views over the city. 50 USD for a budget room with breakfast. Don’t be afraid to walk up the slum towards hotel. Locals are fine with travelers there.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><em>See<br>
</em>PaP. Central area around Park Hotel with some admin buildings. I was advised not to move closer toward the sea into a slum. And didn’t do so reaching just the edge of it.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">Petionville. Little of interest. However, cross it anyway towards the surrounding mountains.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">Fort Jacques. great views over the city.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">L’Observatoire de Boutilliers. Food is overpriced and service was not good. Tips are not included into the bill.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">The rest of town is absolute mess. Think of Conakry or Monrovia. Probably even worse.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">Cap Haitien. Nice easy going town (only on the center) with a lot of preserved colonial architecture.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">Citadel. The largest military structure in Western Hemisphere and really a stunning UNESCO place. Take a moto from outside Cap Airport just after arrival which is 20 km away. 1000 gourde return with waiting. Entry ticket is 10 USD. Bike up and down the mountain (6-7 km one way) another 10 USD with local guys.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><em>People/Safety.</em> Everybody in Dominican Republic assured me it’s impossible to move around without security and guides. However I assure you it’s absolutely the opposite.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">During the entire 5 days I never felt unsafe or experienced any kind of hostility from locals. Everybody is super friendly, polite and honest. Even when people usually can take advantage of situations (e.g. drivers, night time, touristic spots) nobody used this chance or pushed hard.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">The only not very comfortable situation was the following. Once we approached village Milot (below Citadel) with my moto driver local guys started to follow us on bikes shouting to stop.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">My driver got a bit nervous but I calmly clap him on a shoulder and told not to stop. Once we reached ticket gates and stopped to buy a ticket locals explained that there is some kind of local tourist association in village.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">Since I’ve heard a lot of stories like this around the world we carried on with a drive uphill. However it’s get quite steep and my driver started to feel uncomfortable on the road. Eventually I decided to let him wait near the gate and took another local guy to drive me up for 10 USD (6-7 km). It’s always good to leave something in the community. Meanwhile their guiding offers and horse rides where not pushy at all.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><em>Inconveniences. </em>The most challenging in Haiti is probably finding proper food. Selection is not great and very expensive. A bowl of rice with questionable chicken on a bus stop – 7 USD. Simple Hamburger in high end restaurant – 13 USD. Pizza – 17 USD.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">I don’t understand how locals handle it since there are no tourists. I was always the only “le blanc” (white) around. Even fruits are not easy to get. The bar area near Park Hotel in PaP is a real gem.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">Always use your chance to grab a normal bite. Have breakfast in hotels and don’t mind stopping if you see something okay-ish.</span></p> <p><span class="acss8af2a"><strong>HAITI – GENERAL INFO</strong></span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><b>Haiti</b> officially the <b>Republic of Haiti</b> is a country located on the island of Hispaniola in the Greater Antilles archipelago of the Caribbean Sea, to the east of Cuba and Jamaica and south of The Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. It occupies the western three-eighths of the island which it shares with the Dominican Republic. To its south-west lies the small Navassa Island, which is claimed by Haiti but is disputed as a United States territory under federal administration. Haiti is 27,750 km<sup>2</sup> (10,714 sq mi) in size, the third largest country in the Caribbean by area, and has an estimated population of 11.4 million, making it the most populous country in the Caribbean. The capital is Port-au-Prince.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">The island was originally inhabited by the indigenous Taíno people, who originated in South America. The first Europeans arrived on 5 December 1492 during the first voyage of Christopher Columbus, who initially believed he had found India or China. Columbus subsequently founded the first European settlement in the Americas, La Navidad, on what is now the northeastern coast of Haiti. The island was claimed by Spain and named <span title="Spanish-language text"><i lang="es">La Española</i></span>, forming part of the Spanish Empire until the early 17th century. However, competing claims and settlements by the French-led to the western portion of the island being ceded to France in 1697, which was subsequently named <span title="French-language text"><i lang="fr">Saint-Domingue</i></span>. French colonists established lucrative sugarcane plantations, worked by vast numbers of slaves brought from Africa, which made the colony one of the richest in the world.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">In the midst of the French Revolution (1789–99), slaves and free people of color launched the Haitian Revolution (1791–1804), led by a former slave and the first black general of the French Army, Toussaint Louverture. After 12 years of conflict, Napoleon Bonaparte’s forces were defeated by Louverture’s successor, Jean-Jacques Dessalines (later Emperor Jacques I), who declared Haiti’s sovereignty on 1 January 1804—the first independent nation of Latin America and the Caribbean, the second republic in the Americas, the first country in the Americas to abolish slavery, and the only state in history established by a successful slave revolt. Apart from Alexandre Pétion, the first President of the Republic, all of Haiti’s first leaders were former slaves. After a brief period in which the country was split in two, President Jean-Pierre Boyer united the country and then attempted to bring the whole of Hispaniola under Haitian control, precipitating a long series of wars that ended in the 1870s when Haiti formally recognized the independence of the Dominican Republic.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">Haiti’s first century of independence was characterized by political instability, ostracism by the international community, and the payment of crippling debt to France. Political volatility and foreign economic influence in the country prompted the U.S. to occupy the country from 1915 to 1934. Following a series of short-lived presidencies, François ‘Papa Doc’ Duvalier took power in 1956, ushering in a long period of autocratic rule continued by his son, Jean-Claude ‘Baby Doc’ Duvalier, that lasted until 1986; the period was characterized by state-sanctioned violence against the opposition and civilians, corruption, and economic stagnation. After 1986, Haiti began attempting to establish a more democratic political system.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">Historically poor and politically unstable, Haiti has the lowest Human Development Index in the Americas. Since the turn of the 21st century, the country has endured a coup d’état, which prompted U.N. intervention, as well as a catastrophic earthquake that killed over 250,000 people.</span></p> <p><span class="acss8af2a"><i>Haiti</i> (also earlier <i>Hayti</i>) comes from the indigenous Taíno language, in which it means “land of high mountains” and named the entire island of Hispaniola. The name was restored by Haitian revolutionary Jean-Jacques Dessalines as the official name of independent Saint-Domingue, as a tribute to the Amerindian predecessors.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">In French, Haiti’s nickname means the “Pearl of the Antilles” (<i>La Perle des Antilles</i>) because of both its natural beauty and the amount of wealth it accumulated for the Kingdom of France. During the 18th century the colony was the world’s leading producer of sugar and coffee.</span></p> <p><span class="acss8af2a"><strong>HISTORY </strong></span><br>

<span class="acss8af2a">The five caciquedoms of Hispaniola at the time of the arrival of Christopher Columbus</span></p> <p><span class="acss8af2a">The island of Hispaniola, of which Haiti occupies the western three-eighths, has been inhabited since about 5000 BC by groups of Native Americans thought to have arrived from Central or South America. Genetic studies show that some of these groups were related to the Yanomami of the Amazon Basin. Amongst these early settlers were the Ciboney peoples, followed by the Taíno, speakers of an Arawakan language, elements of which have been preserved in Haitian Creole. The Taíno name for the entire island was <i>Haiti</i>, or alternatively <i>Quisqeya</i>.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">In Taíno society the largest unit of political organization was led by a <i>cacique,</i> or chief, as the Europeans understood them. The island of Hispaniola was divided into five ‘caciquedoms’: the Magua in the northeast, the Marien in the northwest, the Jaragua in the southwest, the Maguana in the central regions of Cibao, and the Higüey in the southeast.<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><br>
</sup>Taíno cultural artifacts include cave paintings in several locations in the country. These have become national symbols of Haiti and tourist attractions. Modern-day Léogâne, started as a French colonial town in the southwest, is beside the former capital of the caciquedom of <i>Xaragua.</i><sup id="cite_ref-royal_50-0" class="reference"><br>
</sup><strong><span id="Colonial_era" class="mw-headline">Colonial era<br>
</span><span id="Spanish_rule_.281492.E2.80.931625.29"></span><span id="Spanish_rule_(1492–1625)" class="mw-headline">Spanish rule (1492–1625). </span></strong>Navigator Christopher Columbus landed in Haiti on 6 December 1492, in an area that he named <i>Môle-Saint-Nicolas,</i><sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference">[48]</sup> and claimed the island for the Crown of Castile. Nineteen days later, his ship the <i>Santa María</i> ran aground near the present site of Cap-Haïtien. Columbus left 39 men on the island, who founded the settlement of La Navidad on 25 December 1492. Relations with the native peoples, initially good, broke down and the settlers were later killed by the Taíno.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><sup id="cite_ref-Bradt10_52-0" class="reference"></sup>The sailors carried endemic Eurasian infectious diseases to which the native peoples lacked immunity, causing them to die in great numbers in epidemics. The first recorded smallpox epidemic in the Americas erupted on Hispaniola in 1507. Their numbers were further reduced by the harshness of the <i><span title="Spanish-language text"><i lang="es">encomienda</i></span></i> system, in which the Spanish forced natives to work in gold mines and plantations.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">The Spanish passed the Laws of Burgos (1512–1513), which forbade the maltreatment of natives, endorsed their conversion to Catholicism, and gave legal framework to <i><span title="Spanish-language text"><i lang="es">encomiendas</i></span>.</i> The natives were brought to these sites to work in specific plantations or industries.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">As the Spanish re-focused their colonization efforts on the greater riches of mainland Central and South America, Hispaniola became reduced largely to a trading and refueling post. As a result, piracy became widespread, encouraged by European powers hostile to Spain such as France (based on Île de la Tortue) and England. The Spanish largely abandoned the western third of the island, focusing their colonization effort on the eastern two-thirds. The western part of the island was thus gradually settled by French buccaneers; among them was Bertrand d’Ogeron, who succeeded in growing tobacco and recruited many French colonial families from Martinique and Guadeloupe. In 1697 France and Spain settled their hostilities on the island by way of the Treaty of Ryswick of 1697, which divided Hispaniola between them.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><span id="French_rule_.281625.E2.80.931804.29"></span><strong><span id="French_rule_(1625–1804)" class="mw-headline">French rule (1625–1804). </span></strong>France received the western third and subsequently named it Saint-Domingue, the French equivalent of <i>Santo Domingo</i>, the Spanish colony on Hispaniola. The French set about creating sugar and coffee plantations, worked by vast numbers of slaves imported from Africa, and Saint-Domingue grew to become their richest colonial possession.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">The French settlers were outnumbered by slaves by almost 10 to 1.<sup id="cite_ref-Bradt11_61-2" class="reference">[58]</sup> According to the 1788 Census, Haiti’s population consisted of nearly 25,000 Europeans, 22,000 free coloreds and 700,000 African slaves. In contrast, by 1763 the white population of French Canada, a far larger territory, had numbered only 65,000. In the north of the island, slaves were able to retain many ties to African cultures, religion, and language; these ties were continually being renewed by newly imported Africans. Some West African slaves held on to their traditional Vodou beliefs by secretly syncretizing them with Catholicism.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">The French enacted the <i>Code Noir</i> (“Black Code”), prepared by Jean-Baptiste Colbert and ratified by Louis XIV, which established rules on slave treatment and permissible freedoms. Saint-Domingue has been described as one of the most brutally efficient slave colonies; one-third of newly imported Africans died within a few years. Many slaves died from diseases such as smallpox and typhoid fever. They had low birth rates, and there is evidence that some women aborted fetuses rather than give birth to children within the bonds of slavery. The colony’s environment also suffered, as forests were cleared to make way for plantations and the land was overworked so as to extract maximum profit for French plantation owners.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><sup id="cite_ref-Encylopedia_Britannica_-_Haiti_21-7" class="reference"></sup>As in its Louisiana colony, the French colonial government allowed some rights to free people of color (<i>gens de couleur</i>), the mixed-race descendants of European male colonists and African female slaves (and later, mixed-race women). Over time, many were released from slavery and they established a separate social class. White French Creole fathers frequently sent their mixed-race sons to France for their education. Some men of color were admitted into the military. More of the free people of color lived in the south of the island, near Port-au-Prince, and many intermarried within their community. They frequently worked as artisans and tradesmen, and began to own some property, including slaves of their own. The free people of color petitioned the colonial government to expand their rights.<sup id="cite_ref-Bradt11_61-6" class="reference"><br>
</sup>The brutality of slave life led many slaves to escape to mountainous regions, where they set up their own autonomous communities and became known as Maroons. One Maroon leader, François Mackandal, led a rebellion in the 1750s, however, he was later captured and executed by the French.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><span id="Haitian_Revolution_.281791.E2.80.931804.29"></span><span id="Haitian_Revolution_(1791–1804)" class="mw-headline"><strong>Haitian Revolution (1791–1804).</strong> </span>Inspired by the French Revolution of 1789 and principles of the rights of man, the French settlers and free people of color pressed for greater political freedom and more civil rights. Tensions between these two groups led to conflict, as a militia of free-coloreds was set up in 1790 by Vincent Ogé, resulting in his capture, torture and execution. Sensing an opportunity, in August 1791 the first slave armies were established in northern Haiti under the leadership of Toussaint Louverture inspired by the Vodou <i>houngan</i> (priest) Boukman, and backed by the Spanish in Santo Domingo – soon a full-blown slave rebellion had broken out across the entire colony.<sup id="cite_ref-Encylopedia_Britannica_-_Haiti_21-11" class="reference"><br>
</sup>In 1792, the French government sent three commissioners with troops to re-establish control; to build an alliance with the <i>gens de couleur</i> and slaves commissioners Léger-Félicité Sonthonax and Étienne Polverel abolished slavery in the colony. Six months later, the National Convention, led by Maximilien de Robespierre and the Jacobins, endorsed abolition and extended it to all the French colonies.<sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference"><br>
</sup>The United States, which was a new republic itself, oscillated between supporting or not supporting Toussaint Louverture and the emerging country of Haiti, depending on who was President of the US. Washington, who was a slave holder and isolationist, kept the United States neutral, although private US citizens at times provided aid to French planters trying to put down the revolt. John Adams, a vocal opponent of slavery, fully supported the slave revolt by providing diplomatic recognition, financial support, munitions and warships (including the USS Constitution) beginning in 1798. This support ended in 1801 when Jefferson, another slave-holding president, took office and recalled the US Navy.<sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><br>
</sup>With slavery abolished, Toussaint Louverture pledged allegiance to France, and he fought off the British and Spanish forces who had taken advantage of the situation and invaded Saint-Domingue. The Spanish were later forced to cede their part of the island to France under the terms of the Peace of Basel in 1795, uniting the island under one government. However an insurgency against French rule broke out in the east, and in the west, there was fighting between Louverture’s forces and the free people of color-led by André Rigaud in the War of the Knives (1799–1800). Many surviving free people of color left the island as refugees.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">After Louverture created a separatist constitution and proclaimed himself governor-general for life, Napoléon Bonaparte in 1802 sent an expedition of 20,000 soldiers and as many sailors<sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference">[75]</sup> under the command of his brother-in-law, Charles Leclerc, to reassert French control. The French achieved some victories, but within a few months most of their army had died from yellow fever. Ultimately more than 50,000 French troops died in an attempt to retake the colony, including 18 generals. The French managed to capture Louverture, transporting him to France for trial. He was imprisoned at Fort de Joux, where he died in 1803 of exposure and possibly tuberculosis.<sup id="cite_ref-Farmer-LROB_66-1" class="reference"><br>
</sup>The slaves, along with free <i>gens de couleur</i> and allies, continued their fight for independence, led by generals Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Alexandre Pétion and Henry Christophe. The rebels finally managed to decisively defeat the French troops at the Battle of Vertières on 18 November 1803, establishing the first nation ever to successfully gain independence through a slave revolt. Under the overall command of Dessalines, the Haitian armies avoided open battle, and instead conducted a successful guerrilla campaign against the Napoleonic forces, working with diseases such as yellow fever to reduce the numbers of French soldiers. Later that year France withdrew its remaining 7,000 troops from the island and Napoleon gave up his idea of re-establishing a North American empire, selling Louisiana (New France) to the United States, in the Louisiana Purchase. It has been estimated that between 24,000 and 100,000 Europeans, and between 100,000 and 350,000 Haitian ex-slaves, died in the revolution. In the process, Dessalines became arguably the most successful military commander in the struggle against Napoleonic France.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><strong><span id="Independent_Haiti" class="mw-headline">Independent Haiti<br>

</sup>Fearful of the potential impact the slave rebellion could have in the slave states, U.S. President Thomas Jefferson refused to recognize the new republic. The Southern politicians who were a powerful voting bloc in the American Congress prevented U.S. recognition for decades until they withdrew in 1861 to form the Confederacy.<sup id="cite_ref-93" class="reference"><br>
</sup>The revolution led to a wave of emigration. In 1809, 9,000 refugees from Saint-Domingue, both white planters and people of color, settled <i>en masse</i> in New Orleans, doubling the city’s population, having been expelled from their initial refuge in Cuba by Spanish authorities. In addition, the newly arrived slaves added to the city’s African population.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">The plantation system was reestablished in Haiti, albeit for wages, however many Haitians were marginalized and resented the heavy-handed manner in which this was enforced in the new nation’s politics. The rebel movement splintered, and Dessalines was assassinated by rivals on 17 October 1806.<sup id="cite_ref-Haiti_97-0" class="reference"><br>

</sup>After Dessalines’ death, Haiti became split into two, with the Kingdom of Haiti in the north directed by Henri Christophe, later declaring himself Henri I, and a republic in the south centered on Port-au-Prince, directed by Alexandre Pétion, an <i>homme de couleur</i>. Christophe established a semi-feudal corvée system, with a rigid education and economic code. Pétion’s republic was less absolutist, and he initiated a series of land reforms which benefited the peasant class. President Pétion also gave military and financial assistance to the revolutionary leader Simón Bolívar, which were critical in enabling him to liberate the Viceroyalty of New Granada. Meanwhile, the French, who had managed to maintain a precarious control of eastern Hispaniola, were defeated by insurgents led by Juan Sánchez Ramírez, with the area returning to Spanish rule in 1809 following the Battle of Palo Hincado.</span><br>

</sup>Struggling to revive the agricultural economy to produce commodity crops, Boyer passed the Code Rural, which denied peasant laborers the right to leave the land, enter the towns, or start farms or shops of their own, causing much resentment as most peasants wished to have their own farms rather than work on plantations.<sup id="cite_ref-108" class="reference"><br>
</sup>Starting in September 1824, more than 6,000 African Americans migrated to Haiti, with transportation paid by an American philanthropic group similar in function to the American Colonization Society and its efforts in Liberia. Many found the conditions too harsh and returned to the United States.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">In July 1825, King Charles X of France, during a period of restoration of the French monarchy, sent a fleet to reconquer Haiti. Under pressure, President Boyer agreed to a treaty by which France formally recognized the independence of the nation in exchange for a payment of 150 million francs. By an order of 17 April 1826, the King of France renounced his rights of sovereignty and formally recognized the independence of Haiti.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">The enforced payments to France hampered Haiti’s economic growth for years, exacerbated by the fact that many Western nations continued to refuse formal diplomatic recognition to Haiti; Britain recognized Haitian independence in 1833, and the United States not until 1862. Haiti borrowed heavily from Western banks at extremely high interest rates to repay the debt. Although the amount of the reparations was reduced to 90 million in 1838, by 1900 80% of Haiti’s government spending was debt repayment and the country did not finish repaying it until 1947.<sup id="cite_ref-114" class="reference"><br>

In March Rivière-Hérard attempted to reimpose his authority, but the Dominicans put up stiff opposition and inflicted heavy losses. Rivière-Hérard was removed from office by the mulatto hierarchy and replaced with the aged general Philippe Guerrier, who assumed the presidency on 3 May 1844.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">Guerrier died in April 1845, and was succeeded by General Jean-Louis Pierrot. Pierrot’s most pressing duty as the new president was to check the incursions of the Dominicans, who were harassing the Haitian troops. Dominican gunboats were also making depredations on Haiti’s coasts. President Pierrot decided to open a campaign against the Dominicans, whom he considered merely as insurgents, however the Haitian offensive of 1845 was stopped on the frontier.<sup id="cite_ref-Bethell_116-1" class="reference"><br>

Soulouque pressed on, capturing San Juan. This left only the town of Azua as the remaining Dominican stronghold between the Haitian army and the capital. On 6 April, Azua fell to the 18,000-strong Haitian army, with a 5,000-man Dominican counterattack failing to oust them. The way to Santo Domingo was now clear. But the news of discontent existing at Port-au-Prince, which reached Soulouque, arrested his further progress and caused him to return with the army to his capital.<sup id="cite_ref-Jacques_118-0" class="reference"><br>

Their flotilla went as far as Dame-Marie, which they plundered and set on fire.<sup id="cite_ref-Jacques_118-1" class="reference">[115]</sup> Soulouque, now self-proclaimed as Emperor Faustin I, decided to start a new campaign against them. In 1855, he again invaded the territory of the Dominican Republic. But owing to insufficient preparation, the army was soon in want of victuals and ammunition. In spite of the bravery of the soldiers, the Emperor had once more to give up the idea of a unified island under Haitian control. After this campaign, Britain and France intervened and obtained an armistice on behalf of the Dominicans, who declared independence as the Dominican Republic.<sup id="cite_ref-Jacques_118-4" class="reference"><br>
</sup>The sufferings endured by the soldiers during the campaign of 1855, and the losses and sacrifices inflicted on the country without yielding any compensation or any practical results provoked great discontent.<sup id="cite_ref-Jacques_118-5" class="reference">[115]</sup> In 1858 a revolution began, led by General Fabre Geffrard, Duke of Tabara. In December of that year, Geffrard defeated the Imperial Army and seized control of most of the country. As a result, the Emperor abdicated his throne on 15 January 1859. Refused aid by the French Legation, Faustin was taken into exile aboard a British warship on 22 January 1859, and General Geffrard succeeded him as president.</span><br>

President Geffrard was overthrown in a coup in 1867, as was his successor, Sylvain Salnave, in 1869. Under the Presidency of Michel Domingue (1874–76) relations with the Dominican Republic were dramatically improved by the signing of a treaty, in which both parties acknowledged the independence of the other, bringing an end to Haitian dreams of bringing the entirety of Hispaniola under their control. Some modernisation of the economy and infrastructure also occurred in this period, especially under the Presidencies of Lysius Salomon (1879–88) and Florvil Hyppolite (1889–96).<sup id="cite_ref-121" class="reference"><br>
</sup>Haiti’s relations with outside powers were often strained. In 1889 the United States attempted to force Haiti to permit the building of a naval base at Môle Saint-Nicolas, which was firmly resisted by President Hyppolite. In 1892 the German government supported suppression of the reform movement of Anténor Firmin, and in 1897, the Germans used gunboat diplomacy to intimidate and then humiliate the Haitian government of President Tirésias Simon Sam (1896–1902) during the Lüders Affair.<sup id="cite_ref-123" class="reference"><br>
</sup>In the first decades of the 20th century, Haiti experienced great political instability and was heavily in debt to France, Germany and the United States. A series of short lived presidencies came and went: President Pierre Nord Alexis was forced from power in 1908, as was his successor François C. Antoine Simon in 1911; President Cincinnatus Leconte (1911–12) was killed in a (possibly deliberate) explosion at the National Palace; Michel Oreste (1913–14) was ousted in a coup, as was his successor Oreste Zamor in 1914.<sup id="cite_ref-128" class="reference"><br>
</sup><span id="United_States_occupation_(1915–1934)" class="mw-headline"><strong>United States occupation (1915–1934).</strong> </span>Germany increased its influence in Haiti in this period, with a small community of German settlers wielding disproportionate influence in Haiti’s economy. The German influence prompted anxieties in the United States, who had also invested heavily in the country, and whose government defended their right to oppose foreign interference in the Americas under the Monroe Doctrine.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">In December 1914, the Americans removed $500,000 from the Haitian National Bank, but rather than seize it to help pay the debt, it was removed for safe-keeping in New York, thus giving the United States control of the bank and preventing other powers from doing so. This gave a stable financial base on which to build the economy, and so enable the debt to be repaid.<sup id="cite_ref-131" class="reference"><br>
</sup>In 1915, Haiti’s new President Vilbrun Guillaume Sam sought to strengthen his tenuous rule by a mass execution of 167 political prisoners. Outrage at the killings led to riots, and Sam was captured and killed by a lynch mob. Fearing possible foreign intervention, or the emergence of a new government led by the anti-American Haitian politician Rosalvo Bobo, President Woodrow Wilson sent U.S. Marines into Haiti in July 1915. The USS <i>Washington</i>, under Rear Admiral Caperton, arrived in Port-au-Prince in an attempt to restore order and protect U.S. interests. Within days, the Marines had taken control of the capital city and its banks and customs house. The Marines declared martial law and severely censored the press. Within weeks, a new pro-U.S. Haitian president, Philippe Sudré Dartiguenave, was installed and a new constitution written that was favorable to the interests of the United States. The constitution (written by future US President Franklin D. Roosevelt) included a clause that allowed, for the first time, foreign ownership of land in Haiti, which was bitterly opposed by the Haitian legislature and citizenry.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><sup id="cite_ref-Bradt15_130-3" class="reference"></sup>The occupation improved some of Haiti’s infrastructure and centralized power in Port-au-Prince. 1700 km of roads were made usable, 189 bridges were built, many irrigation canals were rehabilitated, hospitals, schools, and public buildings were constructed, and drinking water was brought to the main cities. Port-au-Prince became the first Caribbean city to have a phone service with automatic dialling. Agricultural education was organized, with a central school of agriculture and 69 farms in the country. However, many infrastructure projects were built using the corvée system that allowed the government/occupying forces to take people from their homes and farms, at gunpoint if necessary, to build roads, bridges etc. by force, a process that was deeply resented by ordinary Haitians. Sisal was also introduced to Haiti, and sugarcane and cotton became significant exports, boosting prosperity. Haitian traditionalists, based in rural areas, were highly resistant to U.S.-backed changes, while the urban elites, typically mixed-race, welcomed the growing economy, but wanted more political control. Together they helped secure an end to the occupation in 1934, under the Presidency of Sténio Vincent (1930–41). The debts were still outstanding, though less due to increased prosperity, and the U.S. financial advisor-general receiver handled the budget until 1941.<sup id="cite_ref-138" class="reference"><br>
</sup>The U.S. Marines were instilled with a special brand of paternalism towards Haitians “expressed in the metaphor of a father’s relationship with his children.” Armed opposition to the US presence was led by the cacos under the command of Charlemagne Péralte; his capture and execution in 1919 earned him the status of a national martyr. During Senate hearings in 1921, the commandant of the Marine Corps reported that, in the 20 months of active unrest, 2,250 Haitians had been killed. However, in a report to the Secretary of the Navy, he reported the death toll as being 3,250. Haitian historians have claimed the true number was much higher, but this is not supported by most historians outside Haiti. Recognition of the distinctive traditionalism of the Haitian people had an influence on American writers, including Eugene O’Neill, James Weldon Johnson, Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston and Orson Welles.</span><br>

<span class="acss8af2a">Firmly anti-Communist, he was supported by the United States; with greater political stability tourists started to visit Haiti. The waterfront area of Port-au-Prince was redeveloped to allow cruise ship passengers to walk from the docks to cultural attractions.

</sup><span id="Duvalier_dynasty_(1957–1986)" class="mw-headline"><strong>Duvalier dynasty (1957–1986).</strong> </span>In 1956–57 Haiti underwent severe political turmoil; Magloire was forced to resign and leave the country in 1956 and he was followed by four short-lived presidencies. In the September 1957 election Dr. François Duvalier was elected President of Haiti. Known as ‘Papa Doc’ and initially popular, Duvalier remained President until his death in 1971. He advanced black interests in the public sector, where over time, people of color had predominated as the educated urban elite. Not trusting the army, despite his frequent purges of officers deemed disloyal, Duvalier created a private militia known as <i>Tontons Macoutes</i> (“Bogeymen”), which maintained order by terrorizing the populace and political opponents. In 1964 Duvalier proclaimed himself ‘President for Life’; an uprising against his rule that year in Jérémie was violently suppressed, with the ringleaders publicly executed and hundreds of mixed-raced citizens in the town killed. The bulk of the educated and professional class began leaving the country, and corruption became widespread. Duvalier sought to create a personality cult, identifying himself with Baron Samedi, one of the loa (or <i>lwa</i>), or spirits, of Haitian Vodou. Despite the well-publicized abuses under his rule, Duvalier’s firm anti-Communism earned him the support of the Americans, who furnished the country with aid.<sup id="cite_ref-Bradt17_157-4" class="reference"><br>
</sup>In 1971 Duvalier died, and he was succeeded by his son Jean-Claude Duvalier, nicknamed ‘Baby Doc’, who ruled until 1986. He largely continued his father’s policies, though curbed some of the worst excesses in order to court international respectability. Tourism, which had nosedived in Papa Doc’s time, again became a growing industry. However as the economy continued to decline Baby Doc’s grip on power began to weaken. Haiti’s pig population was slaughtered following an outbreak of swine fever in the late 1970s, causing hardship to rural communities who used them as an investment. The opposition became more vocal, bolstered by a visit to the country by Pope John Paul II in 1983, who publicly lambasted the president. Demonstrations occurred in Gonaïves in 1985 which then spread across the country; under pressure from the United States, Duvalier left the country for France in February 1986.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">In total, roughly 40,000 to 60,000 Haitians are estimated to have been killed during the reign of the Duvaliers. Through the use of his intimidation tactics and executions, many intellectual Haitians had fled, leaving the country with a massive brain-drain that it has yet to recover from.<sup id="cite_ref-165" class="reference"><br>

In subsequent years, there was increasing violence between rival political factions and human rights abuses. Aristide spent years negotiating with the Convergence Démocratique on new elections, but the Convergence’s inability to develop a sufficient electoral base made elections unattractive.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">In 2004 an anti-Aristide revolt began in northern Haiti. The rebellion eventually reached the capital, and Aristide was forced into exile. The precise nature of the events are disputed; some, including Aristide and his bodyguard, Franz Gabriel, stated that he was the victim of a “new coup d’état or modern kidnapping” by U.S. forces. Mrs. Aristide stated that the kidnappers wore U.S. Special Forces uniforms, but changed into civilian clothes upon boarding the aircraft that was used to remove Aristide from Haiti. These charges were denied by the US government. As political violence and crime continued to grow, a United Nations Stabilisation Mission (MINUSTAH) was brought in to maintain order. However MINUSTAH proved controversial, as their at times heavy-handed approach to maintaining law and order and several instances of abuses, including the alleged sexual abuse of civilians, provoked resentment and distrust amongst ordinary Haitian. Boniface Alexandre assumed interim authority until 2006, when René Préval was re-elected President following elections.<sup id="cite_ref-Bradt20_186-1" class="reference"><br>

The run-off between Michel Martelly and Mirlande Manigat took place on 20 March 2011, and preliminary results, released on 4 April, named Michel Martelly the winner. In 2011 both former dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier and Jean-Bertrand Aristide returned to Haiti; attempts to try Duvalier for crimes committed under his rule were shelved following his death in 2014. In 2013, Haiti called for European nations to pay reparations for slavery and establish an official commission for the settlement of past wrongdoings. Meanwhile, after continuing political wrangling with the opposition and allegations of electoral fraud, Martelly agreed to step down in 2016 without a successor in place. An interim president, Jocelerme Privert, then took office. After numerous postponements, partly owing to the effects of devastating Hurricane Matthew, elections were eventually held in November 2016. The victor, Jovenel Moïse of the Haitian Tèt Kale Party, was subsequently sworn in as president in 2017. The 2018–2021 Haitian protests are demonstrations in cities throughout Haiti that began on 7 July 2018, in response to increased fuel prices. Over time these protests evolved into demands for the resignation of president Moïse.<sup id="cite_ref-212" class="reference"><br>
</sup>On 7 July 2021, President Moïse was assassinated in an attack on his private residence, and First Lady Martine Moïse was hospitalized following the overnight attack. The United Nations special envoy for Haiti, Helen La Lime, said on 8 July 2021 that interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph, as Acting President, will lead Haiti until an election is held later in the year, urging all parties to set aside differences. Claude Joseph’s presidency is disputed with Senate Leader Joseph Lambert. The United Nations recognized Claude Joseph as the legitimate Acting President. Haitian officials have asked the United States to send troops to help stabilize the country and protect vital infrastructure.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">On 19 July 2021, Claude Joseph stepped down as Acting President, transferring the power to rival Ariel Henry.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">In August 2021, Haiti suffered a huge earthquake, with many casualties. The earthquake has also damaged Haiti’s economic conditions and led to a rise in violent crimes in the country.</span></p> <p><span class="acss8af2a"><strong>GEOGRAPHY<br>

<span class="acss8af2a">Port-au-Prince receives an average annual rainfall of 1,370 mm (53.9 in). There are two rainy seasons, April–June and October–November.

</sup><strong><span id="Geology" class="mw-headline">Geology. </span></strong>There are blind thrust faults associated with the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault system over which Haiti lies. After the earthquake of 2010, there was no evidence of surface rupture and geologists’ findings were based on seismological, geological and ground deformation data.<sup id="cite_ref-Hayes_228-0" class="reference"><br>
</sup>The northern boundary of the fault is where the Caribbean tectonic plate shifts eastwards by about 20 mm (0.79 inches) per year in relation to the North American plate. The strike-slip fault system in the region has two branches in Haiti, the Septentrional-Oriente fault in the north and the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault in the south.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">A 2007 earthquake hazard study, noted that the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone could be at the end of its seismic cycle and concluded that a worst-case forecast would involve a 7.2 M<sub>w</sub> earthquake, similar in size to the 1692 Jamaica earthquake.<sup id="cite_ref-DeMets_229-0" class="reference">[226]</sup> A study team presented a hazard assessment of the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault system to the 18th Caribbean Geologic Conference in March 2008, noting the large strain.

<span class="acss8af2a">Haiti’s border with the Dominican Republic in 2002, showing the extent of deforestation on the Haitian side (left)<br>
The soil erosion released from the upper catchments and deforestation has caused periodic and severe flooding in Haiti, as experienced, for example, on 17 September 2004. Earlier in May that year, floods had killed over 3,000 people on Haiti’s southern border with the Dominican Republic.<sup id="cite_ref-233" class="reference"><br>
</sup>Haiti’s forests covered 60% of the country as recently as 50 years ago, but that has been halved to a current estimate of 30% tree cover, according to a more recent environmental analysis. This estimate poses a stark difference from the erroneous figure of 2% which has been oft-cited in discourse concerning the country’s environmental condition. Haiti had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.01/10, ranking it 137th globally out of 172 countries.<sup id="cite_ref-FLII-Supplementary_235-0" class="reference"><br>

<span class="acss8af2a"><sup id="cite_ref-236" class="reference"></sup><span id="Biodiversity" class="mw-headline">Biodiversity. </span>Haiti is home to four ecoregions: Hispaniolan moist forests, Hispaniolan dry forests, Hispaniolan pine forests, and Greater Antilles mangroves.<sup id="cite_ref-DinersteinOlson2017_237-0" class="reference">[234]<br>
</sup>Despite its small size, Haiti’s mountainous terrain and resultant multiple climatic zones has resulted in a wide variety of plant life. Notable tree species include the breadfruit tree, mango tree, acacia, mahogany, coconut palm, royal palm, and West Indian cedar. The forests were formerly much more extensive, but have been subject to severe deforestation.<sup id="cite_ref-Encylopedia_Britannica_-_Haiti_21-51" class="reference"><br>

</sup>Haiti has consistently ranked among the most corrupt countries in the world on the Corruption Perceptions Index. According to a 2006 report by the Corruption Perceptions Index, there is a strong correlation between corruption and poverty in Haiti. The nation ranked first of all countries surveyed for levels of perceived domestic corruption. It is estimated that President “Baby Doc” Duvalier, his wife Michelle, and their agents stole US $504 million from the country’s treasury between 1971 and 1986. Similarly, after the Haitian Army folded in 1995, the Haitian National Police (HNP) gained sole power of authority over the Haitian citizens. Many Haitians as well as observers of Haitian society believe that this monopolized power could have given way to a corrupt police force.<sup id="cite_ref-Haiti:_Police_and_Law_Enforcement_256-0" class="reference"><br>
</sup>Similarly, some media outlets alleged that millions were stolen by former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide. In March 2004, at the time of Aristide’s kidnapping, a BBC article wrote that the Bush administration’s State Department stated that Aristide had been involved in drug trafficking. The BBC also described pyramid schemes, in which Haitians lost hundreds of millions in 2002, as the “only real economic initiative” of the Aristide years.<sup id="cite_ref-basketcase_262-0" class="reference"><br>
</sup>Conversely, according to the 2013 United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) report, murder rates in Haiti (10.2 per 100,000) are far <i>below</i> the regional average (26 per 100,000); less than <span class="sfrac tion" role="math"><span class="num">1</span><span class="sr-only">/</span><span class="den">4</span></span> that of Jamaica (39.3 per 100,000) and nearly <span class="sfrac tion" role="math"><span class="num">1</span><span class="sr-only">/</span><span class="den">2</span></span> that of the Dominican Republic (22.1 per 100,000), making it among the safer countries in the region. In large part, this is due to the country’s ability to fulfill a pledge by increasing its national police yearly by 50%, a four-year initiative that was started in 2012. In addition to the yearly recruits, the Haitian National Police (HNP) has been using innovative technologies to crack down on crime. A notable bust in recent years led to the dismantlement of the largest kidnapping ring in the country with the use of an advanced software program developed by a West Point-trained Haitian official that proved to be so effective that it has led to its foreign advisers to make inquiries.<sup id="cite_ref-265" class="reference"><br>
</sup>In 2010, the New York City Police Department (NYPD) sent a team of veteran officers to Haiti to assist in the rebuilding of its police force with special training in investigative techniques, strategies to improve the anti-kidnapping personnel, and community outreach to build stronger relationships with the public, especially among the youth. It has also helped the HNP set up a police unit in the center of Delmas, a neighborhood of Port-au-Prince.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><span id="Haitian_penitentiary_system" class="mw-headline"><strong>Haitian penitentiary system</strong>. </span>Port-au-Prince penitentiary is home to half of Haiti’s prisoners. The prison has a capacity of 1,200 detainees but as of November 2017, the penitentiary was obliged to keep 4,359 detainees, a 454% occupancy level.<sup id="cite_ref-auto_271-0" class="reference">[268]</sup> This leads to severe consequences for the inmates.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">One cell could hold up to 60 inmates which was originally designed for only 18, therefore creating tight and uncomfortable living conditions. The inmates are forced to create makeshift hammocks from the wall and ceilings. The men are on a 22/23-hour lock up in the cells so the risk of diseases is very high.<sup id="cite_ref-auto_271-1" class="reference">[268]</sup> The inability to receive sufficient funds from the government as Haiti endures severe natural disasters which take up their attention and resources, such as the 2010 earthquake, has caused deadly cases of malnutrition, combined with the tight living conditions, increases the risk of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis which has led to 21 deaths in January 2017 alone at the Port-au-Prince penitentiary.<sup id="cite_ref-auto_271-2" class="reference"><br>
</sup>Haitian law states that once arrested, one must go before a judge within 48 hours; however, this is very rare. In an interview with Unreported World, the prison governor stated that around 529 detainees were never sentenced, there are 3,830 detainees who are in prolonged detained trial detention. Therefore, 80% are not convicted.<sup id="cite_ref-272" class="reference">[269]<br>
</sup>Unless families are able to provide the necessary funds for inmates to appear before a judge there is a very slim chance the inmate would have a trial, on average, within 10 years. Brian Concannon, the director of the non-profit Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti, claims that without a substantial bribe to persuade judges, prosecutors, and lawyers to undergo their case, there is no prospect of getting a trial for years.<sup id="cite_ref-273" class="reference">[270]<br>
</sup>Families may send food to the penitentiary; however, most inmates depend on the meals served twice a day. However, the majority of the meals consist of ration supplies of rice, oats or cornmeal, which has led to deadly cases of malnutrition-related ailments such as beriberi and anemia. Prisoners too weak are crammed in the penitentiary infirmary.<sup id="cite_ref-prison_274-0" class="reference">[271]<br>
</sup>In confined living spaces for 22–23 hours a day, inmates are not provided with latrines and are forced to defecate into plastic bags and leave them outside their cells. These conditions were considered inhumane by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in 2008.</span></p> <p><span class="acss8af2a"><strong>ECONOMY </strong></span></p> <div class="thumb tright"> <div class="thumbinner"> <p><span class="acss8af2a"><amp-img data-hero class="thumbimage amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Economic_growth_of_Haiti.jpg/220px-Economic_growth_of_Haiti.jpg" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Economic_growth_of_Haiti.jpg/330px-Economic_growth_of_Haiti.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Economic_growth_of_Haiti.jpg/440px-Economic_growth_of_Haiti.jpg 2x" alt="" width="220" height="139" layout="intrinsic"><amp-img fallback data-hero class="thumbimage amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://www.ronperrier.net/wp-content/plugins/accelerated-mobile-pages/images/SD-default-image.png" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Economic_growth_of_Haiti.jpg/330px-Economic_growth_of_Haiti.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Economic_growth_of_Haiti.jpg/440px-Economic_growth_of_Haiti.jpg 2x" alt="" width="220" height="139" layout="intrinsic"></amp-img></amp-img></span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">Historical GDP per capita development</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">Haiti has a predominantly free market economy, with a GDP of $19.97 billion and per capita GDP of $1,800 (2017 estimates). The country uses the Haitian gourde as its currency. Despite its tourism industry, Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the Americas, with corruption, political instability, poor infrastructure, lack of health care and lack of education cited as the main causes. Unemployment is high and many Haitians seek to emigrate. Trade declined dramatically after the 2010 earthquake and subsequent outbreak of cholera, with the country’s purchasing power parity GDP falling by 8% (from US$12.15 billion to US$11.18 billion), Haiti ranked 145th of 182 countries in the 2010 United Nations Human Development Index, with 57.3% of the population being deprived in at least three of the HDI’s poverty measures.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">Following the disputed 2000 election and accusations about President Aristide’s rule, US aid to the Haitian government was cut off between 2001 and 2004. After Aristide’s departure in 2004, aid was restored and the Brazilian army led a United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti peacekeeping operation. After almost four years of recession, the economy grew by 1.5% in 2005. In September 2009, Haiti met the conditions set out by the IMF and World Bank’s Heavily Indebted Poor Countries program to qualify for the cancellation of its external debt.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">More than 90 percent of the government’s budget comes from an agreement with Petrocaribe, a Venezuela-led oil alliance.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><strong>Foreign aid.</strong> Haiti received more than US$4 billion in aid from 1990 to 2003, including US$1.5 billion from the United States. The largest donor is the US, followed by Canada and the European Union. In January 2010, following the earthquake, US President Barack Obama promised US$1.15 billion in assistance. European Union nations pledged more than €400 million (US$616 million). Neighboring Dominican Republic has also provided extensive humanitarian aid to Haiti, including the funding and construction of a public university, human capital, free healthcare services in the border region, and logistical support after the 2010 earthquake.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">The United Nations states that in total US$13.34 billion has been earmarked for post-earthquake reconstruction through 2020, though two years after the 2010 quake, less than half of that amount had actually been released, according to UN documents. As of 2015, the US government has allocated US$4 billion, US$3 billion has already been spent, and the rest is dedicated to longer-term projects.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a"><strong>Trade.</strong> According to the 2015 CIA World Factbook, Haiti’s main import partners are: Dominican Republic 35%, US 26.8%, Netherlands Antilles 8.7%, China 7% (est. 2013). Haiti’s main export partner is the US 83.5% (est. 2013). Haiti had a trade deficit of US$3 billion in 2011, or 41% of GDP.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">Energy. In 1925, the city of Jacmel was the first area in the Caribbean to have electricity and was subsequently dubbed the <i>City of Light.<br>
</i>Today, Haiti relies heavily on an oil alliance with Petrocaribe for much of its energy requirements. In recent years, hydroelectric, solar and wind energy have been explored as possible sustainable energy sources.</span><br>
<span class="acss8af2a">As of 2017, among all the countries in the Americas, Haiti is producing the least energy. Less than a quarter of the country has electric coverage. Most regions of Haiti that do have energy are powered by generators. These generators are often expensive and produce a lot of pollution. The areas that do get electricity experience power cuts on a daily basis, and some areas are limited to 12 hours of electricity a day. Electricity is provided by a small number of independent companies: Sogener, E-power, and Haytrac. There is no national electricity grid within the country. The most common source of energy used is wood, along with charcoal. In Haiti, about 4 million metric tons of wood products are consumed yearly. Like charcoal and wood, petroleum is also an important source of energy for Haiti. Since Haiti cannot produce its own fuel, all fuel is imported. Yearly, around 691,000 tons of oil is imported into the country.</span><br>

To meet this objective, 236 MW needs to installed in Port-au-Prince alone, with an additional 75 MW needed in all other regions in the country.

</span><span class="acss8af2a">The middle and upper classes live in suburbs, or in the central part of the bigger cities in apartments, where there is urban planning. Many of the houses they live in are like miniature fortresses, located behind walls embedded with metal spikes, barbed wire, broken glass, and sometimes all three. The gates to these houses are barred at night, the house is locked; guard dogs patrol the yard. These houses are often self-sufficient as well. The houses have backup generators because the electrical grid in Haiti is unreliable. Some even have rooftop reservoirs for water, as the water supply is also unreliable.<br>
