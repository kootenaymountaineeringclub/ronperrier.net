As the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, Haiti’s poverty is glaring. 75% make<br /> their living in the service economy. Everyone is out there eking out a living in some basic way: selling something &#8211; the street market in Cape Haitian is gigantic – occupying at least 3 X 10 blocks of streets, all impenetrable to vehicles as the lanes between stalls can only be walked. And the other market occupying a garbage tip on the beach is also large with different goods (used clothing, charcoal and produce). The average income is less than US$2/day. The paper money is filthy.<br /> 75% of people don’t have running water in their homes. Electricity is erratic, blackouts daily and generators are a must. Mosquitos are common at night due to all the standing water.<br /> <strong>2. People.</strong> Virtually everyone is black with few brown people. Shortly after independence in 1804, the president killed all the whites (over 3,000 people). You don’t see anyone who is fat. Most people look healthy but thin. No one smokes.<br /> Begging: non-existent in Cap Haitian, very common in Port-au-Prince.<br /> <strong>3. Garbage</strong> is devastating in Cap Haitian. I have never seen anything like it. One downtown half street was piled high. Old plastic bottles are black and flattened. The beach and water was covered in plastic. A market exists on a garbage tip on the beach. There is no attempt to clean it up.<br /> In PaP, it is much cleaner and comparable to India. I even saw a large garbage truck with 6 men removing a large pile near the main square. Some of it is smoking as they try to burn it.<br /> <strong>4. Safety.</strong> Cap Haitian is very safe, PaP is completely unsafe south of a few blocks from the main town square. One can’t drive anywhere there or along the coast to Jacmel (via Carreforre) without a 100% risk of carjacking or kidnapping. There are 160 gangs that control vast areas of south Haiti dealing in drugs, prostitution and kidnapping.<br /> <strong>5. Costs.</strong> It is cheap on the streets and using moto-taxis and tuk-tuks, but hotels and taxis are relatively expensive. Hotels have to provide their own electricity, water and armed guards to be able to provide security.</p><p><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"></sup><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>I took the Caribe Tours bus from Santo Domingo on March 28 (8 am, 1,750 DR + US$37 departure tax, 7 hours with all the immigration) to Cap Haitian, Haiti, in the north. We crossed the border at Ounaminthe-Dajabon. I stayed at Habitacion Des Lauiers (US$50/night),  a lovely hotel, a short steep walk above downtown. I think it is the best hotel in Cap Haitian as it is well run and has electricity all the time because of its two generators. Screens keep the mosquitos out. </em></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>The rooms were simple but very adequate. I stayed two nights and had great sleeps and didn&#8217;t need a fan. The mosquitos though are particularly well but I opened my door quickly to not let any in.<br /> </em><em>On the bus, I sat next to a lovely Mexican guy, Jaime who has also traveled extensively. He was a life-saver as he was organized. We had both arranged the same hotel and took a taxi arranged by the hotel, $10 each (very expensive) up to the hotel, even though it was only a 1.9 km walk uphill. </em></span></p><p><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">After a good breakfast, we walked down through town. Cap Haitian (compared to Port au Prince &#8211; PaP) is very safe with no kidnapping or crime.</span></em><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Our Lady of the Assumption Cathedral.</strong> This is a nice 3-nave church with wonderful wood ceilings in the nave, cross, and altar. We were shown around by two guys who were exuberant about their church. All the Ways of the Cross had been stolen. We gave them $5 for the great tour. They said there is a tunnel all the way from The Palace to under the altar was used by Henri Cristophe to get to the church. </span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>We then continued our walk through downtown to the Old Market (Pont Neuf Market), situated on the beach on top of a garbage dump. It is huge with sections devoted to clothes (all used Western clothes), charcoal, and food. The people hate having their photos taken so I only took a few of the wares. </em></span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>The garbage in OCap is devastating. An entire half street is full of it. It is everywhere especially on the beach. I have never seen anything remotely close in my previous 149 countries. Open sewers and a lot of standing water contribute to the mosquito problem.<br /> </em></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Citadel, Sans Souci, Ramiers World Heritage Site.</strong></span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><b>Palace of Sans-Souci</b> was the principal royal residence of Henry I, King of Haiti, better known as Henri Christophe. It is located in the town of Milot, approximately five km northeast of the Citadelle Laferrière, and thirteen km southwest of the Three Bays Protected Area.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The palace&#8217;s name, French for &#8220;carefree&#8221;, is shared with both Sanssouci, Frederick the Great&#8217;s palace in Potsdam, Germany, and with Haitian Revolution military leader Jean-Baptiste Sans Souci, who was executed by Henri Christophe in 1803. The palace was built between 1810-1813 by an undetermined number of workers.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The residence accommodated the king, his family, Queen Marie-Louise, and their children, along with their royal staff of advisors. It was the most important of nine palaces commissioned by the king, as well as fifteen châteaux, numerous forts, and sprawling summer homes on his twenty plantations. The nearest airport and large city is Cap-Haïtien.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Before the construction of Sans-Souci, Milot was a French plantation that Christophe managed for a period during the Haitian Revolution. Many of Henri Christophe&#8217;s contemporaries noted his ruthlessness, and it is unknown how many laborers died during the palace&#8217;s construction. Under his reign, the palace was the site of opulent feasts and dances. It had immense gardens, artificial springs, and a system of waterworks.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Though Sans-Souci is now an empty ruin, at the time its splendor was noted by many foreign visitors. One American physician remarked that it had &#8220;the reputation of having been one of the most magnificent edifices of the West Indies.&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><br /> </sup>Close to the Palace is the renowned mountaintop fortress; the Citadelle Laferrière, built under a decree by Henri Christophe to repel a feared French invasion that never occurred. It is reached by continuing on the trail behind the Palace.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Crippled by a stroke, then King Henri I committed suicide on the grounds of the palace on October 8, 1820. According to Haitian legend, he shot himself with a silver bullet. He was subsequently buried in the Citadelle. The gun is in the National Museum in PaP.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">His son and heir, Jacques-Victor Henry, Prince Royal of Haiti was bayoneted to death by revolutionaries at the Palace on October 18, 1820.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">A severe earthquake in 1842 destroyed a considerable part of the palace and devastated the nearby city of Cap-Haïtien; the palace was never rebuilt.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The palace shares its name with another Haitian revolutionary leader, Colonel Jean-Baptiste Sans Souci. He was an African slave who may have taken his name from the <i>quartier</i> near the parish of Grande Rivière where he first led troops in guerrilla fighting against the French in 1791. When Henri Christophe and other military leaders split from the French, they asked Sans Souci to join their ranks, but he declined and particularly viewed Christophe as a traitor. About ten years before the construction of his palace, the future Haitian king sent Colonel Sans Souci a conciliatory message inviting him to one of his headquarters at the main Grand Pré plantation, adjacent to the Milot plantation where he would later build the palace. When Sans Souci arrived, Christophe&#8217;s guards bayoneted him and his small band of guards to death. Sans Souci Palace was built only a few yards away, or perhaps even exactly over, the place where Sans Souci the man was killed by Christophe.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"></sup>Some scholars have also asked whether Christophe took part of his inspiration for the palace from the Prussian king Frederick the Great&#8217;s palace in Potsdam, Sanssouci, a symbol of European Enlightenment achievement. Other scholars argue, the palace&#8217;s architecture is inspired by the Boffrand&#8217;s designs for the Château de la Malgrange for Leopold, Duke of Lorraine, near Nancy.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">In any event, the palace&#8217; splendor was remarked upon by various visitors, generally acknowledged by many to be the Caribbean equivalent to the Palace of Versailles in France. Proud of its magnificence, the Palace of Sans-Souci was an important step in Henri Christophe&#8217;s plan to demonstrate to foreigners, particularly Europeans and Americans, the power and capability of the black race. The African pride in the construction of the king&#8217;s palace was captured by the comment of his advisor and architect, Pompée Valentin Vastey (Baron Valentin de Vastey), who said that the palace and its nearby church, &#8220;erected by descendants of Africans, show that we have not lost the architectural taste and genius of our ancestors who covered Ethiopia, Egypt, Carthage, and old Spain with their superb monuments.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">UNESCO designated it—and the Citadelle—World Heritage Sites in 1982. Described as &#8220;one of the most remarkable attractions in the Western Hemisphere&#8221;, the Palace of Sans-Souci is &#8220;seldom visited by foreigners&#8221; due to &#8220;decades of political instability and lawlessness&#8221; in Haiti.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>We had arranged a driver, the entrance, moto and horse at the hotel for $140 for both of us but decided it would be more fun, and much cheaper to do it alone. At the market we found a tuk-tuks to the Citadel and were offered anything from $100 to $20. Frandy Stolen (WatsApp +509 34152699) was a gem of a guy who drove us the 20 km to Milot, waited for us, and drove us back for $20.<br /> </em>The palace is in the town of Milot. We paid $10 each to enter (but in retrospect, I think there is no fee and the charge is for a guide). Jaime is a soft touch. Then the hard bargaining began. Starting at $100, we bargained him down to $40 for the moto, guide, and one horse. </span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The palace is a complete ruin. The stone/brick edifice is 3 stories but the floors and roof are all gone. The grounds have several other ruined buildings including a hospital and a pool.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><b>Citadelle Laferrière</b> (Citadelle Henri Christophe, or simply the Citadelle), is a large early 19th-century fortress situated on the Bonnet à l&#8217;Evêque mountaintop in Nord, Haiti.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"></sup> The imposing structure is located approximately 27 km south of the city of Cap-Haïtien, 15 km southwest of the Three Bays Protected Area, and 8 km uphill from the town of Milot. Commissioned by Haitian revolutionary Henri Christophe, and built by tens of thousands of former slaves,<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"></sup> the Citadelle was the linchpin of the newly independent Haiti&#8217;s defensive strategy against potential French incursion.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><sup id="cite_ref-auto_3-0" class="reference"></sup>Including several smaller forts across the country, the stronghold remains the only African-derived military fortification in the New World as well as the first example of African-derived colonial architecture; which it shares with Sans-Souci Palace, also commissioned by Christophe. Designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1982—along with the aforementioned Sans-Souci, the fortress is universally regarded as an icon of the Caribbean nation.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="thumbimage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_back_wall.jpg/300px-Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_back_wall.jpg" srcset="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_back_wall.jpg/450px-Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_back_wall.jpg 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_back_wall.jpg/600px-Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_back_wall.jpg 2x" alt="" width="300" height="225" data-file-width="2592" data-file-height="1944" /></span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Commissioned in 1805 by Henri Christophe and completed in 1820, the fortress was built as part of a system of fortifications designed to thwart potential foreign incursions; notably the French. During the stronghold&#8217;s conceptual phase, Christophe was a general in the Haitian army and chief administrator of the country&#8217;s northern regions. The ensuing power struggle he had with his rival and fellow revolutionary Alexandre Pétion, would result in his self-declaration as king of Northern Haiti in 1811.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Citadelle, constructed by over 20,000 ex-slaves, was built several kilometres inland atop the 900-metre (3,000 ft) Bonnet à l’Eveque mountain, as a means of providing the optimal military vantage point. The location enabled Haitian forces to strategically keep watch over a vast distance, from the nearby valleys to the coastline. Cap-Haïtien and the adjoining Atlantic Ocean are visible from the roof of the fortress. It is the largest fortress in Haiti and one of the largest in the New World; it continues to serve as a symbol of Haitian independence.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Haitians outfitted the fortress with 365 cannons of varying size, assembled from the abandoned munitions left behind by the European forces that formerly occupied the island. The enormous stockpiles of 8,000 cannonballs still sit in pyramidal stacks at the base of the fortress walls. Since its construction, the fortress has withstood numerous earthquakes, though a French attack never came and it was eventually abandoned.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the event of an invasion, Christophe planned to have his military burn the valuable crops and food stocks along the coast, then retreat to the fortress, setting ambushes along the sole mountain path leading to the Citadelle.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Christophe suffered a stroke in 1820, and some of his troops mutinied. Shortly afterwards, he committed suicide—according to legend, by shooting himself with a silver bullet. Loyal followers covered his body in quicklime and entombed it in one of the Citadelle&#8217;s interior courtyards to prevent others from mutilating the corpse.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"></sup>The colossal physical dimensions of the fortress have made it a Haitian national symbol, featured on currency, stamps, and tourist ministry posters. The fortress walls rise 40 metres (130 ft) from the mountaintop and the entire complex, including cannonball stocks but excluding the surrounding grounds, covers an area of 10,000 square metres (110,000 sq ft). Workers laid the large foundation stones of the fortress directly into the stone of the mountaintop, using a mortar mixture that included quicklime, molasses, and the blood of local cows and goats—and cows hooves that they cooked to a glue and added to the mix to give the mortar added strength and bonding power.<noscript><img decoding="async" class="thumbimage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_3.jpg/300px-Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_3.jpg" srcset="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_3.jpg/450px-Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_3.jpg 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_3.jpg 2x" alt="" width="300" height="195" data-file-width="496" data-file-height="323" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload thumbimage" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20300%20195%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_3.jpg/300px-Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_3.jpg" data-srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_3.jpg/450px-Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_3.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_3.jpg 2x" alt="" width="300" height="195" data-file-width="496" data-file-height="323" /></span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Cannonball stockpiles, viewed from the roof<br /> <noscript><img decoding="async" class="thumbimage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_Aerial_View.jpg/300px-Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_Aerial_View.jpg" srcset="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_Aerial_View.jpg/450px-Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_Aerial_View.jpg 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_Aerial_View.jpg/600px-Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_Aerial_View.jpg 2x" alt="" width="300" height="200" data-file-width="3022" data-file-height="2015" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload thumbimage" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20300%20200%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_Aerial_View.jpg/300px-Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_Aerial_View.jpg" data-srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_Aerial_View.jpg/450px-Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_Aerial_View.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_Aerial_View.jpg/600px-Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_Aerial_View.jpg 2x" alt="" width="300" height="200" data-file-width="3022" data-file-height="2015" /></span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Citadelle Laferrière aerial view from a US Army UH-60 Black Hawk during Operation Unified Response, after the 2010 Haiti Earthquake<br /> Large cisterns and storehouses in the fortress&#8217;s interior were designed to store enough food and water for 5,000 defenders for up to one year. The fortress included palace quarters for the king and his family, in the event that they needed to take refuge within its walls. Other facilities included dungeons, bathing quarters, and bakery ovens. Also visible is the tomb of Christophe&#8217;s brother-in-law, killed when the gunpowder room he was in exploded.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Citadelle&#8217;s appearance from the trail leading up to its base has been likened to the prow of a great stone ship, jutting out from the mountainside. The structure is angular and assumes different geometric forms based on the viewer&#8217;s orientation. Some of the angles on the Citadelle were intentionally put there by Christophe to deviate cannonballs if attacked and the Epaulette is a great example of using angles to deviate and deflect shots. Though most of the fortress has no roof as such (the interior top is a latticework of stone walkways), some slanted portions are adorned with bright red tiles. The fortress has been repaired and refurnished several times since its construction, including in the 1980s with help from UNESCO and the World Monuments Fund, though little of it has been replaced and its design remains the same.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Tourism. The Citadelle is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Haiti. Directions to and history of the fortress are provided by self-appointed guides from the town of Milot. Near the entrance to Sans-Souci Palace, which is at the start of the trail to the Citadelle, visitors may be asked to pay a small fee. Visitors are also encouraged to rent a horse for the uphill trek. The first portion of the 11 kilometre (7 mi) trail is navigable by 4WD vehicle, although infrequent landslides and construction projects sometimes make this unreliable. Numerous people live along the trail and sell souvenirs or drinks, such as fresh coconut juice, to travelers. Drinks are a necessity in the tropical heat. There were also &#8220;bamboo&#8221; players (a digerido-like instrument and a flute player.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The trail is paved stone, generally smooth and in good condition. About three-quarters of the way up from the parking lot, visitors must complete the final portion on horseback or on foot. The entire 11-kilometre (7 mi) trail, starting in Milot, is almost completely uphill, but can be walked by experienced hikers who carry plenty of water. Most of the interior of the Citadelle fortress itself is accessible to visitors, who may also climb the numerous staircases to the fortress&#8217;s roof, which is free of guardrails. On a clear day, the city of Cap-Haïtien and the Atlantic Ocean can be seen to the north. Because of its elevation the top of the Citadelle is used by United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) for a Radio repeater, with an antenna on the highest point.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Though the turbulent political situation in Haiti (principally in the central region) has deterred visitors in recent years, the regions of the north and south of the country remain largely peaceful, making travel to the Citadel less challenging or hazardous than travel within the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><noscript><img decoding="async" class="thumbimage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Les_Ramier%2C_citadelle_du_roi_Henri_Christophe.JPG/220px-Les_Ramier%2C_citadelle_du_roi_Henri_Christophe.JPG" srcset="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Les_Ramier%2C_citadelle_du_roi_Henri_Christophe.JPG/330px-Les_Ramier%2C_citadelle_du_roi_Henri_Christophe.JPG 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Les_Ramier%2C_citadelle_du_roi_Henri_Christophe.JPG/440px-Les_Ramier%2C_citadelle_du_roi_Henri_Christophe.JPG 2x" alt="" width="220" height="165" data-file-width="3648" data-file-height="2736" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload thumbimage" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20220%20165%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Les_Ramier%2C_citadelle_du_roi_Henri_Christophe.JPG/220px-Les_Ramier%2C_citadelle_du_roi_Henri_Christophe.JPG" data-srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Les_Ramier%2C_citadelle_du_roi_Henri_Christophe.JPG/330px-Les_Ramier%2C_citadelle_du_roi_Henri_Christophe.JPG 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Les_Ramier%2C_citadelle_du_roi_Henri_Christophe.JPG/440px-Les_Ramier%2C_citadelle_du_roi_Henri_Christophe.JPG 2x" alt="" width="220" height="165" data-file-width="3648" data-file-height="2736" /></span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Aerial view of a nearby gun emplacement<br /> From the Palace, walk a short distance to get a moto taxi.

The guide was completely useless and I refused to pay for him so Jaime (the soft touch) paid $30 and I paid $15 only for the 5 km moto ride, a fair price as he would normally only have got $10 as part of the original deal.

The museum traces Taínos, Spanish, and a section dedicated to the heroes of independence, including the silver gun with which Henri Christophe committed suicide, and the bell used to announce Haitian independence.

Jean-Jacques Desalines </strong>(1758–1806) initially served as an officer in the French Army, but became a commander in the revolt against France and subsequently the leader of the Haitian Revolution. He defeated the French army in 1803 and declared Haiti an independent nation in 1804. This officially ended the only slave rebellion in world history that successfully resulted in establishing an independent nation. Dessalines was chosen by a council of generals to assume the office of Governor-General. He ordered the 1804 Haiti massacre of the white Haitian minority, resulting in the deaths of between 3,000 and 5,000 people. In 1804, he proclaimed himself Emperor Jacques I of Haiti and ruled in that capacity until being assassinated in 1806. Dessalines is regarded as a founding father of Haiti.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Le Marron Inconnu</strong> (The Unknown Maroon&#8221;)is a bronze statue of a runaway slave, better known as a maroon, standing in the center of Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Completed on September 22 1967 by Haitian architect Albert Mangonès, the statue is regarded as a symbol of black liberation; commemorating in particular, the rallying cry that sparked the Haitian Revolution and the abolishment of slavery. Situated across from the National Palace,<sup id="cite_ref-Girard2011_8-0" class="reference">[8]</sup> it is the nation&#8217;s most iconic representation of the struggle for freedom.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">It measures 3.60 metres long by 2.40 metres high. It depicts in bronze a near-naked fugitive black man, kneeling on one knee, his torso arched, his opposite leg stretched back, and a broken chain on his left ankle. He holds a conch shell at his lips with his left hand, his head tilted upward to blow it, while the other hand holds a machete on the ground by his right ankle.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mangonès chose a passage from 1 Maccabees 14:3-9 of the Jerusalem Bible to be set in copper letters on one of the two concrete panels that protect the &#8220;eternal flame&#8221; of freedom in the square surrounding the statue.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Atis Rezistans,</strong> In the NM Bizzarium series, on<span class="section-start-text"> </span>Boulevard Jn J Dessalines set back from the main road behind a muddle of motorbikes and old cars, the wrought iron gate which marks the entrance is presided over by a human skull, red and white Christmas lights poking gaudily from its gaping eye sockets. Beneath the skull, a Latin slogan reads: “E Pluribus Unum”; <em>out of many, one</em>.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The place is a museum, an art collection, and a gallery. No matter what you call it, this courtyard tucked away behind the boulevard seems to defy any standard definition. The open-air space is crammed full of sculptures, ranging from palm-sized figurines through to towering daemonic effigies that hunch menacingly over the heads of visitors.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">If there is one uniting theme to this collection, other than the artists’ obvious penchant for the macabre, then it is the notion of salvage and recycling. The founding sculptors of the Haitian collective, André and Celeur, grew up around the area of Grand Rue in Port-au-Prince. Born out of a climate of “junkyard make-do, survivalist recycling, and artistic endeavor,” their self-taught artistic skills reflect the challenges of growing up in such an environment. Theirs is a unique and yet well-defined artistic style, one which prescribes the juxtaposition of metal and flesh, wood and bone. The work of the Grand Rue sculptors is often challenging. Disturbing, even. Children’s dolls appear stitched onto vacuum cleaners, while twisted automobile parts have been joined to human remains to create bizarre and otherworldly totems.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Now working with an expanded team of sculptors and artists, André and Celeur continue to use everyday items to tell new stories. The symbology of their work incorporates powerful themes of death and rebirth; of Vodou, Christianity and occultism; of slavery, of inevitable industrialization and its dystopian sci-fi aftermath.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>From Debjeet Sen&#8217;s excellent trip report on FB Every Passport Stamp.</em></span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is possible to have a safe and interesting visit to Haiti, if you go with the correct people and are aware of the security situation. Having a guide for Port-au-Prince was especially essential. The security situation in town is fluid and can be very bad in places. For example, the neighborhood near the ruined cathedral was blockaded by gangs, and the closer one gets to the water.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Moreover, there are several interesting sights that are difficult to find on your own, as they are tucked into rough and/or obscure neighborhoods.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">An excellent guide, Claude (many thanks to Suhas for the tip) to take me around town. He calls himself a “man of the street” and it shows. We walked around downtown and took moto-taxis to travel around some of the rougher neighborhoods and tap-tap’s to/from Petionville. I did not get the feeling it was safe to walk around much of downtown Port-au-Prince—even without taking photos—although short walks to the supermarket to pick up stuff and exchange money and to get food from a restaurant seemed fine. Claude’s can be easily engaged via Philip, the owner of Park Hotel, where I stayed. WhatsApp: +509 32 64 6351.

As is usually the case, there are a few local boys who will show you around in exchange for a small tip.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">From Port-au-Prince, I flew on Sunrise Airways to Cap-Haïtien. The 20-minute flight avoids the 6–12-hour drive. In Cap-Haïtien, I stayed at Habitation des Lauriers (WhatsApp: +509 38 36 0885).</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Palais Sans-Souci and La Citadelle.</em> It is perfectly straightforward to organize this day trip on public transport (tap-tap to Milot followed by moto taxi). The car dropped me at the upper parking lot, from where any reasonably fit person can hike to the Citadelle in 30–45 minutes. Lots of people will offer guiding services and a horse ride, but neither are needed in my opinion. The Citadelle is one of the coolest places I have visited—an absolute wonder. I saw Palais Sans-Souci on the way back—again avoiding any “guides.”</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Cap-Haïtien</em> is very walkable, although there are powercuts at night and it may be a good idea to get a taxi after dark. I crossed over to the Dominican Republic on Caribe Tours’ daily bus service to Santiago/Santo Domingo. The bus leaves Cap-Haïtien daily at 8am.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Stephan Muller.</strong> 25th September &#8211; 30th September 2021</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bus from Santo Domingo to Cap-Haitian for 37$ one way (Caribe Tours). No Covid test or return ticket required. Cap-Haitian is much better, relatively safe and incredible interesting. Don&#8217;t worry about kidnappings and assaults in that region. However, I was very lucky to find a nice and caring Couchsurfing host who assigned his friends to take me around and protect me. I posted their contact info in the video description (link below).</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The journey was a bit inconvenient since the city is suffering under a almost permanent blackout and gas shortage. Most people use generators, but due to the gas shortage even those are problematic. I first stayed with my couchsurfing host for 2 nights (which were the best days I&#8217;ve had). Since he is the general manager of a good hotel he lives in a back building and has permanent access to their electricity and expensive hotels use power nearly 24h, so I didn&#8217;t even realize that the city has a power problem. However, as he had friends coming from Port au Prince, I had to move and the cheapest private place I could find, which was an Airbnb for 40$. There&#8217;s also a hostel for 20$/night. However, my Airbnb host rarely used the generator so I moved to a hotel with AC (50$), but also the hotel was stingy with the gas and I only had electricity from 11pm-4am. And that was the biggest problem, because I could not sleep well if I don&#8217;t even have a fan at 30C+.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">See my trip summary here: https://youtu.be/6W47dorKw08 (real Haiti)</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">and the video of the most beautiful parts here: https://youtu.be/ApyjDPNh4vs</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong><br /> Orest Zub<br /> </strong>Travel independently. Spent 4 nights in total. During this time I visited Port-at-Prince, Cap Haitien, Citadel and a bit of countryside in between. It is absolutely doable on your own. I recommend one small backpack.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Get in.<br /> </em>Ounaminthe-Dajabon border crossing in the north</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">AirCentury flies every other day or so from Santo Domingo to PaP ~400 USD return for 30 min flight. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">AirAmerica and JetBlue.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Immigration is easy and straightforward. Foreigners pay some kind of fee &#8211; 10 USD.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Get Around<br /> </em>By car. Traffic is really bad. Once you get into the car you’re stuck forever. Don’t rent a car.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">From airport. Walk outside the airport 100 meter to the nearest petrol station for a motor taxi. 500 gourde (8 USD)</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Taxi airport pickup is 25 USD. 20 km from city. 50 USD/day hire for a day.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">By plane. Fly from PaP to Cap with Sunrise air. 100 USD, 20 min.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">By bus. Cap Haitian to PaP. Sans-Sousis operator, 20 USD, 5 hours, AC</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">By moto. Useful everywhere. Most drivers are honest and I didn’t have to bargain hard for a ride. 100-200 gourde (1-3 USD) is normal for a couple km rides.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Accommodation<br /> </em>Port au Prince. Park Hostel, actually a hotel in historical building with a nice hostel section in it. 17 USD/night. Situated on the central square of PaP inside large quite garden. Owner, Philip, super helpful</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Just next to the hotel there is a modern supermarket with all the goods and secure currency exchange office. Nearby there is also a lively bar area where you can eat properly, drink beer and hang out with locals. No problem with it. Once a bunch of guys didn’t even permit me to pay my bill.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Cap Haitien. Habitation des Lauriers, middle range hotel with fantastic views over the city. 50 USD for a budget room with breakfast. Don’t be afraid to walk up the slum towards hotel. Locals are fine with travelers there.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>See<br /> </em>PaP. Central area around Park Hotel with some admin buildings. I was advised not to move closer toward the sea into a slum. And didn’t do so reaching just the edge of it.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Petionville. Little of interest. However, cross it anyway towards the surrounding mountains.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Fort Jacques. great views over the city.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">L&#8217;Observatoire de Boutilliers. Food is overpriced and service was not good. Tips are not included into the bill.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The rest of town is absolute mess. Think of Conakry or Monrovia. Probably even worse.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Cap Haitien. Nice easy going town (only on the center) with a lot of preserved colonial architecture.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Citadel. The largest military structure in Western Hemisphere and really a stunning UNESCO place. Take a moto from outside Cap Airport just after arrival which is 20 km away. 1000 gourde return with waiting. Entry ticket is 10 USD. Bike up and down the mountain (6-7 km one way) another 10 USD with local guys.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>People/Safety.</em> Everybody in Dominican Republic assured me it’s impossible to move around without security and guides. However I assure you it’s absolutely the opposite.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">During the entire 5 days I never felt unsafe or experienced any kind of hostility from locals. Everybody is super friendly, polite and honest. Even when people usually can take advantage of situations (e.g. drivers, night time, touristic spots) nobody used this chance or pushed hard.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The only not very comfortable situation was the following. Once we approached village Milot (below Citadel) with my moto driver local guys started to follow us on bikes shouting to stop.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">My driver got a bit nervous but I calmly clap him on a shoulder and told not to stop. Once we reached ticket gates and stopped to buy a ticket locals explained that there is some kind of local tourist association in village.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Since I’ve heard a lot of stories like this around the world we carried on with a drive uphill. However it’s get quite steep and my driver started to feel uncomfortable on the road. Eventually I decided to let him wait near the gate and took another local guy to drive me up for 10 USD (6-7 km). It’s always good to leave something in the community. Meanwhile their guiding offers and horse rides where not pushy at all.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Inconveniences. </em>The most challenging in Haiti is probably finding proper food. Selection is not great and very expensive. A bowl of rice with questionable chicken on a bus stop &#8211; 7 USD. Simple Hamburger in high end restaurant &#8211; 13 USD. Pizza &#8211; 17 USD.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">I don’t understand how locals handle it since there are no tourists. I was always the only “le blanc” (white) around. Even fruits are not easy to get. The bar area near Park Hotel in PaP is a real gem.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Always use your chance to grab a normal bite. Have breakfast in hotels and don’t mind stopping if you see something okay-ish.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>HAITI &#8211; GENERAL INFO</strong></span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><b>Haiti</b> officially the <b>Republic of Haiti</b> is a country located on the island of Hispaniola in the Greater Antilles archipelago of the Caribbean Sea, to the east of Cuba and Jamaica and south of The Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. It occupies the western three-eighths of the island which it shares with the Dominican Republic. To its south-west lies the small Navassa Island, which is claimed by Haiti but is disputed as a United States territory under federal administration. Haiti is 27,750 km<sup>2</sup> (10,714 sq mi) in size, the third largest country in the Caribbean by area, and has an estimated population of 11.4 million, making it the most populous country in the Caribbean. The capital is Port-au-Prince.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The island was originally inhabited by the indigenous Taíno people, who originated in South America. The first Europeans arrived on 5 December 1492 during the first voyage of Christopher Columbus, who initially believed he had found India or China. Columbus subsequently founded the first European settlement in the Americas, La Navidad, on what is now the northeastern coast of Haiti. The island was claimed by Spain and named <span title="Spanish-language text"><i lang="es">La Española</i></span>, forming part of the Spanish Empire until the early 17th century. However, competing claims and settlements by the French-led to the western portion of the island being ceded to France in 1697, which was subsequently named <span title="French-language text"><i lang="fr">Saint-Domingue</i></span>. French colonists established lucrative sugarcane plantations, worked by vast numbers of slaves brought from Africa, which made the colony one of the richest in the world.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the midst of the French Revolution (1789–99), slaves and free people of color launched the Haitian Revolution (1791–1804), led by a former slave and the first black general of the French Army, Toussaint Louverture. After 12 years of conflict, Napoleon Bonaparte&#8217;s forces were defeated by Louverture&#8217;s successor, Jean-Jacques Dessalines (later Emperor Jacques I), who declared Haiti&#8217;s sovereignty on 1 January 1804—the first independent nation of Latin America and the Caribbean, the second republic in the Americas, the first country in the Americas to abolish slavery, and the only state in history established by a successful slave revolt. Apart from Alexandre Pétion, the first President of the Republic, all of Haiti&#8217;s first leaders were former slaves. After a brief period in which the country was split in two, President Jean-Pierre Boyer united the country and then attempted to bring the whole of Hispaniola under Haitian control, precipitating a long series of wars that ended in the 1870s when Haiti formally recognized the independence of the Dominican Republic.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Haiti&#8217;s first century of independence was characterized by political instability, ostracism by the international community, and the payment of crippling debt to France. Political volatility and foreign economic influence in the country prompted the U.S. to occupy the country from 1915 to 1934. Following a series of short-lived presidencies, François &#8216;Papa Doc&#8217; Duvalier took power in 1956, ushering in a long period of autocratic rule continued by his son, Jean-Claude &#8216;Baby Doc&#8217; Duvalier, that lasted until 1986; the period was characterized by state-sanctioned violence against the opposition and civilians, corruption, and economic stagnation. After 1986, Haiti began attempting to establish a more democratic political system.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Historically poor and politically unstable, Haiti has the lowest Human Development Index in the Americas. Since the turn of the 21st century, the country has endured a coup d&#8217;état, which prompted U.N. intervention, as well as a catastrophic earthquake that killed over 250,000 people.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><i>Haiti</i> (also earlier <i>Hayti</i>) comes from the indigenous Taíno language, in which it means &#8220;land of high mountains&#8221; and named the entire island of Hispaniola. The name was restored by Haitian revolutionary Jean-Jacques Dessalines as the official name of independent Saint-Domingue, as a tribute to the Amerindian predecessors.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">In French, Haiti&#8217;s nickname means the &#8220;Pearl of the Antilles&#8221; (<i>La Perle des Antilles</i>) because of both its natural beauty and the amount of wealth it accumulated for the Kingdom of France. During the 18th century the colony was the world&#8217;s leading producer of sugar and coffee.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>HISTORY </strong></span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span id="Pre-Columbian_history" class="mw-headline"><strong>Pre-Columbian history</strong><br /> </span><noscript><img decoding="async" class="thumbimage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Copia_de_Cacicazgos_de_la_Hispaniola.png/350px-Copia_de_Cacicazgos_de_la_Hispaniola.png" srcset="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Copia_de_Cacicazgos_de_la_Hispaniola.png/525px-Copia_de_Cacicazgos_de_la_Hispaniola.png 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Copia_de_Cacicazgos_de_la_Hispaniola.png/700px-Copia_de_Cacicazgos_de_la_Hispaniola.png 2x" alt="" width="350" height="175" data-file-width="2341" data-file-height="1171" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload thumbimage" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20350%20175%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Copia_de_Cacicazgos_de_la_Hispaniola.png/350px-Copia_de_Cacicazgos_de_la_Hispaniola.png" data-srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Copia_de_Cacicazgos_de_la_Hispaniola.png/525px-Copia_de_Cacicazgos_de_la_Hispaniola.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Copia_de_Cacicazgos_de_la_Hispaniola.png/700px-Copia_de_Cacicazgos_de_la_Hispaniola.png 2x" alt="" width="350" height="175" data-file-width="2341" data-file-height="1171" /></span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The five caciquedoms of Hispaniola at the time of the arrival of Christopher Columbus</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The island of Hispaniola, of which Haiti occupies the western three-eighths, has been inhabited since about 5000 BC by groups of Native Americans thought to have arrived from Central or South America. Genetic studies show that some of these groups were related to the Yanomami of the Amazon Basin. Amongst these early settlers were the Ciboney peoples, followed by the Taíno, speakers of an Arawakan language, elements of which have been preserved in Haitian Creole. The Taíno name for the entire island was <i>Haiti</i>, or alternatively <i>Quisqeya</i>.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">In Taíno society the largest unit of political organization was led by a <i>cacique,</i> or chief, as the Europeans understood them. The island of Hispaniola was divided into five &#8216;caciquedoms&#8217;: the Magua in the northeast, the Marien in the northwest, the Jaragua in the southwest, the Maguana in the central regions of Cibao, and the Higüey in the southeast.<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><br /> </sup>Taíno cultural artifacts include cave paintings in several locations in the country.

As a result, piracy became widespread, encouraged by European powers hostile to Spain such as France (based on Île de la Tortue) and England. The Spanish largely abandoned the western third of the island, focusing their colonization effort on the eastern two-thirds. The western part of the island was thus gradually settled by French buccaneers; among them was Bertrand d&#8217;Ogeron, who succeeded in growing tobacco and recruited many French colonial families from Martinique and Guadeloupe. In 1697 France and Spain settled their hostilities on the island by way of the Treaty of Ryswick of 1697, which divided Hispaniola between them.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span id="French_rule_.281625.E2.80.931804.29"></span><strong><span id="French_rule_(1625–1804)" class="mw-headline">French rule (1625–1804). </span></strong>France received the western third and subsequently named it Saint-Domingue, the French equivalent of <i>Santo Domingo</i>, the Spanish colony on Hispaniola. The French set about creating sugar and coffee plantations, worked by vast numbers of slaves imported from Africa, and Saint-Domingue grew to become their richest colonial possession.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The French settlers were outnumbered by slaves by almost 10 to 1.<sup id="cite_ref-Bradt11_61-2" class="reference">[58]</sup> According to the 1788 Census, Haiti&#8217;s population consisted of nearly 25,000 Europeans, 22,000 free coloreds and 700,000 African slaves. In contrast, by 1763 the white population of French Canada, a far larger territory, had numbered only 65,000. In the north of the island, slaves were able to retain many ties to African cultures, religion, and language; these ties were continually being renewed by newly imported Africans.

Washington, who was a slave holder and isolationist, kept the United States neutral, although private US citizens at times provided aid to French planters trying to put down the revolt. John Adams, a vocal opponent of slavery, fully supported the slave revolt by providing diplomatic recognition, financial support, munitions and warships (including the USS Constitution) beginning in 1798. This support ended in 1801 when Jefferson, another slave-holding president, took office and recalled the US Navy.<sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><br /> </sup>With slavery abolished, Toussaint Louverture pledged allegiance to France, and he fought off the British and Spanish forces who had taken advantage of the situation and invaded Saint-Domingue. The Spanish were later forced to cede their part of the island to France under the terms of the Peace of Basel in 1795, uniting the island under one government. However an insurgency against French rule broke out in the east, and in the west, there was fighting between Louverture&#8217;s forces and the free people of color-led by André Rigaud in the War of the Knives (1799–1800). Many surviving free people of color left the island as refugees.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">After Louverture created a separatist constitution and proclaimed himself governor-general for life, Napoléon Bonaparte in 1802 sent an expedition of 20,000 soldiers and as many sailors<sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference">[75]</sup> under the command of his brother-in-law, Charles Leclerc, to reassert French control.

However, in a report to the Secretary of the Navy, he reported the death toll as being 3,250. Haitian historians have claimed the true number was much higher, but this is not supported by most historians outside Haiti. Recognition of the distinctive traditionalism of the Haitian people had an influence on American writers, including Eugene O&#8217;Neill, James Weldon Johnson, Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston and Orson Welles.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span id="Post-occupation_era_.281934.E2.80.931957.29"></span><strong><span id="Post-occupation_era_(1934–1957)" class="mw-headline">Post-occupation era (1934–1957). </span></strong>After US forces left in 1934, Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo used anti-Haitian sentiment as a nationalist tool.

The nation ranked first of all countries surveyed for levels of perceived domestic corruption. It is estimated that President &#8220;Baby Doc&#8221; Duvalier, his wife Michelle, and their agents stole US $504 million from the country&#8217;s treasury between 1971 and 1986. Similarly, after the Haitian Army folded in 1995, the Haitian National Police (HNP) gained sole power of authority over the Haitian citizens. Many Haitians as well as observers of Haitian society believe that this monopolized power could have given way to a corrupt police force.<sup id="cite_ref-Haiti:_Police_and_Law_Enforcement_256-0" class="reference"><br /> </sup>Similarly, some media outlets alleged that millions were stolen by former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide. In March 2004, at the time of Aristide&#8217;s kidnapping, a BBC article wrote that the Bush administration&#8217;s State Department stated that Aristide had been involved in drug trafficking. The BBC also described pyramid schemes, in which Haitians lost hundreds of millions in 2002, as the &#8220;only real economic initiative&#8221; of the Aristide years.<sup id="cite_ref-basketcase_262-0" class="reference"><br /> </sup>Conversely, according to the 2013 United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) report, murder rates in Haiti (10.2 per 100,000) are far <i>below</i> the regional average (26 per 100,000); less than <span class="sfrac tion" role="math"><span class="num">1</span><span class="sr-only">/</span><span class="den">4</span></span> that of Jamaica (39.3 per 100,000) and nearly <span class="sfrac tion" role="math"><span class="num">1</span><span class="sr-only">/</span><span class="den">2</span></span> that of the Dominican Republic (22.1 per 100,000), making it among the safer countries in the region. In large part, this is due to the country&#8217;s ability to fulfill a pledge by increasing its national police yearly by 50%, a four-year initiative that was started in 2012. In addition to the yearly recruits, the Haitian National Police (HNP) has been using innovative technologies to crack down on crime. A notable bust in recent years led to the dismantlement of the largest kidnapping ring in the country with the use of an advanced software program developed by a West Point-trained Haitian official that proved to be so effective that it has led to its foreign advisers to make inquiries.<sup id="cite_ref-265" class="reference"><br /> </sup>In 2010, the New York City Police Department (NYPD) sent a team of veteran officers to Haiti to assist in the rebuilding of its police force with special training in investigative techniques, strategies to improve the anti-kidnapping personnel, and community outreach to build stronger relationships with the public, especially among the youth.

Despite its tourism industry, Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the Americas, with corruption, political instability, poor infrastructure, lack of health care and lack of education cited as the main causes. Unemployment is high and many Haitians seek to emigrate. Trade declined dramatically after the 2010 earthquake and subsequent outbreak of cholera, with the country&#8217;s purchasing power parity GDP falling by 8% (from US$12.15 billion to US$11.18 billion), Haiti ranked 145th of 182 countries in the 2010 United Nations Human Development Index, with 57.3% of the population being deprived in at least three of the HDI&#8217;s poverty measures.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Following the disputed 2000 election and accusations about President Aristide&#8217;s rule, US aid to the Haitian government was cut off between 2001 and 2004. After Aristide&#8217;s departure in 2004, aid was restored and the Brazilian army led a United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti peacekeeping operation. After almost four years of recession, the economy grew by 1.5% in 2005. In September 2009, Haiti met the conditions set out by the IMF and World Bank&#8217;s Heavily Indebted Poor Countries program to qualify for the cancellation of its external debt.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">More than 90 percent of the government&#8217;s budget comes from an agreement with Petrocaribe, a Venezuela-led oil alliance.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Foreign aid.</strong> Haiti received more than US$4 billion in aid from 1990 to 2003, including US$1.5 billion from the United States. The largest donor is the US, followed by Canada and the European Union. In January 2010, following the earthquake, US President Barack Obama promised US$1.15 billion in assistance. European Union nations pledged more than €400 million (US$616 million). Neighboring Dominican Republic has also provided extensive humanitarian aid to Haiti, including the funding and construction of a public university, human capital, free healthcare services in the border region, and logistical support after the 2010 earthquake.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The United Nations states that in total US$13.34 billion has been earmarked for post-earthquake reconstruction through 2020, though two years after the 2010 quake, less than half of that amount had actually been released, according to UN documents. As of 2015, the US government has allocated US$4 billion, US$3 billion has already been spent, and the rest is dedicated to longer-term projects.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Trade.</strong> According to the 2015 CIA World Factbook, Haiti&#8217;s main import partners are: Dominican Republic 35%, US 26.8%, Netherlands Antilles 8.7%, China 7% (est. 2013). Haiti&#8217;s main export partner is the US 83.5% (est. 2013). Haiti had a trade deficit of US$3 billion in 2011, or 41% of GDP.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Energy. In 1925, the city of Jacmel was the first area in the Caribbean to have electricity and was subsequently dubbed the <i>City of Light.<br /> </i>Today, Haiti relies heavily on an oil alliance with Petrocaribe for much of its energy requirements. In recent years, hydroelectric, solar and wind energy have been explored as possible sustainable energy sources.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">As of 2017, among all the countries in the Americas, Haiti is producing the least energy. Less than a quarter of the country has electric coverage. Most regions of Haiti that do have energy are powered by generators. These generators are often expensive and produce a lot of pollution. The areas that do get electricity experience power cuts on a daily basis, and some areas are limited to 12 hours of electricity a day. Electricity is provided by a small number of independent companies: Sogener, E-power, and Haytrac. There is no national electricity grid within the country. The most common source of energy used is wood, along with charcoal. In Haiti, about 4 million metric tons of wood products are consumed yearly. Like charcoal and wood, petroleum is also an important source of energy for Haiti. Since Haiti cannot produce its own fuel, all fuel is imported. Yearly, around 691,000 tons of oil is imported into the country.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">On 31 October 2018, Evenson Calixte, the General Director of energy regulation (ANARSE) announced the 24 hour electricity project. To meet this objective, 236 MW needs to installed in Port-au-Prince alone, with an additional 75 MW needed in all other regions in the country. Presently only 27.5% of the population has access to electricity; moreover, the national energy agency l&#8217;Électricité d&#8217;Haïti (Ed&#8217;H) is only able to meet 62% of overall electricity demand<br /> </span><span id="Personal_income" class="mw-headline" style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Personal income.</strong> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Haiti suffers from a shortage of skilled labor, widespread unemployment, and underemployment. Most Haitians in the labor force have informal jobs. Three-quarters of the population live on US$2 or less per day.<br /> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Remittances from Haitians living abroad are the primary source of foreign exchange, equaling one-fifth (20%) of GDP and more than five times the earnings from exports as of 2012. In 2004, 80% or more of college graduates from Haiti were living abroad.<br /> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Occasionally, families who are unable to care for children financially may send them to live with a wealthier family as a </span><i style="font-size: 12pt;">restavek</i><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, or house servant. In return the family are supposed to ensure that the child is educated and provided with food and shelter, however the system is open to abuse and has proved controversial, with some likening it to child slavery.<br /> </span><strong style="font-size: 12pt;"><span id="Real_estate" class="mw-headline">Real estate. </span></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In rural areas, people often live in wooden huts with corrugated iron roofs. Outhouses are located in the back of the huts. In Port-au-Prince, colorful shantytowns surround the central city and go up the mountainsides.|<br /> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The middle and upper classes live in suburbs, or in the central part of the bigger cities in apartments, where there is urban planning. Many of the houses they live in are like miniature fortresses, located behind walls embedded with metal spikes, barbed wire, broken glass, and sometimes all three. The gates to these houses are barred at night, the house is locked; guard dogs patrol the yard. These houses are often self-sufficient as well. The houses have backup generators because the electrical grid in Haiti is unreliable. Some even have rooftop reservoirs for water, as the water supply is also unreliable.<br /> </span><span id="Agriculture" class="mw-headline" style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Agriculture.</strong> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Haiti is the world&#8217;s leading producer of vetiver, a root plant used to make luxury perfumes, essential oils, and fragrances, providing for half the world&#8217;s supply. Roughly 40–50% of Haitians work in the agricultural sector.Haiti relies upon imports for half its food needs and 80% of its rice. Haiti exports crops such as mangoes, cacao, coffee, papayas, mahogany nuts, spinach, and watercress. Agricultural products comprise 6% of all exports. In addition, local agricultural products include maize, beans, cassava, sweet potato, peanuts, pistachios, bananas, millet, pigeon peas, sugarcane, rice, sorghum, and wood.<br /> </span><span id="Currency" class="mw-headline" style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Currency.</strong> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Haitian gourde (HTG) is the national currency. The &#8220;Haitian dollar&#8221; equates to 5 gourdes (</span><i style="font-size: 12pt;">goud</i><span style="font-size: 12pt;">), which is a fixed exchange rate that exists in concept </span><i style="font-size: 12pt;">only,</i><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> but are commonly used as informal prices. The vast majority of the business sector and individuals in Haiti will also accept US dollars, though at the outdoor markets gourdes may be preferred. Locals may refer to the USD as &#8220;dollar américain&#8221; (</span><i style="font-size: 12pt;">dola ameriken</i><span style="font-size: 12pt;">) or &#8220;dollar US&#8221; (pronounced </span><i style="font-size: 12pt;">oo-es</i><span style="font-size: 12pt;">).<br /> </span><strong style="font-size: 12pt;"><span id="Tourism" class="mw-headline">Tourism. </span></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The tourism market in Haiti is undeveloped and the government is heavily promoting this sector. Haiti has many of the features that attract tourists to other Caribbean destinations, such as white sand beaches, mountainous scenery, and a year-round warm climate. However, the country&#8217;s poor image overseas, at times exaggerated, has hampered the development of this sector. In 2014, the country received 1,250,000 tourists (mostly from cruise ships), and the industry generated US$200 million in 2014.<br /> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Several hotels were opened in 2014, including an upscale Best Western Premier, a five-star Royal Oasis hotel by Occidental Hotel and Resorts in Pétion-Ville,m a four-star Marriott Hotel in the Turgeau area of Port-au-Prince and other new hotel developments in Port-au-Prince, Les Cayes, Cap-Haïtien, and Jacmel.<br /> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Haitian Carnival has been one of the most popular carnivals in the Caribbean. In 2010, the government decided to stage the event in a different city outside Port-au-Prince every year in an attempt to decentralize the country. The National Carnival – usually held in one of the country&#8217;s largest cities (i.e., Port-au-Prince, Cap-Haïtien or Les Cayes) – follows the also very popular Jacmel Carnival, which takes place a week earlier in February or March.<br /> </span><span id="Caracol_Industrial_Park" class="mw-headline" style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Caracol Industrial Park</strong>. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On 21 October 2012, Haitian President Michel Martelly, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Richard Branson, Ben Stiller and Sean Penn inaugurated the 240-hectare (600-acre) Caracol industrial park, the largest in the Caribbean. Costing US$300 million, the project, which includes a 10-megawatt power plant, a water-treatment plant, and worker housing, is intended to transform the northern part of the country by creating 65,000 jobs.<br /> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The park is part of a &#8220;master plan&#8221; for Haiti&#8217;s North and North-East departments, including the expansion of the Cap-Haïtien International Airport to accommodate large international flights, the construction of an international seaport in Fort-Liberté and the opening of the $50 million Roi Henri Christophe Campus of a new university in Limonade (near Cap-Haïtien) on 12 January 2012.<br /> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">South Korean clothing manufacturer Sae-A Trading Co. Ltd, one of the park&#8217;s main tenants, has created 5,000 permanent jobs out of the 20,000 projected and has built 8,600 houses in the surrounding area for its workers. The industrial park ultimately has the potential to create as many as 65,000 jobs once fully developed.</span><sup id="cite_ref-320" class="reference">[317]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-321" class="reference">[318]</sup></p></div></div><h2><strong><span id="Infrastructure" class="mw-headline" style="font-size: 12pt;">INFRASTRUCTURE<br /> </span></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Transportation. Haiti has two main highways that run from one end of the country to the other. The northern highway, Route Nationale No. 1 (National Highway One), originates in Port-au-Prince, winding through the coastal towns of Montrouis and Gonaïves, before reaching its terminus at the northern port Cap-Haïtien. The southern highway, Route Nationale No. 2, links Port-au-Prince with Les Cayes via Léogâne and Petit-Goâve. The state of Haiti&#8217;s roads are generally poor, many being potholed and becoming impassable in rough weather.<sup id="cite_ref-Encylopedia_Britannica_-_Haiti_21-58" class="reference"><br /> </sup></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">According to the Washington Post, &#8220;Officials from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Saturday [23 January 2010] that they assessed the damage from the [12 January] quake in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and found that many of the roads aren&#8217;t any worse than they were before because they&#8217;ve always been in poor condition.&#8221;</span></h2><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The port at Port-au-Prince, Port international de Port-au-Prince, has more registered shipping than any of the other dozen ports in the country. The port&#8217;s facilities include cranes, large berths, and warehouses, but these facilities are not in good condition. The port is underused, possibly due to the substantially high port fees.

I have been retired since 2006 and in that time have traveled every winter for four to seven months. The months that I am "home", are often also spent on the road, hiking or kayaking. 
I hope to present a website that describes my travel along with my hiking and sea kayaking experiences.<div id="author-link"> <a href="../../../../author/admin/index.html" rel="author"> View all posts by admin <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span> </a></div></div></div><div class="entry-utility"> This entry was posted in <a href="../../../../category/uncategorized/index.html" rel="category tag">Uncategorized</a>.
