In America, from the late 19th century until sometime in the 1950s, the superior person was the Well-Bred Man. Such a man was born into one of the old WASP families that dominated the elite social circles on Fifth Avenue, in New York City; the Main Line, outside Philadelphia; Beacon Hill, in Boston. He was molded at a prep school like Groton or Choate, and came of age at Harvard, Yale, or Princeton. In those days, you didn’t have to be brilliant or hardworking to get into Harvard, but it really helped if you were “clubbable”—good-looking, athletic, graceful, casually elegant, Episcopalian, and white. It really helped, too, if your dad had gone there.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Once on campus, studying was frowned upon. Those who cared about academics—the “grinds”—were social outcasts. But students competed ferociously to get into the elite social clubs: Ivy at Princeton, Skull and Bones at Yale, the Porcellian at Harvard. These clubs provided the well-placed few with the connections that would help them ascend to white-shoe law firms, to prestigious banks, to the State Department, perhaps even to the White House. (From 1901 to 1921, every American president went to Harvard, Yale, or Princeton.) People living according to this social ideal valued not academic accomplishment but refined manners, prudent judgment, and the habit of command. This was the age of social privilege.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">And then a small group of college administrators decided to blow it all up. The most important of them was James Conant, the president of Harvard from 1933 to 1953. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1940/05/education-for-a-classless-society/305254/" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="4510882" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">Conant looked around and concluded</a> that American democracy was being undermined by a “hereditary aristocracy of wealth.” American capitalism, <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780618773558" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="4510832" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">he argued</a>, was turning into “industrial feudalism,” in which a few ultrarich families had too much corporate power. Conant did not believe the United States could rise to the challenges of the 20th century if it was led by the heirs of a few incestuously interconnected Mayflower families.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">So Conant and others set out to get rid of admissions criteria based on bloodlines and breeding and replace them with criteria centered on brainpower. His system was predicated on the idea that the highest human trait is intelligence, and that intelligence is revealed through academic achievement.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">By shifting admissions criteria in this way, he hoped to realize Thomas Jefferson’s dream of a natural aristocracy of talent, culling the smartest people from all ranks of society. Conant wanted to create a nation with more social mobility and less class conflict. He presided during a time, roughly the middle third of the 20th century, when people had lavish faith in social-engineering projects and central planning—in using scientific means to, say, run the Soviet economy, or build new cities like Brasília, or construct a system of efficiency-maximizing roadways that would have cut through Greenwich Village.</p> <aside class="ArticlePullquote_root__z11cW" data-flatplan-pullquote="true">When universities like Harvard shifted their definition of ability, large segments of society adjusted to meet that definition. The effect was transformative.</aside> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In trying to construct a society that maximized talent, Conant and his peers were governed by the common assumptions of the era: Intelligence, that highest human trait, can be measured by standardized tests and the ability to do well in school from ages 15 to 18. Universities should serve as society’s primary sorting system, segregating the smart from the not smart. Intelligence is randomly distributed across the population, so sorting by intelligence will yield a broad-based leadership class. Intelligence is innate, so rich families won’t be able to buy their kids higher grades. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=sByHU2hUvVAC" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="7600" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">As Conant put it</a>, “At least half of higher education, I believe, is a matter of selecting, sorting, and classifying students.” By reimagining college-admissions criteria, Conant hoped to spark a social and cultural revolution. The age of the Well-Bred Man was vanishing. The age of the Cognitive Elite was here.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">At first, Conant’s record did not match his rhetoric. He couldn’t afford to offend the rich families who supplied Harvard with its endowment. In 1951, 18 years into his presidency, <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780618773558" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="9184" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">the university was still accepting 94 percent of its legacy applicants</a>. When Jews with high grades and test scores began to flood in, Harvard limited the number of applicants it would consider from New Jersey and parts of New York—places that had a lot of Jews.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">But eventually Conant’s vision triumphed and helped comprehensively refashion American life. If you control the choke points of social mobility, then you control the nation’s culture. And if you change the criteria for admission at places such as Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, then you change the nation’s social ideal.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">When universities like Harvard shifted their definition of ability, large segments of society adjusted to meet that definition. The effect was transformative, as though someone had turned on a powerful magnet and filaments across wide swaths of the culture suddenly snapped to attention in the same direction.Status markers changed. In 1967, <a href="https://www.nationalaffairs.com/storage/app/uploads/public/58e/1a4/a2b/58e1a4a2b88ce619080580.pdf" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="68999" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">the sociologist Daniel Bell noted</a> that the leadership in the emerging social order was coming from “the intellectual institutions.” “Social prestige and social status,” he foresaw, “will be rooted in the intellectual and scientific communities.”</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Family life changed as parents tried to produce the sort of children who could get into selective colleges. Over time, America developed two entirely different approaches to parenting. Working-class parents still practice what the sociologist Annette Lareau, in her book <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780520271425" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="142716" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1"><i>Unequal Childhoods</i></a>, called “natural growth” parenting. They let kids be kids, allowing them to wander and explore. College-educated parents, in contrast, practice “concerted cultivation,” ferrying their kids from one supervised skill-building, résumé-enhancing activity to another. It turns out that if you put parents in a highly competitive status race, they will go completely bonkers trying to hone their kids into little avatars of success.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Elementary and high schools changed too. The time dedicated to <a href="https://www.kpbs.org/news/education/2024/01/29/the-way-kids-play-has-quietly-transformed-heres-why-that-matters" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="180349" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">recess</a>, <a href="https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/2008-SPPA-ArtsLearning.pdf" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="180354" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">art</a>, and <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2014/2014901.pdf" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="180449" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">shop class</a> was reduced, in part so students could spend more of their day enduring volleys of standardized tests and Advanced Placement classes. Today, even middle-school students have been so thoroughly assessed that they know whether the adults have deemed them smart or not. The good test-takers get funneled into the meritocratic pressure cooker; the bad test-takers learn, by about age 9 or 10, that society does not value them the same way. (Too often, this eventually leads them to simply check out from school and society.) By 11th grade, the high-IQ students and their parents have spent so many years immersed in the college-admissions game that they, like 18th-century aristocrats evaluating which family has the most noble line, are able to make all sorts of fine distinctions about which universities have the most prestige: Princeton is better than Cornell; Williams is better than Colby. Universities came to realize that the more people they reject, the more their cachet soars. Some of these rejection academies run marketing campaigns to lure more and more applicants—and then brag about turning away 96 percent of them.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">America’s opportunity structure changed as well. It’s gotten harder to secure a good job if you lack a college degree, especially an elite college degree. When I started in journalism, in the 1980s, older working-class reporters still roamed the newsroom. Today, journalism is a profession reserved almost exclusively for college grads, especially elite ones.

Then they identify five to 15 additional schools—the likes of Amherst, Pomona, and Berkeley—from which they will more passively accept applications. The résumés of students from other schools will almost certainly never even get read.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“Number one people go to number one schools” is how one lawyer explained her firm’s recruiting principle to Rivera. That’s it, in a sentence: Conant’s dream of universities as the engines of social and economic segregation has been realized.</p> <h3 class="ArticleLegacyHtml_root__WFd2I ArticleLegacyHtml_standard__kC_zi"><span class="smallcaps"><span class="caps">Did We Get a Better Elite?</span></span></h3> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span class="smallcaps">Conant’s reforms</span> should have led to an American golden age.

They are impressive institutions filled with impressive people. But they remain stuck in the apparatus that Conant and his peers put in place before 1950. In fact, all of us are trapped in this vast sorting system. Parents can’t unilaterally disarm, lest their children get surpassed by the children of the tiger mom down the street. Teachers can’t teach what they love, because the system is built around teaching to standardized tests. Students can’t focus on the academic subjects they’re passionate about, because the gods of the grade point average demand that they get straight A’s. Even being a well-rounded kid with multiple interests can be self-defeating, because admissions officers are seeking the proverbial “spiky” kids—the ones who stand out for having cultivated some highly distinct skill or identity. All of this militates against a childhood full of curiosity and exploration.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Most admissions officers at elite universities genuinely want to see each candidate as a whole person. They genuinely want to build a campus with a diverse community and a strong learning environment. But they, like the rest of us, are enmeshed in the mechanism that segregates not by what we personally admire, but by what the system, typified by the <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report </i>college rankings, demands.

And because members of the educated class dominate media and culture, they possess the power of consecration, the power to determine what gets admired and what gets ignored or disdained. Goodhart notes further that over the past two decades, it’s been as though “an enormous social vacuum cleaner has sucked up status from manual occupations, even skilled ones,” and reallocated that status to white-collar jobs, even low-level ones, in “prosperous metropolitan centers and university towns.” This has had terrible social and political consequences.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>5. The meritocracy has damaged the psyches of the American elite. </b>The meritocracy is a gigantic system of extrinsic rewards. Its gatekeepers—educators, corporate recruiters, and workplace supervisors—impose a series of assessments and hurdles upon the young. Students are trained to be good hurdle-clearers. We shower them with approval or disapproval depending on how they measure up on any given day. Childhood and adolescence are thus lived within an elaborate system of conditional love. Students learn to ride an emotional roller coaster—congratulating themselves for clearing a hurdle one day and demoralized by their failure the next. This leads to an existential fragility: If you don’t keep succeeding by somebody else’s metrics, your self-worth crumbles.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Some young people get overwhelmed by the pressure and simply drop out. <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781476702728" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="3062954" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">Others learn to become shrewd players of the game</a>, interested only in doing what’s necessary to get good grades.

Any sorting system, they argue, is inherently elitist and unjust. We should get rid of selective admissions. We should get rid of the system that divides elite from non-elite. All students should be treated equally and all schools should have equal resources.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">I appreciate that impulse. But the fact is that every human society throughout history has been hierarchical. (If anything, that’s been especially true for those societies, such as Soviet Russia and Maoist China, that professed to be free of class hierarchy.) What determines a society’s health is not the existence of an elite, but the effectiveness of the elite, and whether the relationship between the elites and everybody else is mutually respectful.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">And although the current system may overvalue IQ, we do still need to find and train the people best equipped to be nuclear physicists and medical researchers.

And for all the American education system’s flaws, our elite universities are doing pioneering research, generating tremendous advances in fields such as biotech, launching bright students into the world, and driving much of the American economy. Our top universities remain the envy of the world.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The challenge is not to end the meritocracy; it’s to humanize and improve it.

This demographic decline will require some colleges not just to rebrand themselves, but to reinvent themselves in creative ways if they are to remain financially afloat. In a reformed meritocracy, perhaps colleges now struggling with declining enrollments might develop their own distinctive niches in the ecosystem, their own distinctive ways of defining and nurturing talent. This in turn could help give rise to an educational ecosystem in which colleges are not all arrayed within a single status hierarchy, with Harvard, Yale, and Princeton on top and everyone else below. If we could get to the point where being snobby about going to Stanford seems as ridiculous as being snobby about your great-grandmother’s membership in the Daughters of the American Revolution, this would transform not just college admissions but American childhood.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW ArticleParagraph_dropcap__uIVzg" data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true"><span class="smallcaps">The crucial first </span><span class="smallcaps">step</span> is to change how we define merit. The history of the meritocracy is the history of different definitions of ability. But how do we come up with a definition of ability that is better and more capacious than the one Conant left us? We can start by noting the flaws at the core of his definition. He and his peers were working at a time when people were optimistic that the rational application of knowledge in areas such as statistics, economics, psychology, management theory, and engineering could solve social problems. They admired technicians who valued quantification, objectification, optimization, efficiency.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">They had great faith in raw brainpower and naturally adopted a rationalist view of humans: Reason is separate from emotions. Economists and political scientists of the era gravitated toward models that were based on the idea that you could view people as perfectly rational actors maximizing their utility, and accurately predict their behavior based on that.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Social engineers with this mindset can seem impressively empirical. But over the course of the 20th century, the rationalist planning schemes—the public-housing projects in America’s cities, the central economic planning in the Soviet Union—consistently failed. And they failed for the same reason: The rationalists assumed that whatever can’t be counted and measured doesn’t matter. But it does. Rationalist schemes fail because life is too complex for their quantification methods.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780300246759" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="3621839" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1"><i>Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed</i></a>, James C. Scott, the late political scientist and anthropologist, describes a 19th-century German effort to improve the nation’s lumber industry. To make forests amenable to scientific quantification, planners had to redefine what <i>forest </i>meant. Trees became <i>timber</i>, and everything not a tree was designated as <i>underbrush</i>—useless stuff that got in the way when workers tried to efficiently harvest the timber.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The German rationalists reorganized the forests, planting new trees in neat rows and clearing away all the underbrush. At first, everything seemed to go well. But as the Germans discovered too late, the trees needed the underbrush to thrive. Without the organic messiness that the rationalists had deemed superfluous, the trees’ nutrient cycle got out of whack. They began ailing. A new word entered the German language—<i>Waldsterben</i>, or “forest death.”</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">By focusing on only those parts of the forest that seemed instrumental to their uses, the planners failed to see the forest accurately. In trying to standardize and control the growth process, the planners murdered the trees.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The modern meritocracy misunderstands human beings the same way the German rationalists misunderstood trees. To make people legible to the sorting system, researchers draw a distinction between what they call “cognitive” and “noncognitive” skills. Cognitive skills are the “hard” ones that can be easily measured, such as IQ and scores on an algebra test. Noncognitive skills are fuzzier, harder-to-quantify things, such as emotional flexibility, grit, social agility, and moral qualities.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">But of course all mental actions are cognitive. What this categorization method reveals is how little the rationalists care about the abilities that lie beyond IQ. The modern meritocracy treats the noncognitive realm the way the German planners treated the underbrush; it discounts it. But the putatively “noncognitive” skills can be more important than cognitive ones. Having a fast mental processor upstairs is great, but other traits may do more to determine how much you are going to contribute to society: Do you try hard? Can you build relationships? Are you curious? Are you trustworthy? How do you perform under pressure?</p> <aside class="ArticlePullquote_root__z11cW" data-flatplan-pullquote="true">The meritocracy as currently constituted seems to want you to be self-centered and manipulative. We put students in competitive classrooms, where the guiding questions are “How am I measuring up?” and “Where am I on the curve?”</aside> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The importance of noncognitive traits shows up everywhere. Chetty, the Harvard economist, <a href="http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/assets/documents/star_paper.pdf" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="3720639" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">wanted to understand the effect that good teachers have on their pupils</a>. He and his colleagues discovered that what may most differentiate good teachers is not necessarily their ability to produce higher math and reading scores. Rather, what the good teachers seem to impart most effectively are “soft skills”—how to get along with others, how to stay on task. In fact, the researchers found that these soft skills, when measured in the fourth grade, are 2.4 times more important than math and reading scores in predicting a student’s future income.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The organizational-leadership expert Mark Murphy discovered something similar when he studied why people get fired. In <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781259860904" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="3760372" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1"><i>Hiring for Attitude</i></a>, he reports that only 11 percent of the people who failed at their jobs—that is, were fired or got a bad performance review—did so because of insufficient technical competence. For the other 89 percent, the failures were due to social or moral traits that affected their job performance—sour temperament, uncoachability, low motivation, selfishness. They failed because they lacked the right noncognitive skills.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Murphy’s study tracked 20,000 new hires and found that 46 percent of them failed within 18 months. Given how painful and expensive it is for an organization to replace people, this is a cataclysmic result. Why aren’t firms better at spotting the right people? Why do we have such a distorted and incomplete view of what constitutes human ability?</p> <h3 class="ArticleLegacyHtml_root__WFd2I ArticleLegacyHtml_standard__kC_zi"><span class="smallcaps"><span class="caps">The Humanist Turn</span></span></h3> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span class="smallcaps">In reconceiving the</span> meritocracy, we need to take more account of these noncognitive traits. Our definition of ability shouldn’t be narrowly restricted to who can ace intelligence tests at age 18.

One observational study that followed four children between the ages of 14 months and 5 years found that they made an average of 107 inquiries an hour. Little kids ask tons of questions. Then they go to school, and the meritocracy does its best to stamp out their curiosity. In research for her book <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780674984110" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="3828272" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1"><i>The Hungry Mind</i></a>, the psychologist Susan Engel found that in kindergarten, students expressed curiosity only 2.4 times every two hours of class time. By fifth grade, that was down to 0.48 times.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">What happened? Although teachers like the idea of curiosity, our current system doesn’t allow it to blossom. A typical school wants its students to score well on standardized tests, which in turn causes the school to encourage teachers to march through a certain volume of content in each class period. If a student asks a question because she is curious about something, she threatens to take the class off course. Teachers learn to squelch such questions so the class can stay on task. In short, our current meritocracy discourages inquiry in favor of simply shoveling content with the goal of improving test scores. And when children have lost their curiosity by age 11, Engel believes, they tend to remain incurious for the rest of their life.</p> <p id="injected-recirculation-link-5" class="ArticleRelatedContentLink_root__VYc9V" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 6" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="6" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_217="4134138" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_217="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_217="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/01/lost-in-the-meritocracy/303672/">From the January/February 2005 issue: Lost in the meritocracy</a></p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">This matters. You can sometimes identify a bad leader by how few questions they ask; they think they already know everything they need to. In contrast, history’s great achievers tend to have an insatiable desire to learn. In his study of such accomplished creative figures, the psychologist Frank Barron found that abiding curiosity was essential to their success; their curiosity helped them stay flexible, innovative, and persistent.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Our meritocratic system encourages people to focus narrowly on cognitive tasks, but curiosity demands play and unstructured free time. If you want to understand how curious someone is, look at how they spend their leisure time.

Their sense that life had meaning, <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780807014271" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="4183438" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">Frankl concluded</a>, sustained them even in the most dehumanizing circumstances.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">A sense of meaning and commitment has value even in far less harrowing conditions. People with these qualities go to where the problems are. They’re willing to run through walls.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Some such people are driven by moral emotions—indignation at injustice, compassion for the weak, admiration for an ideal. They have a strong need for a life of purpose, a sense that what they are doing really matters. As Frankl recognized, people whose lives have a transcendent meaning or a higher cause have a sense of purpose that drives them forward. You can recognize such people because they have an internal unity—the way, say, the social-justice crusader Bryan Stevenson’s whole life has a moral coherence to it. Other people are passionate about the pursuit of knowledge or creating beautiful tools that improve life: Think of Albert Einstein’s lifelong devotion to understanding the universe, or Steve Jobs’s obsession with merging beauty and function.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">I once asked a tech CEO how he hires people.

In an effective meritocracy, we’d want to find people who are fantastic team builders, who have excellent communication and bonding skills. Coaches sometimes talk about certain athletes as “glue guys,” players who have that ineffable ability to make a team greater than the sum of its parts. This phenomenon has obvious analogies outside sports. <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w21473" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="4266500" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">The Harvard economist David Deming has shown</a> that across recent decades, the value of social skills—of being a workplace “glue guy”—has increased as a predictor of professional success, while the value of cognitive ability has modestly declined.</p> <p id="injected-recirculation-link-6" class="ArticleRelatedContentLink_root__VYc9V" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 7" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="7" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_217="4315082" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_217="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_217="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/12/legacy-admissions-inequality-elite-colleges/676233/">David Deming: The single biggest fix for inequality at elite colleges</a></p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The meritocracy as currently constituted seems to want you to be self-centered and manipulative.

If even one team member hogs airtime, that can impede the flow of interaction that teams need to be most effective.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Based on cognitive skills alone, Franklin D. Roosevelt, probably the greatest president of the 20th century, would never get into Harvard today. As Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. observed, he had only “a second-class intellect.” But that was paired, Holmes continued, with a “first-class temperament.” That temperament, not his IQ, gave Roosevelt the ability to rally a nation.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>Agility.</b> In chaotic situations, raw brainpower can be less important than sensitivity of perception. The ancient Greeks had a word, <i>metis</i>, that means having a practiced eye, the ability to synthesize all the different aspects of a situation and discern the flow of events—a kind of agility that enables people to anticipate what will come next. Academic knowledge of the sort measured by the SATs doesn’t confer this ability; inert book learning doesn’t necessarily translate into forecasting how complex situations will play out. <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780804136716" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="4356936" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">The University of Pennsylvania psychologist and political scientist Philip E. Tetlock has found</a> that experts are generally terrible at making predictions about future events. In fact, he’s found that the more prominent the expert, the less accurate their predictions. Tetlock says this is because experts’ views are too locked in—they use their knowledge to support false viewpoints. People with agility, by contrast, can switch among mindsets and riff through alternative perspectives until they find the one that best applies to a given situation.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Possessing agility helps you make good judgments in real time. The neuroscientist John Coates used to be a financial trader. During the bull-market surges that preceded big crashes, Coates noticed that the traders who went on to suffer huge losses had gotten overconfident in ways that were physically observable. They flexed their muscles and even walked differently, failing to understand the meaning of the testosterone they felt coursing through their bodies. Their “assessment of risk is replaced by judgments of certainty—they just know what is going to happen,” Coates writes in <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780143123408" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="4411151" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1"><i>The Hour Between Dog and Wolf</i></a>.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The traders, in other words, got swept up in an emotional cascade that warped their judgment. The ones who succeeded in avoiding big losses were not the ones with higher IQs but the ones who were more sensitively attuned to their surging testosterone and racing hearts, and were able to understand the meaning of those sensations. Good traders, Coates observes, “do not just process information, they feel it.”</p> <div class="ArticleInlineFigure_root__hYQJP ArticleInlineFigure_alignWell__tK_8_" data-flatplan-inline_image="true"> <figure class="ArticleInlineFigure_figure__qmYhH"><noscript><noscript><picture class="ArticleInlineImagePicture_picture__SVXJ7"></picture></noscript></noscript><amp-img data-hero class="Image_root__XxsOp Image_lazy__hYWHV ArticleInlineImagePicture_image__I79fR amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/f-5AHBPtTGiKoJvbeLaK2dXN0RE=/0x0:1600x1920/655x786/media/img/posts/2024/11/WEL_Brooks_MeritocracyFinger/original.png" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/f-5AHBPtTGiKoJvbeLaK2dXN0RE=/0x0:1600x1920/655x786/media/img/posts/2024/11/WEL_Brooks_MeritocracyFinger/original.png 655w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/QuCuIrluowtNc3jGiab6tJtfl-E=/0x0:1600x1920/750x900/media/img/posts/2024/11/WEL_Brooks_MeritocracyFinger/original.png 750w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/w_UQ5LPtwo73uDezs3iajtS81cg=/0x0:1600x1920/850x1020/media/img/posts/2024/11/WEL_Brooks_MeritocracyFinger/original.png 850w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Ig9QVDDXfgXjGOVafaw4wh04FZM=/0x0:1600x1920/928x1114/media/img/posts/2024/11/WEL_Brooks_MeritocracyFinger/original.png 928w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/zGgkI3VP67hwayRPBt57zqg2HKw=/0x0:1600x1920/1310x1572/media/img/posts/2024/11/WEL_Brooks_MeritocracyFinger/original.png 1310w" alt='photo-illustration of large red and white sports-fan foam hand with raised "#1" finger and "GOOD LUCK AT STATE" written on it' width="655" height="786" layout="intrinsic"><amp-img fallback data-hero class="Image_root__XxsOp Image_lazy__hYWHV ArticleInlineImagePicture_image__I79fR amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://www.ronperrier.net/wp-content/plugins/accelerated-mobile-pages/images/SD-default-image.png" srcset="https://www.ronperrier.net/wp-content/plugins/accelerated-mobile-pages/images/SD-default-image.png 655w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/QuCuIrluowtNc3jGiab6tJtfl-E=/0x0:1600x1920/750x900/media/img/posts/2024/11/WEL_Brooks_MeritocracyFinger/original.png 750w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/w_UQ5LPtwo73uDezs3iajtS81cg=/0x0:1600x1920/850x1020/media/img/posts/2024/11/WEL_Brooks_MeritocracyFinger/original.png 850w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Ig9QVDDXfgXjGOVafaw4wh04FZM=/0x0:1600x1920/928x1114/media/img/posts/2024/11/WEL_Brooks_MeritocracyFinger/original.png 928w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/zGgkI3VP67hwayRPBt57zqg2HKw=/0x0:1600x1920/1310x1572/media/img/posts/2024/11/WEL_Brooks_MeritocracyFinger/original.png 1310w" alt='photo-illustration of large red and white sports-fan foam hand with raised "#1" finger and "GOOD LUCK AT STATE" written on it' width="655" height="786" layout="intrinsic"></amp-img></amp-img><figcaption class="ArticleInlineFigure_figcaption__kxSCW ArticleInlineFigure_alignWell__tK_8_">Ricardo Rey</figcaption></figure>

<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The physicist and science writer Leonard Mlodinow puts the point more broadly. “While IQ scores may correlate to cognitive ability,” he writes in <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780525563181" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="4413632" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1"><i>Emotional: How Feelings Shape Our Thinking</i></a>, “control over and knowledge of one’s emotional state is what is most important for professional and personal success.”</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">If we can orient our meritocracy around a definition of human ability that takes more account of traits like motivation, generosity, sensitivity, and passion, then our schools, families, and workplaces will readjust in fundamental ways.</p> <h3 class="ArticleLegacyHtml_root__WFd2I ArticleLegacyHtml_standard__kC_zi"><span class="smallcaps">Rebuilding the Meritocracy</span></h3> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span class="smallcaps">When the education</span> scholars Jal Mehta and Sarah Fine toured America’s best high schools for their book,<i> <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780674248250" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="4413935" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">In Search of Deeper Learning</a></i>, they found that even at many of these top schools, most students spent the bulk of their day bored, disengaged, not learning; Mehta and Fine didn’t find much passionate engagement in classrooms. They did, however, find some in noncore electives and at the periphery of the schools—the debate team, the drama club, the a cappella groups, and other extracurriculars. During these activities, students were directing their own learning, teachers served as coaches, and progress was made in groups. The students had more agency, and felt a sense of purpose and community.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">As it happens, several types of schools are trying to make the entire school day look more like extracurriculars—where passion is aroused and teamwork is essential. Some of these schools are centered on “project-based learning,” in which students work together on real-world projects. The faculty-student relationships at such schools are more like the one between a master and an apprentice than that between a lecturer and a listener. To succeed, students must develop leadership skills and collaboration skills, as well as content knowledge. They learn to critique one another and exchange feedback. They teach one another, which is a powerful way to learn.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Mehta and Fine profiled one high school in a network of 14 project-based charter schools serving more than 5,000 students. The students are drawn by lottery, representing all social groups. They do not sit in rows taking notes. Rather, grouped into teams of 50, they work together on complicated interdisciplinary projects. Teachers serve as coaches and guides. At the school Mehta and Fine reported on, students collaborated on projects such as designing exhibits for local museums and composing cookbooks with recipes using local ingredients. At another project-based-learning school, High Tech High in San Diego, which is featured in <a href="https://www.whatschoolcouldbe.org/most-likely-to-succeed" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="4416399" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">the documentary <i>Most Likely to Succeed</i></a>, one group of students built a giant wooden model with gears and gizmos to demonstrate how civilizations rise and fall; another group made a film about how diseases get transmitted through the bloodstream.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In these project-based-learning programs, students have more autonomy. These schools allow students to blunder, to feel like they are lost and flailing—a feeling that is the predicate of creativity. Occasional failure is a feature of this approach; it cultivates resilience, persistence, and deeper understanding. Students also get to experience mastery, and the self-confidence that comes with tangible achievement.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Most important, the students get an education in what it feels like to be fully engaged in a project with others. Their school days are not consumed with preparing for standardized tests or getting lectured at, so their curiosity is enlarged, not extinguished. Of course, effective project-based learning requires effective teachers, and as a country we need to invest much more in teacher training and professional development at the elementary- and secondary-school levels. But emerging evidence suggests that the kids enrolled in project-based-learning programs tend to do just as well as, if not better than, their peers on standardized tests, despite not spending all their time preparing for them. This alone ought to convince parents—even, and perhaps especially, those parents imprisoned in the current elite college-competition mindset—that investing aggressively in project-based and other holistic learning approaches across American education is politically feasible.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW ArticleParagraph_dropcap__uIVzg" data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true"><span class="smallcaps">Building a school </span><span class="smallcaps">system </span>geared toward stimulating curiosity, passion, generosity, and sensitivity will require us to change the way we measure student progress and spot ability. Today we live in the world of the transcript—grades, test scores, awards. But a transcript doesn’t tell you if a student can lead a dialogue with others, or whether a kid is open-minded or closed-minded.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Helpfully, some of these project-based-learning schools are pioneering a different way to assess kids. Students don’t graduate with only report cards and test scores; they leave with an electronic portfolio of their best work—their papers, speeches, projects—which they can bring to prospective colleges and employers to illustrate the kind of work they are capable of. At some schools, students take part in “portfolio defenses,” comparable to a grad student’s dissertation defense.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The portfolio method enlarges our understanding of what assessment can look like. Roughly 400 high schools are now part of an organization called <a href="https://mastery.org/" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="4419398" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">the Mastery Transcript Consortium</a>, which uses an alternative assessment mechanism. Whereas a standard report card conveys how much a student knows relative to their classmates on a given date, the mastery transcript shows with much greater specificity how far the student has progressed toward mastering a given content area or skill set. Teachers can determine not only who’s doing well in math, but who’s developing proficiency in statistical reasoning or getting good at coming up with innovative experiment designs. The mastery report also includes broader life skills—who is good at building relationships, who is good at creative solutions.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">No single assessment can perfectly predict a person’s potential. The best we can do is combine assessment techniques: grades and portfolios, plus the various tests that scholars have come up with to measure noncognitive skills—<a href="https://angeladuckworth.com/grit-scale/" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="4420234" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">the Grit Scale</a>, <a href="https://furrrm.sites.wfu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Moral-Character-Questionnaire.pdf" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="4420237" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">the Moral Character Questionnaire</a>, social-and-emotional-learning assessments, <a href="https://explore.bps.org.uk/content/test-review/bpstest.2023.hpti" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="4420333" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">the High Potential Trait Indicator</a>. All of these can be informative, but what’s important is that none of them is too high-stakes. We are using these assessments to try to understand a person, not to rank her.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Data are good for measuring things, but for truly knowing people, stories are better. In an ideal world, high-school teachers, guidance counselors, and coaches would collaborate each year on, say, a five-page narrative about each student’s life. Some schools do this now, to great effect.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">College-admissions officers may not have time to carefully study a five-page narrative about each applicant, nor will every high-school teacher or college counselor have time to write one. But a set of tools and institutions is emerging that can help with this. In Australia, for example, some schools use something called <a href="https://www.bigpicture.org.au/" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="4420849" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">the Big Picture Learning Credential</a>, which evaluates the traits that students have developed in and out of the classroom—communication skills, goal setting, responsibility, self-awareness.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Creating a network of independent assessment centers in this country that use such tools could help students find the college or training program best suited to their core interests. The centers could help college-admissions officers find the students who are right for their institution. They could help employers find the right job applicants. In short, they could help everybody in the meritocracy make more informed decisions.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">These assessment methods would inevitably be less “objective” than an SAT or ACT score, but that’s partly the point. Our current system is built around standardization. Its designers wanted to create a system in which all human beings could be placed on a single scale, neatly arrayed along a single bell curve. As the education scholar Todd Rose writes in <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780062358370" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="4421901" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1"><i>The End of Average</i></a>, this system is built upon “the paradoxical assumption that you could understand individuals by ignoring their individuality.” The whole system says to young people: You should be the same as everyone else, only better. The reality is that there is no single scale we can use to measure human potential, or the capacity for effective leadership. We need an assessment system that prizes the individual over the system, which is what a personal biography and portfolio would give us—at least in a fuller way than a transcript does. The gatekeepers of a more effective meritocracy would ask not just “Should we accept or reject this applicant?” and “Who are the stars?” but also “What is each person great at, and how can we get them into the appropriate role?”</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW ArticleParagraph_dropcap__uIVzg" data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true"><span class="smallcaps">Anew, broader </span><span class="smallcaps">definition </span>of merit; wider adoption of project-based and similar types of learning; and more comprehensive kinds of assessments—even all of this together gets us only so far. To make the meritocracy better and fairer, we need to combine these measures with a national overhaul of what UCLA’s Joseph Fishkin calls the “opportunity structure,” the intersecting lattice of paths and hurdles that propel people toward one profession or way of life and away from others.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Right now, America’s opportunity structure is unitary. To reach commanding heights, you have to get excellent grades in high school, score well on standardized tests, go to college, and, in most cases, get a graduate degree. Along the way, you must navigate the various channels and bottlenecks that steer and constrain you.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Historically, when reformers have tried to make pathways to the elite more equal, they’ve taken the existing opportunity structure for granted, trying to give select individuals, or groups of individuals, a boost. This is what affirmative action did.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Fishkin argues that we need to refashion the opportunity structure itself, to accommodate new channels and create what he calls opportunity pluralism. “The goal needs to be to give people access to a broader range of paths they can pursue,” Fishkin writes in <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780199812141" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="4425265" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1"><i>Bottlenecks: A New Theory of Equal Opportunity</i></a>, “so that each of us is then able to decide—in a more autonomous way and from a richer set of choices—what combinations of things we actually want to try to do with our lives.”</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">With greater opportunity pluralism, the gatekeepers will have less power and the individuals striving within the structure will have more. If the meritocracy had more channels, society would no longer look like a pyramid, with a tiny, exclusive peak at the top; it would look like a mountain range, with many peaks. Status and recognition in such a society would be more broadly distributed, diminishing populist resentment and making cultural cohesion more likely.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">As a social ideal to guide our new meritocracy, we could do worse than opportunity pluralism. It aspires to generate not <i>equal</i> opportunity but <i>maximum</i> opportunity, a wide-enough array of pathways to suit every living soul.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Achieving that ideal will require a multifaceted strategy, starting with the basic redefinition of merit itself. Some of the policy levers we might pull include reviving vocational education, making national service mandatory, creating social-capital programs, and developing a smarter industrial policy.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Let’s consider vocational education first. From 1989 to 2016, every single American president took measures to reform education and prepare students for the postindustrial “jobs of the future.” This caused standardized testing to blossom further while vocational education, technical education, and shop class withered. As a result, we no longer have enough skilled workers to staff our factories. Schools should prepare people to build things, not just to think things.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Second, yes, trotting out national service as a solution to this or that social ailment has become a cliché. But a true national-service program would yield substantial benefits. Raj Chetty and his colleagues have found that cross-class friendships—relationships between people from different economic strata—powerfully boost social mobility. Making national service a rite of passage after high school might also help shift how status gets allocated among various job categories.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Third, heretical though this may sound, we should aim to shrink the cultural significance of school in American society. By age 18, <a href="https://www.naesp.org/sites/default/files/resources/2/Principal/2004/S-Op6.pdf" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="4430634" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">Americans have spent only 13 percent of their time in school</a>. Piles of research across 60 years have suggested that neighborhoods, peers, and family background may have a greater influence on a person’s educational success than the quality of their school. Let’s invest more in local civic groups, so a greater number of kids can grow up in neighborhoods with community organizations where they can succeed at nonacademic endeavors—serving others, leading meetings, rallying neighbors for a cause.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Fourth, although sending manufacturing jobs overseas may have pleased the efficiency-loving market, if we want to live in an economy that rewards a diversity of skills, then we should support economic policies, such as <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/09/fact-sheet-chips-and-science-act-will-lower-costs-create-jobs-strengthen-supply-chains-and-counter-china/" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="4430865" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">the CHIPS and Science Act</a>, that boost the industrial sector.

We want a society run by people who are smart, yes, but who are also wise, perceptive, curious, caring, resilient, and committed to the common good. If we can figure out how to select for people’s motivation to grow and learn across their whole lifespan, then we are sorting people by a quality that is more democratically distributed, a quality that people can control and develop, and we will end up with a fairer and more mobile society.</p> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In 1910, <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781596058491" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="4431467" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">the U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands wrote a book</a> in which he said: “The Spirit of America is best known in Europe by one of its qualities—<i>energy</i>.” What you assess is what you end up selecting for and producing. We should want to create a meritocracy that selects for energy and initiative as much as for brainpower. After all, what’s really at the core of a person? Is your IQ the most important thing about you? No. I would submit that it’s your desires—what you are interested in, what you love. We want a meritocracy that will help each person identify, nurture, and pursue the ruling passion of their soul.</p> <hr class="ArticleLegacyHtml_root__WFd2I ArticleLegacyHtml_standard__kC_zi"> <p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><small><i>This article appears in the </i><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/toc/2024/12/" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="4431616" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1"><i>December 2024</i></a><i> print edition with the headline “How the Ivy League Broke America.” When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.
