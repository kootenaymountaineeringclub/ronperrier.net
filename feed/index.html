										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel’s war in Gaza has killed tens of thousands of civilians in the wake of Hamas’ brutal attacks on October 7<sup>th</sup>. Still, a different area in the region, the West Bank, is home to over 3,000,000 Palestinians, cluding the eastern half of Jerusalem, as well as some of the holiest sites for Christians, Jews and Muslims. Gaza has overshadowed the West Bank, but it is a critical part of the larger struggle between Israelis and Palestinians. Everything concerning the West Bank and Israel’s occupation of it is incredibly contentious to the point that even small decisions concerning it can cause headlines.</p>
<p>A key reason the West Bank is so tense concerns the hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers living there. While that tension can be expressed at the international level or by proxy, it can also be communicated face to face, as in this viral video from a few years ago in which a Palestinian woman confronts the Israeli settler who was living in the family home that she&#8217;d been forcibly evicted from, “Jacobi, you know this is not your house. You are stealing my house.”  It is both ridiculous and tragic that this woman&#8217;s only recourse against the man occupying her home is yelling at him. The ousting of that woman from her home in East Jerusalem is just a microcosm of the larger issue of Palestinian displacement and Israeli settlements in the West Bank.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s happening there is essential to understand, both because it&#8217;s inextricably linked to the fate of any possible peace process and because things there have recently deteriorated exponentially. Let&#8217;s discuss the West Bank settlements &#8211; how they came to be, who lives there, and what their presence means for everyone in the region.</p>
<p>Here is a brief overview of how we arrived at this point. Very basically, Israel was founded in 1948, fulfilling the long-held hopes of the Zionist movement at a time when Jews were reeling from the collective traumas of persecution and genocide in the Holocaust. It was established through what Israel calls &#8220;the war of independence&#8221; and what Palestinians refer to as the Nakba or catastrophe. 700,000 Palestinians suffered their own collective trauma when they fled or were driven out of their homes amid violence and, in some cases, massacres of entire villages. Some ended up in neighbouring countries as refugees, while others settled in the part of Palestine, now known as Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
<p>For decades, there were significant tensions between Israel and its neighbours, and then came the Six-Day War in 1967, where Israel defeated Egypt, Syria and Jordan, and in doing so, captured vastly more territory, including the West Bank. Almost immediately, it started building settlements there while also annexing East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>To be clear, both those actions constitute violations of international law. When you occupy territory as an outcome of war, you are not allowed to expel people or move your own citizens in. Israel knew this at the time. Its foreign ministry&#8217;s own legal adviser warned in a top-secret memo that the civilian settlements would contravene explicit provisions of the 4th Geneva Convention. Still, they built settlements anyway and continued to do so for decades.</p>
<p>There was a moment in the 1990s when it seemed there might be a possible pathway to a peaceful resolution, as outlined in the Oslo Accords. That historic peace process gave a new framework for the West Bank, dividing it into three distinct areas. Area A gave Palestinians total control over security and government, Area B was designated for Palestinian government control while retaining Israeli security control, meaning the Israeli military remains very present, and Area C remained completely under the Israeli army and government control. That’s about 60% of the West Bank, and that is what the West Bank map looks like today.</p>
<p>That is one of the most politically fraught areas on earth, colour-coded away, that looks like what would happen if Shrek just fell into a puddle. Crucially, this entire setup was only meant to be temporary while a larger peace deal was negotiated. But after Oslo fell apart for reasons including, but not limited to, continued settlement expansion and terror attacks by Palestinian militants. Israeli hardliners assassinated the Prime Minister who brokered the deal, Yitzhak Rabin. That temporary arrangement was basically frozen in place, and Israel continued building more and more and more settlements. In fact, every Israeli government has invested significant resources in expanding them, and all of that has brought us to where we are today. There were approximately 250,000 settlers in the West Bank when the Oslo Accords were signed, and there are currently around 700,000.</p>
<p>Talking about the settlers themselves, because when you think of them, you may envision someone like the blundering guy you saw earlier or hardliners on an ideological mission to claim the Holy Land in the name of the Jewish people. But that is not the whole picture. In fact, 70% of those who live in the West Bank are so-called quality-of-life settlers. The way they describe their communities does make them seem very attractive. Spend 10 minutes in a settlement today, and you sometimes feel that you could just as easily be in a New Jersey suburb &#8211; clean roads, big houses, quality parks, good schools, close-by shopping, a university. You ask people why they moved out here, and instead of the original mission to push forward the Israeli state, you hear things like a perfect educational system and a very nice Country Club. “It&#8217;s a great place to raise kids. We were looking for a Jerusalem suburb that we could afford, which had a manageable commute. The quality of life is so much better. It has nothing to do with politics.”</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with politics! I&#8217;m sorry, but it does very much. Just because it&#8217;s a nice place to live doesn&#8217;t make it any less illegal under international law. It&#8217;s not like the Geneva Convention says the occupying power shall not transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies unless there&#8217;s really convenient shopping and a super manageable commute to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Additionally, part of the reason settlements can be so pleasant is that the government encourages people to move there. Life is massively subsidized in the settlement, with the government spending more per capita on things like education and infrastructure in them than it does within Israel itself. In recent years, the housing ministry has even offered subsidized apartments in the West Bank through a lottery system. The whole settlement project has been massively encouraged by the Israeli government to such a degree that it is hard to argue that living in one isn&#8217;t a political choice. Building on stolen land is an inherently political act. It is also, by the way, a form of copyright infringement.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth now, the Israeli government will say that it doesn&#8217;t officially support all settlements. Its official line is that there are two different kinds &#8211; so-called legally approved settlements, and outposts created by rogue settlers that are illegal under Israeli law. However, for the record, under international law, both are illegal. Also, Israel frequently offers all manner of resources to the so-called unlawful outpost, to provide them with military defence, access to public utilities, and sometimes even retroactively legalizing them.</p>
<p>Therefore, as this is particularly critical, the settlements point out that the line between the two types can become quite blurry. Settlement or outpost, what&#8217;s the difference? Well, usually someone refers to Israeli settlements, which the Israeli government officially approves, and there are outposts or Israeli settlements which had been built also by the Israeli government, but without official approval. Settlements and outposts usually are different, but can look strikingly similar.</p>
<p>But some sectors will insist that none of this matters because all they&#8217;re really doing is building in areas that no one&#8217;s using. “I know for sure that when we came here, we did not think anybody left because I saw that there was nobody here. No, it was the whole thing, there was still nobody around it, nobody was using it, nobody was bothering anybody.” But it doesn&#8217;t matter if anyone was using it if it&#8217;s not your land. You can&#8217;t just take it, and I do know that it is hard to take from someone using this particular accent, but there is a clear difference between property that nobody is using and property that nobody owns. That’s why we call those big things outside of stores parking lots and not help yourself car buffets. The argument is clearly ridiculous.</p>
<p>It also speaks to Israel&#8217;s larger strategy in the region, as one of the official means by which Israel acquires land is by claiming that if land hasn&#8217;t been cultivated within the prior three years, it can be declared state land. Tactics seem designed to ensure a lack of cultivation as sellers have driven Palestinians off their land through violence or intimidation. Also, it can be hard for Palestinians in the West Bank to build or cultivate in the first place due to the opaque permit process. There was this man patiently explaining, “It’s tough, the lenders then used anyway this on the top of the hills, that&#8217;s good, but why is it not news because we are not allowed to use it?”</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not exaggerating that Israel controls building permits in the West Bank, and by its own admission, it rejects over 95% of Palestinian permit requests. So it was not that the Palestinians don&#8217;t want to use the land, but that they are frequently not allowed to. Ultimately, it&#8217;s not their choice. I want this to be that, even as Israel has been heavily incentivizing construction for Israelis in the West Bank. When it comes to Palestinian homes, this is what&#8217;s been happening for years. Authorities have ordered hundreds of Palestinian homes to be demolished because they were built without the proper permits, which were almost impossible for Palestinians to get. They cost thousands of dollars, can take years to process and rarely get approved, which means Palestinians often build illegally, of course. Another shocking event, even before you get to the brain-destroying hypocrisy of Palestinians in the West Bank being told that their homes are illegal.</p>
<p>But building powers are just the tip of the iceberg. There are also the physical obstacles placed in the path of Palestinian’s everyday life, from this massive winding separation wall to the endless maze of checkpoints and gates Palestinians are forced to pass through. As this man points out, it can have extreme consequences: “You can&#8217;t come to my house, you know, the checkpoint, they close it at night. It&#8217;s only on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, with one hour in the morning and one hour in the evening. We are allowed to pass a checkpoint, no visitors, no importance, it’s no kindergartens, no schools, no jobs, there&#8217;s an emergency, what do you do?” Nothing by holy fuck. In some situations, all you can do is sit there and wait to die, like if you&#8217;re stranded on a desert island or travelling on a Boeing aeroplane.</p>
<p>But there shouldn&#8217;t be an inevitable outcome just because you happen to live behind an Israeli checkpoint. These checkpoints are a nightmare. Palestinian women trying to get to the hospital to give birth have been delayed at them so many times that there&#8217;ve been dozens of documented roadside births, as well as cases of maternal and infant deaths. And these delays are inconveniences that can be deliberate, sometimes strategically placed to cut Palestinian communities off from one another. One outpost placed in a commercial hub openly declares on its Facebook page that its location intends to disrupt contiguity between three Palestinian villages.</p>
<p>The way Palestinians are fenced in can get truly absurd. One home sits on his ancestral land, surrounded by this imposing metal fence &#8211; a house within a cage encircled by Israeli settlements. His 11-year-old son Sabri was detained for six hours when his football rolled near the settlement’s boundary. He springs with youthful bravado, claiming he wasn&#8217;t scared, but his sister pipes up &#8220;Yeah&#8221;, but she was. Everything about that is bonkers, from the idea of living in a house almost surrounded by a military fence to a childhood that includes the possibility that a stray football could land you in detention for six hours. What on earth is the point of detaining an 11-year-old for six hours when you’re really hoping to get out of questioning because that is all they talk about. There&#8217;s a good reason for that girl to be scared because the legal rights of Palestinians in the West Bank are tenuous at best.</p>
<p>There are actually two sets of laws that Jewish settlers enjoy: access to civilian law, due process, and complete protection of civil rights. Palestinians live under Israeli military law, so if they&#8217;re accused of a crime, they are tried in military courts, which, to put it mildly, have significantly fewer protections, and that clearly separates them. An unequal two-tier justice system means Palestinians also have little recourse when they&#8217;re the victims of the crime because, despite both Israeli and international law say Israeli soldiers have an obligation to protect Palestinian residents of the West Bank, in practice, when it comes to attacks by settlers on Palestinians, there has been a history of silence, avoidance, and abatement by Israeli officials. In fact, when an Israeli human rights group looked at more than 1600 cases of settler violence, it found that just 3% resulted in a conviction. Still, 3% is too low and presented just how extreme settlements can be. Take Deborah, a city home to about 200,000 Palestinians and 700 hardline Israeli settlers have chosen to live literally above them. Life in heaven is full of constant reminders about whose safety is prioritized. Just over a year ago, a remotely controlled gun, reportedly for crowd dispersal, was installed above this checkpoint.</p>
<p>The Palestinian authorities have had to build an overhead fence to catch rubbish and projectiles thrown down by settlers. “Yeah, yeah, I did throw everything down.” Twelve shops are closed. The settlers attack Palestinians without any accountability. I feel very sad &#8211; from the most beautiful market to closed shops and outposts. For me, it illustrates that it&#8217;s really Tyler, someone from the settlement above his, throwing a beer bottle at his head. So, I got a piercing, or maybe it cut you, that&#8217;s terrible. I&#8217;m not sure which part of that situation seems less livable &#8211; saying hello to the barrel of a remote-control turret every day or the constant weather forecast of cloudy with a chance of tetanus.</p>
<p>Settlers will argue that they live in constant fear of violence. It is true that over the last 16 years, 150 Israelis have been killed by Palestinians in the West Bank, though it is worth noting that in that same period,, Israelis have killed <span style="font-family: arial;">more than 10 times </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Palestinians, the vast majority directly by Israeli security forces.</span></p>
<p>Maybe the clearest illustration of the impunity some settlers feel is the practice of so-called price tag attacks on Palestinians, which were sensible acts of revenge but can be utterly indiscriminate, as this settler calmly explains. “Can you explain to us where these price tag attacks are, what they mean, the after-hours rules and anything wrong that happened? We showed that we won&#8217;t stay quiet. It has a price, and it&#8217;s called a price tag. It could just be any random error; it doesn&#8217;t matter whether they&#8217;re involved enough. It doesn&#8217;t matter because they sit here and believe it&#8217;s theirs, and they’re all involved. And for you, that&#8217;s guilty enough. Just being here makes them guilty, yeah, yeah, that makes them guilty.” It&#8217;s a bit jarring to hear someone say something so wildly disturbing in such a sedate manner. She&#8217;s advocating for random violent hate crimes.</p>
<p>It is a truly horrendous situation, as what you saw earlier points out, is actually a term that describes all this cautious torture when two groups live in the same territory. They&#8217;re officially separated in terms of political, economic, and legal rights. The key to this separation is entirely arbitrary, whether you were born to an Arab mother or not. What would you call it if it smells like apartheid, looks like apartheid, sounds like apartheid, then it&#8217;s apartheid. He&#8217;s right, although, if it smells like a boxer, does apartheid actually have a smell? Until now, I was pretty sure it only produced one type of Musk. He&#8217;s not alone in the assessment. Former head of Israel&#8217;s intelligence agency Mossad has referred to the West Bank as an apartheid state. This former general has called the situation total apartheid, adding that the IDF is standing by, looking at the settlers and is beginning to be a partner in war crimes.</p>
<p>We should discuss the USA&#8217;s role in this situation, as it is considerable. America opposes settlements officially, but very much soft pedals its criticism of them. Both Republican and Democratic presidents have referred to them as illegitimate but declined to call them illegal to avoid the possibility that Israel would face international sanctions. Some presidents have gone even further.</p>
<p>Trump was incredibly cozy with Netanyahu, as you can tell from the unnervingly smug look on Beebe’s face. His administration not only moved the US embassy to Jerusalem in 2018, an incredibly provocative act in itself, but also made a significant change in foreign policy the following year. The Trump administration said it no longer considers Jewish communities built on Palestinian lands known as settlements to be against international law. The announcement made by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling the establishment of civilian settlements inconsistent with international law hasn&#8217;t worked; it hasn&#8217;t advanced the cause of peace. It turns out Mike Pompeo and I actually agree on something. The status quo hasn&#8217;t worked. I think we might disagree on what to do next is one of the many things that we seem to disagree on, along with what he should have named his book, because, in my opinion, “Never Give an Inch” sounds like the autobiography of a micro penis, but Mike clearly feels differently.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not just government support that wealthy American individuals funnelled hundreds of millions of dollars into settlements. It&#8217;s worth noting that many of Israel’s strongest advocates aren&#8217;t Jewish individuals or groups; they&#8217;re actually evangelical Christians, like this man, pastor Jon Hagey, who&#8217;s done more than you might expect. Pastor Hagey founded Christians United for Israel, which is the largest pro-Israel lobbying organization in America, even bigger than the organization most people assume dominates the American Israel lobby. A good deal of their money for Israel is spent on buildings and organizations in the Israeli settlements gave him that land they owned by OK if you told me to picture a mega church pastor, that is precisely who I&#8217;m imagining swings back silver hair, headset mic looking like an elderly Chris Farley and Easter pimp drag that is on the nose casting right there.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the reason many evangelicals are so invested in Israel is that they believe Jewish people being in that region is one of the prerequisites for their vision of Armageddon when that day comes. The thinking goes, Christians will be raptured, and I&#8217;ll let this man fill you in on what he thinks happens to Jews in Israel. “After 1000 years, blindness is welcome peeling off the Jewish mind and those of us that with Jesus who to the Christians have been raptured out all who are born again Jesus company called from you in the air yeah and then we will come with panoramic thing unfolding as the Jewish people turned their Messiah would be converting people by the hundreds of thousands during this time. It&#8217;s gonna be the best of times and the worst of times.” Yeah, that makes sense. Apparently, evangelicals will grow Victoria&#8217;s Secret Angel wings, flap up to Jesus, and sit with him in his Lisa Frank ball gown and smugly watch as Jews realize how wrong they&#8217;ve been.</p>
<p>On one hand, I get why some in Israel might encourage this. There was a cynical utility to taking idiots&#8217; money. Still, someone expressing anticipation for the day 2000 years of blindness come wheeling off my mind might make me wanna keep a certain distance from them, and yet what is Hagey? A few years ago, I introduced a special guest star to his followers. Would you please welcome my friend and the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu? “Thank you, pastor Hagey, you are always there for us. We have no better friends on earth. You, I guess, that makes sense. Some friends drive you to the airport, others see your suffering as their ticket to getting Christ blasted by a flying Raptor. Jesus’ friendship takes many forms.</p>
<p>And in recent years, everything I&#8217;ve shown you has only gotten worse in 2022. Benjamin Netanyahu, to hold on to power from the governing coalition by allying with leaders of far-right parties, created the most right-wing government in Israel’s history, putting extremist politicians, some of whom have set themselves in significant positions of power. His current finance minister openly advocates for Israeli annexation of the West Bank, and his minister of national security lives in Hebron, you know, the fun place with the flying bottles and remote-control machine guns. He&#8217;s also been convicted of incitement to racism and supporting a terrorist organization. All this was a massive win for hardline settlers. Just listen to this Israeli soldier gloating to Palestinians in Hebron about what Ben’s assent would mean. “And your actions are illegal is a bull shit attitude, it’s the sort of thing an American cop would only be comfortable tattooing above their sleeve, like things were already getting bad.</p>
<p>And then the appalling attacks of October 7th happened, and since then, things have gotten considerably worse. Israel imposed even tighter restrictions on Palestinian movement in the West Bank. The checkpoints are increasingly closed, and many work permits were cancelled, making it impossible for many Palestinians there to make a living. Meanwhile, attacks on Palestinians have only spiked from where they were already at a historic high to the point that the UN has found at least 19 entire Palestinian communities have been displaced as a direct result of settler violence since October. In the midst of all of this, nearly four square miles of Palestinian territory were declared to be state land, the single largest land grab since the Oslo Accords. Is it any wonder that Israeli security chiefs have warned that the West Bank could be on the brink of a major eruption of violence?</p>
<p>And when you take all of this together, you do begin to understand why so many Israelis and Palestinians have despaired of ever achieving a two-state solution, as this seller pointed out nearly a decade ago. “That is basically the whole strategy. You can kiss the two-state solution goodbye. It&#8217;s not going to happen. We&#8217;re going to continue to move in there, and eventually we&#8217;re going to have more Jewish communities there, more Israeli electricity, more Israeli roads, more Israeli taxes. And then in the end, it&#8217;s just going to be Israel.” Relentless expansion has made the idea of peace talks a joke, and when I say joke, I don&#8217;t mean something funny, ha-ha. I mean something deeply depressing. You know a joke in the same way that this show is a comedy, which, as this audience that was excited to be in here half an hour ago will tell you, is stretching that turn to breaking point.</p>
<p>Where do we go from here? At this point, it feels presumptuous even to discuss a peace process, as we&#8217;re so far from being in a position even to begin. There&#8217;s actually a moment that I think sums that up pretty well. It&#8217;s the then-mayor of Ramallah speaking to a German delegation a few years ago. They asked him if he&#8217;d be willing to participate in some symbolic exchanges with his Israeli counterparts to demonstrate goodwill and help facilitate peace &#8211; you know, the standard &#8216;meet them in the middle&#8217; rhetoric. And this incredibly diplomatic response. “When we feel that we are not treated as enslaved people and they are masters, we are ready to do everything. But when I have to take off all my clothes in front of all the people because a soldier of 16 years old is asking me to do so under the threat of his weapon, then it&#8217;s about dignity. Yeah, and when it comes to dignity, I think it&#8217;s something negotiated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Human dignity has to be a prerequisite for negotiating anything, and Palestinians in the West Bank have their dignity challenged hundreds of times a day, from having beer bottles thrown over their heads to being detained for kicking balls. The offences have been stopped while crossing checkpoints in ambulances, to having their home stolen, bulldozed and far worse. To be clear, dignity is the absolute starting point of what&#8217;s required for justice, and the call for that is growing louder. Just last week, the ICJ issued an opinion that Israeli settlements and the regime associated with them violate international law. Israeli presence in the occupied territories should come to an end as rapidly as possible.</p>
<p>That is why it has an obligation to provide full reparation for the damage it caused. However, the US State Department has already undermined that statement, stating that it&#8217;s concerned the breadth of the ICJ&#8217;s opinion will complicate efforts to resolve the conflict. However, the conflict is already quite complicated. Is the world’s highest court interpreting international law accurately, really going to make things any worse?</p>
<p>A phrase that gets thrown up a lot about Israel is “never again”, an anti-genocide slogan often invoked in memory of the Holocaust. It&#8217;s always been open to two interpretations. There&#8217;s the one that means this must never again happen to the Jewish people. And that means this must never happen to any people anywhere again. In the West Bank, as in Gaza right now, it couldn&#8217;t be clearer which one the Israeli government has favoured, especially as long as Netanyahu is in power. He&#8217;s clearly going to do whatever he and the worst people around him want.</p>
<p>But the US doesn&#8217;t have to continue to abet that or cover for it. The thing is, we do have levers at our disposal. We could put conditions on the billions in military aid we give Israel. We could stop vetoing UN Security Council resolutions critical of the Israeli government&#8217;s actions, which we&#8217;ve been doing for decades now. We can say what is painful. Everyone can see these settlements aren&#8217;t just illegitimate or even just illegal; they are immoral. Not only should we say that, we should then act accordingly. I know the bar here is incredibly low, but at the very least, I want my government to have the moral backbone that Ben and Jerry’s are showing.</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.ronperrier.net/2025/08/28/the-west-bank-john-oliver/">THE WEST BANK – John Oliver</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.ronperrier.net">only where you have walked have you been</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW ArticleParagraph_dropcap__uIVzg" data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">L<span class="smallcaps">ast summer</span>, I got a tip about a curious scientific finding. “I’m sorry, it cracks me up every time I think about this,” my tipster said.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Back in 2018, a Harvard doctoral student named Andres Ardisson Korat was presenting his research on the relationship between dairy foods and chronic disease to his thesis committee. One of his studies had led him to an unusual conclusion: Among diabetics, eating half a cup of ice cream a day was associated with a lower risk of heart problems. Needless to say, the idea that a dessert loaded with saturated fat and sugar might actually be good for you raised some eyebrows at the nation’s most influential department of nutrition.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Earlier, the department chair, Frank Hu, had instructed Ardisson Korat to conduct further investigation: Could his research have been led astray by an artifact of chance, a hidden source of bias, or a computational error? As Ardisson Korat spelled out on the day of his defense, his debunking efforts had been largely futile. The ice-cream signal was robust.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">It was robust and hilarious. “I do sort of remember the vibe being like, <i>Hahaha, this ice-cream thing won’t go away; that’s pretty funny</i>,” recalled my tipster, who’d attended the presentation. This was obviously not what a budding nutrition expert or his super-credentialed committee members were hoping to discover. “He and his committee had done, like, every type of analysis—they had thrown every possible test at this finding to try to make it go away. And there was nothing they could do to make it go away.”</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Spurious effects emerge frequently in science, particularly in fields such as nutritional epidemiology, where the health concerns and dietary habits of hundreds of thousands of people are monitored over years. Still, the abject silliness of “healthy ice cream” intrigued me. As a public health historian, I’ve studied how teams of researchers process data, integrate it with theory, and then package the results as “what the science says.” I wanted to know what happens when consensus makers are confronted with a finding that seems to contradict everything they’ve ever said before. (Harvard’s Nutrition Source website calls ice cream an “indulgent” dairy food that is considered an “every-so-often” treat.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">“There are a few plausible biological explanations for these results,” Ardisson Korat wrote in the brief discussion of his “unexpected” finding in his thesis. Something else grabbed my attention, though: The dissertation explained that he’d hardly been the first to observe the shimmer of a health halo around ice cream. Several prior studies, he suggested, had come across a similar effect. Eager to learn more, I reached out to Ardisson Korat for an interview—I emailed him four times—but never heard back. When I contacted Tufts University, where he now works as a scientist, a press aide told me he was “not available for this.” Inevitably, my curiosity took on a different shade: Why wouldn’t a young scientist want to talk with me about his research? How much deeper could this bizarre ice-cream thing go?</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW ArticleParagraph_dropcap__uIVzg" data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span class="smallcaps">“I still </span>to this day don’t have an answer for it,” Mark A. Pereira, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, told me, speaking of the association he’d stumbled upon more than 20 years earlier. “We analyzed the hell out of the data.”</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Just that morning, I’d been reading one of Pereira’s early papers, on the health effects of eating dairy, because it seemed to have inspired other research that was cited in Ardisson Korat’s dissertation. But when I scrolled to the bottom of Pereira’s article, down past the headline-making conclusions, I saw in Table 5 a set of numbers that made me gasp.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">At the time, Pereira was a young assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. Hoping to address the newly labelled epidemics of obesity and diabetes, he initially focused his research on physical activity, but soon turned to the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/07/how-junk-food-can-end-obesity/309396/" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="1439988" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">unsettled science of healthy eating</a>. The status of dairy, in particular, was hindered by simplistic and competing assumptions. “We just thought, <i>Oh, you know, calcium and bones: It’s good for kids. But, oh, the saturated fat! Don’t eat too much dairy! </i>”</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Pereira and his co-authors tested these old ideas using data from a study, begun in 1985, that tracked the emergence of heart-disease risk factors in more than 5,000 young adults. After seeing the results, “we knew it was going to be very high-profile and controversial,” Pereira recalled. Pretty much across the board—low-fat, high-fat, milk, cheese—dairy foods appeared to help prevent overweight people from developing insulin-resistance syndrome, a precursor to diabetes. “I’ll tell you, this study surprised the heck out of me,” said one CNN correspondent, as Pereira’s study spiralled through the press.</span></p>
<aside class="ArticlePullquote_root__z11cW" data-flatplan-pullquote="true"><span style="font-size: 18px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The Harvard group didn’t like the ice-cream finding: It seemed wrong.</span></aside>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">But the international media coverage didn’t mention what I’d seen in Table 5. According to the numbers, tucking into a “dairy-based dessert”—a category that included foods such as pudding but consisted, according to Pereira, mainly of ice cream—was associated with dramatically reduced odds of developing insulin-resistance syndrome for overweight people. It was by far the most significant effect seen in the study, 2.5 times the size of what they’d found for milk. “It was pretty astounding,” Pereira told me. “We thought a lot about it, because we thought, <i>could this actually be the case? </i>”</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">There were reasons to be wary: The data set wasn’t huge, in epidemiological terms, and participants hadn’t reported eating that many dairy-based desserts, so the margin of error was wide. And given that the study’s overall message was sure to attract criticism—Pereira recalled getting “skewered” by antidairy activists—he had little desire to make a fuss about ice cream.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Pretty soon, Pereira’s peers found themselves in the same predicament. Building on the 2002 study and the growing interest in dairy, researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health decided to break out some of their most powerful tools. Since the 1980s, Harvard scientists have been collecting “food-frequency questionnaires” and medical data from thousands of nurses, dentists, and other healthcare workers. These world-famous studies have fueled a stream of influential findings, including some of the data that <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/reader/10.1177/0270467611422837" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="1442072" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">sparked the removal of trans fats</a> from the food supply.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The results of Harvard’s first observational study on dairy and type 2 diabetes were published<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/1152788" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="1442169" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1"> in 2005</a>. Based on data collected from just one of their three cohorts, following men between 1986 and 1998, the authors reported that higher dairy intake, and higher low-fat-dairy intake in particular, was associated with a lower risk of diabetes. “The risk reduction was almost exclusively associated with low-fat or non-fat dairy foods,” a Harvard news bulletin explained. An <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/story/milk-may-help-keep-diabetes-away.amp" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="1442367" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">article on Fox News’s website</a> underscored the low-fat message: “There was no decrease in men who drank whole milk,” the story said.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Perhaps not whole milk, but what about butter pecan? Near the end of the Harvard paper, where the authors had arrayed the diabetes risks associated with various dairy foods, was a finding that was barely mentioned in the “almost exclusively” low-fat narrative given to reporters. Yes, according to that table, men who consumed two or more servings of skim or low-fat milk a day had a 22 percent lower risk of diabetes. However, so did men who consumed two or more servings of ice cream per week. Once again, the data suggested that ice cream might be the strongest diabetes prophylactic in the dairy aisle. Yet, no one seemed to want to discuss it.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">In the years that followed, research summaries <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ejcn201162" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="1443168" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">generally agreed</a> that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2950929/" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="1443186" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">high dairy intake overall</a> was <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/98/4/1066/4577090" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="1443202" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">associated</a> with a slightly reduced risk of diabetes. Still, they called for further investigation into which specific dairy foods might offer the most significant benefits. In 2014, Harvard’s nutrition team brought another dozen years of diet-tracking data to bear on this question. In this new study, total dairy consumption now appeared to have no effect, but the ice cream signal was impossible to miss. Visible across hundreds of thousands of subjects, it all but screamed for more attention.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Following a pattern of incredulousness that was by then more than a decade old, Frank Hu, the study’s senior author and the future chair of Harvard’s nutrition department, asked the graduate student who’d led the project, Mu Chen, to double-check the data. “We were very skeptical,” Hu told me. Chen, who is no longer in academia, did not respond to interview requests, but Hu recalled that no errors in the data could be found.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW ArticleParagraph_dropcap__uIVzg" data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span class="smallcaps">The Harvard researchers </span>didn’t like the ice-cream finding: It seemed wrong. However, the same paper had provided them with another result that they liked much better. The team was going all in on yogurt. With a growing reputation as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/19/magazine/say-hello-to-the-100-trillion-bacteria-that-make-up-your-microbiome.html?ref=magazine" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="1444193" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">a boon for microbiomes</a>, yogurt was the anti-ice-cream—the healthy person’s dairy treat.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">“Higher intake of yogurt is associated with a reduced risk” of type 2 diabetes, “whereas other dairy foods and consumption of total dairy are not,” the 2014 paper said. “The conclusions weren’t exactly accurate,” acknowledged Dariush Mozaffarian, the dean of policy at Tufts’s nutrition school and a co-author of the paper, when he revisited the data with me in an interview. “Saying no foods were associated—ice cream was associated.”</span></p>
<aside class="ArticlePullquote_root__z11cW" data-flatplan-pullquote="true"><span style="font-size: 18px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">One scientist said that the ice-cream effect was “similar” in magnitude to, or “slightly stronger” than, the one for yogurt.</span></aside>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">But yogurt made so much more sense. In a way, it was confirmation of something that everyone already knew. From the start of yogurt’s entrée into the American diet, it had been perceived as <a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/gastronomica/article-abstract/16/4/66/44994/Live-and-Active-Cultures-Gender-Ethnicity-and" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="1445036" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">an exotic food</a> from a faraway land, quivering with vague health-giving properties. Even after being <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/21270426/yogurt-america-chobani-fage-skyr" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="1445085" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">s</a>weetened with sugar in the 1970s and 1980s to suit the U.S. market better, yogurt still retained its image as an elixir.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Furthermore, a growing body of literature suggests that yogurt’s health benefits might be real. Harvard researchers had found, a few years earlier, that eating yogurt was associated with reduced weight gain; they were also interested in its possible effects on gut bacteria. Other studies—including those that first revealed the ice-cream signal—had also sketched the slender outlines of a yogurt effect. When Chen and Hu combined the findings from this research with their latest data and performed a meta-analysis, they concluded that yogurt was indeed associated with a reduced risk of diabetes—a potential benefit, they wrote, that warranted further study.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Regarding the potential benefits of ice cream, they had much less to say. I asked other experts to compare the 2014 findings on yogurt and ice cream. Kevin Klatt, a nutrition scientist at UC Berkeley, said the ice-cream effect was “more consistent” than yogurt across the studied cohorts. Deirdre Tobias, an epidemiologist at Harvard, the academic editor of <i>The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</i>, and a member of the advisory committee for the 2025 update to the U.S. dietary guidelines, agreed with that assessment. Even Dagfinn Aune, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London and a peer reviewer of the Chen and Hu paper, said that the ice-cream effect was “similar” in magnitude to, or “slightly stronger” than, the one for yogurt.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">So, how did the Harvard team explain away the ice cream finding? The theory went like this: Perhaps some of the people in the study had developed health problems, such as high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol, and began avoiding ice cream at the doctor’s orders (or on their own initiative). Meanwhile, people who didn’t have those health problems would have had less reason to give up their cookies and cream. In that scenario, it wouldn’t be that ice cream causes diabetes, but rather that being at risk of developing diabetes causes people to avoid eating ice cream. Epidemiologists refer to this as “reverse causation.”</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">To test this idea, Hu and his co-authors set aside dietary data collected after people received these types of diagnoses and then recalculated their result<a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-014-0215-1/tables/5" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="1446736" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">s</a>. The ice-cream effect shrank by half, although it was still statistically significant and larger than the low-fat-dairy effect that Harvard <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=QMY_AAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=harvard+dairy+2005+diabetes+hu&amp;article_id=5404,2118431&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiB0rW-n7b9AhXEGVkFHZe0DIEQ6AF6BAgEEAI#v=onepage&amp;q=harvard%20dairy%202005%20diabetes%20hu&amp;f=false" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="1446801" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">had publicized in 2005</a>. In any event, if people who received adverse diagnoses cut back on their ice cream, you might expect that they’d also cut back on, say, cake and doughnuts. So shouldn’t there be mysterious protective “effects” for cake and doughnuts, too? “There should be,” Mozaffarian said. “That’s why the finding for ice cream is intriguing.”</span></p>
<p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" class="ArticleRelatedContentLink_root__VYc9V" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_217="1447058" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_217="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_217="1"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/08/ice-cream-military/535980/">Read: How ice cream helped America at war.</a></span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The new analysis was hardly a slam dunk. On paper, the yogurt and ice cream effects still looked similar. “Within the realm of statistical uncertainty, they’re identical,” Mozaffarian told me. But in the 2014 paper, he and the other authors had argued that “reverse causation may explain the findings” for ice cream. And as academia’s public-relations machinery came to life, nuance went out the window.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">“Does a yogurt a day keep diabetes away?” asked the <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/11/141125074836.htm" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="1447935" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">press release</a> that went out on publication day. “Other dairy foods and consumption of total dairy did not show this association,” said Hu, the senior author, in an ice-cream-free appraisal included in the release and <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/newsplus/yogurt-may-reduce-type-2-diabetes-risk/" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="1448052" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">echoed</a> in Harvard’s own press bulletin. “Yogurt has approached wonder-food status in recent years,” a <i>Forbes</i> article on the paper noted. “In the new study, other forms of dairy, like milk and cheese, did not offer the same kind of protection as yogurt.”</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Hu says that today, the Harvard researchers feel confident in their conclusions about yogurt primarily due to their meta-analysis, as well as the fact that prior clinical studies and basic science research supported the idea that probiotics improve metabolic outcomes. “For ice cream, of course, there is no prior literature,” he said. Given that the ice-cream effect was diminished when they tested their reverse-causation theory, he called it “much more plausible” that yogurt would help prevent diabetes than ice cream.</span></p>

<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">After his paper was published, it didn’t take long for the Harvard group’s good news about yogurt to take hold as a dominant scientific narrative. Two years later, when a team of researchers based in the Netherlands and at Harvard analyzed all the available evidence on dairy and diabetes, the yogurt effect emerged. A featured graph from the team’s 2016 paper in <i>The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</i> summarizes data from about a dozen studies: As someone’s yogurt intake increases to roughly one-third of a cup a day, their risk of developing diabetes decreases by 14 percent.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The authors also found the ice cream effect: consuming as little as half a cup per week was associated with a 19 percent reduced risk of diabetes. But that finding’s epitaph was already written. The researchers concluded that consuming “dairy foods, particularly yogurt,” might help curb the diabetes epidemic, and noted that the benefits of ice cream had previously been dismissed as a product of reverse causation. The evidence in yogurt’s favour was much better established, Sabita Soedamah-Muthu, an epidemiologist at Tilburg University and the paper’s senior author, told me. The ice-cream effect had fewer studies in its corner. “We didn’t believe in it,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW ArticleParagraph_dropcap__uIVzg" data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span class="smallcaps">There’s a thing </span>that happens when you start writing a story about how, maybe, possibly, believe it or not, ice cream might be sort of good for you, and how some of the world’s top nutritionists gathered evidence supporting that hypothesis but found reasons to look past it. You begin to ask yourself: Am I high on my own supply of ice cream? I asked the experts for a gut check. Pereira, the first to hit upon the ice-cream effect, told me that it just wasn’t the kind of result that goes down well in the “closed-minded” world of elite nutrition. “They don’t want to see it. They might ponder it for a second and kind of chuckle and not believe it,” he said. “I think that’s related to how much the field of nutritional epidemiology in the modern era is steeped in dogma.” Tobias, the journal editor and member of the 2025 U.S. dietary guidelines advisory committee, called it “totally fair criticism” to ask why yogurt was played up while ice cream was played down. She expressed support for the Harvard team’s handling of the data, while acknowledging the tensions involved: “You don’t want to overstate stuff that you know probably has a high likelihood of bias, but you also don’t want to do the opposite and seem to be burying it, either.”</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Hu, the Harvard nutritionist, said that deciding what a study means requires looking beyond the numbers to what is already known about dietary science: “You need to interpret the data in the context of the rest of the literature.” Mozaffarian, Hu’s co-author, echoed this view. Still, he noted, “you’re raising a really, really important point, which is that when, as scientists, we find things that don’t fit our hypotheses, we shouldn’t just dismiss them. We should step back and say, ‘You know, could this actually be true?’ ”</span></p>
<aside class="ArticlePullquote_root__z11cW" data-flatplan-pullquote="true"><span style="font-size: 18px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Once you start contemplating all the ways that cultural biases can seep into science, it doesn’t stop at dairy-based desserts.</span></aside>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Could</i> the idea that ice cream is metabolically protective be accurate? It would be pretty bonkers. Still, there are at least a few points in its favour. For one, ice cream’s <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load-for-100-foods" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="1452685" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">glycemic index</a>, a measure of how rapidly a food boosts blood sugar, is lower than that of brown rice. “There’s this perception that ice cream is unhealthy, but it’s got fat, it’s got protein, it’s got vitamins. It’s better for you than bread,” Mozaffarian said. “Given how horrible the American diet is, it’s very possible that if somebody eats ice cream and eats less starch … it could actually protect against diabetes.” The “Got Milk?” crowd also loves to talk about the “milk-fat-globule membrane,” a triple-layered biological envelope that encases the fat in mammalian milk. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/102/1/20/4564341" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="1452936" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">Some evidence suggests</a> that dairy products in which the membrane is intact, such as ice cream, are more metabolically neutral than foods like butter, where it’s lost during the churn. (That said, regular cream has an intact membrane, and it hasn’t been consistently associated with a reduced diabetes risk.)</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Then there is what might charitably be termed the “real-world evidence.” In 2017, the YouTuber Anthony Howard-Crow launched <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/weight-loss/a19546608/ice-cream-diet-32-lb-weight-loss/" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="1453332" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">what <i>Men’s Health</i> called</a> “a diet that would make the American Dietetic Association shit bricks”: 2,000 calories a day of ice cream plus 500 calories of protein supplements plus booze. After 100 days on the ice-cream diet, he’d lost 32 pounds and had better blood work than before he’d started pounding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49810W13yDE&amp;ab_channel=Abs%26IceCream" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="1453452" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">Irish-whiskey milkshakes</a>. Still, the method is unlikely to take the slimming world by storm: Howard-Crow called his ice-cream bender “the most miserable dieting adventure I have ever embarked upon.”</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">However, overall, I found more receptiveness to the ice cream signal than I had expected. “It’s been more or less replicated,” Pereira noted. “Whether it’s causal or not remains an open question.” Mozaffarian agreed: “I think probably the ice cream is still reverse causation,” he said. “But I’m not sure, and I’m kind of annoyed by that.” If this had been a patented drug, he continued, “you can bet that the company would have done a $30 million randomized controlled trial to see if ice cream prevents diabetes.”</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">To be clear, none of the experts interviewed for this article is inclined to believe that the ice-cream effect is real, although sometimes for reasons that differ from Hu’s. Pereira, for example, pointed out that people aren’t always truthful when they’re quizzed on what they eat. His 2002 study found that overweight and obese people reported eating fewer dairy-based desserts than other people. “I don’t believe that the heavier people consume fewer desserts,” he said. “I believe they underreport more.” If that’s true, then admitting to eating ice cream might correlate with metabolic health—and the ice-cream effect would be, in its way, a marker of fat stigma in America.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The problem with this line of thinking is that once you start contemplating all the ways that cultural biases can seep into the science, it doesn’t stop at dairy-based desserts. If the ice-cream effect can be set aside, how should we think about other signals produced by the same research tools? “I don’t know what I believe about yogurt,” Tobias told me. It’s widely known that yogurt eaters, on average, are healthier, leaner, wealthier, better educated, more physically active, more likely to read labels, more likely to be female, and less likely to smoke or drink or eat Big Macs than never-yogurters. “You can’t confidently adjust away all of that kind of stuff,” said Klatt, the UC Berkeley nutritionist.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">In 2004, the English epidemiologist Michael Marmot wrote, “Scientific findings do not fall on blank minds that get made up as a result. Science engages with busy minds that have strong views about how things are and ought to be.” Marmot was writing about how politicians deal with scientific evidence—always concluding that the latest data supported their existing views—but he acknowledged that scientists weren’t so different.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The ice cream saga illustrates how this plays out in practice. Many stories can be told about any given scientific inquiry, and choosing one is a messy, value-laden process. A scientist may worry about how their story aligns with common sense and whether they have sufficient evidence to support it. They may also fear that it poses a threat to public health or to their credibility. If there’s a lesson to be drawn from the parable of the diet world’s most inconvenient truth, it’s that scientific knowledge is itself a packaged good. The data, whatever they show, are just ingredients.</span></p>

Yet the ownership rate in the other two – Guatemala and Mexico – is almost a tenth of the United States.</span></p>

<p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph-01a39979944f9ce75186f4e07bc9207c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">A decade of gun violence, culminating with the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, prompted the Australian government to take action.</span></p>
<p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph-aad2ae2bf67742c8b2601a271a13b01d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Less than two weeks after Australia’s worst mass shooting, the federal government implemented a new program, banning rapid-fire rifles and shotguns, and unifying gun owner licensing and registrations across the country. In the next 10 years gun deaths in Australia fell by more than 50%. A 2010 study found the government’s 1997 buyback program – part of the overall reform – led to an average drop in firearm suicide rates of 74% in the five years that followed.</span></p>
<p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph-b8bd03cba9b2cfcff0ecdc0b19c74292@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Other countries are also showing promising results after changing their gun laws. In South Africa, gun-related deaths almost halved over a 10-year-period after new gun legislation, the Firearms Control Act of 2000, went into force in July 2004. The new laws made it much more difficult to obtain a firearm.</span></p>
<p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph-240dd1962d78a0e219a5fe0ebf7dff80@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">In New Zealand, gun laws were swiftly amended after the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings. Just 24 hours after the attack, in which 51 people were killed, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced that the law would change. New Zealand’s parliament voted almost unanimously to change the country’s gun laws less than a month later, banning all military-style semi-automatic weapons.</span></p>
<p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph-d8f405200f2bd2e8eb64fbcc0034d8a2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Britain tightened its gun laws and banned most private handgun ownership after a mass shooting in 1996, a move that saw gun deaths drop by almost a quarter over a decade. In August 2021, a licensed firearms holder killed five people in Plymouth, England, marking the worst mass shooting since 2010. After the incident, police said the gunman’s firearm license had been returned to him just months after it was revoked, due to assault accusations. The British government then asked police to review their licensing practices and said that they would be bringing forward new guidance to improve background procedures, including social media checks.</span></p>
<p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph-12de31d4bf9d5877b5c183c3d1c4ab1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Many countries around the world have been able to tackle gun violence. Yet, despite the thousands of lost lives in the US, only around half of US adults favor stricter gun laws, according to the recent Pew survey, and political reform remains at a standstill. The deadly cycle of violence seems destined to continue.</span></p>

<p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph-bc46753c002b4c3b971b2d2f95f97431@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">For gun ownership rates, CNN relied on the Small Arms Survey (SAS), a project of the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, Switzerland. It estimates civilian arm stocks using a combination of gun sales and registration figures, public surveys, expert estimates and cross-country comparisons. The gun ownership rate per 100 people is not the same as the share of people that own guns, as some may own multiple guns and others may own none.</span></p>
<p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph-bff005116754a23cad1151975a9a583c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">For firearm deaths totals and rates, CNN used the Global Burden of Disease database compiled by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington. Firearm-related deaths include physical violence (homicide), self-harm (suicide) and unintentional injuries. While rates are preferable for cross-country comparisons, in the case of suicides we illustrated the totals to highlight the gap between the US and other countries.</span></p>
<p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph-8b4ae6e8fd6692c24f9eaf9f878c8afd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">When comparing US statistics with other developed countries we used a UN definition found in the United Nations’ World Economic Situation and Prospects report – which intends “to reflect basic economic country conditions” and is not strictly aligned with the UN Statistics Division’s classification known as M49.</span></p>
<p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph-298be3ca00372d17d28b330f14e86298@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">To estimate numbers on mass shootings, including incidents, fatalities, and injuries in the US, CNN typically relies on data from the Gun Violence Archive. To enable international comparisons for this story, we also used data compiled by Jason R. Silva, an assistant professor of sociology and criminal justice at William Paterson University. Silva’s definition is narrower than CNN and the GVA’s because it excludes incidents involving profit-driven criminal activity, familicide and state-sponsored violence.</span></p>

<section class="ArticleBody_root__2gF81" data-event-module="article body" data-flatplan-body="true">
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Christine Rousseau learned the hard way that pharmacies in Paris do <em>not</em> always sell diapers. She had run out while on vacation, and her 2-year-old son desperately needed to be put down for a nap. So in the rain, wearing heels, the clock ticking toward a messy and imminent deadline, she hopped on an electric rental scooter that she did not know how to ride. Every place she tried seemed to have fancy face creams but no diapers. She didn’t know the French word to ask for them. This situation was not <em>très chic</em>—but then, family trips don’t tend to be.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Some would argue that the point of a vacation is to subtract, not add, stress. But like many parents of young kids, Rousseau is committed to traveling with her family—not only for her and her husband’s sake, but also for the sake of her children, now 7 and 3. She loves seeing them learn, and traveling provides abundant opportunity. In Paris, when the streets seemed empty of toddlers, she got to explain that many young kids there attend <em>crèches</em>, or state-subsidized day care. In London, her son inquired why the streets were so much cleaner than the streets back home in Brooklyn, and that prompted a lesson about civics and city funding. Breaking her kids out of their bubble, she told me, “helps them be more aware that their normal may not be everybody’s normal.”</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Rousseau, like most parents of young children today, is a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/27/millennials-are-turning-40-and-theyre-changing-travel-as-we-know-it.html" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="6754" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">Millennial</a>: part of a generation known for its love of travel and its tendency to <a href="https://www.traveltek.com/blog/millennials-travel-habits/#:~:text=Travel%20Spending%20and%20Duration,days%20of%20travel%20per%20year." data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="6769" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">spend a lot</a> on it. This cohort came of age as flights were becoming more accessible and homeownership less so. In place of stability, many Millennials came to prize adventure; travel became not just a simple luxury but an alternative source of meaning and identity. One 2024 Vox Media <a href="https://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/state-of-travel-survey-2024" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="6888" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">poll</a> found that 76 percent of the Zoomers and Millennials surveyed agreed that travel says “a lot about who they are”; 88 percent said it had spurred their personal growth. “For previous generations, travel was a status symbol,” Jennie Germann Molz, a College of the Holy Cross sociologist, told me. “For the Millennial generation it’s more about self-improvement or self-actualization.”</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">As more and more Millennials have started families, many of them are determined to pass down those globe-trotting values—to share the joy of journeying but also to shape their kids into adaptable, savvy people. Sometimes they’re spending money they don’t have; frequently, they’re sacrificing tranquility they may already be short on. In the era of intensive parenting, vacation has turned into something that many parents need a vacation <em>from</em>.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">For generations, parents have aspired to show their children more of the world—and, in the process, to bring their family closer, Susan Rugh, a Brigham Young University historian and the author of </span><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780700617593" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="7668" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1"><em>Are We There Yet? The Golden Age of American Family Vacations</em></a><span style="font-family: arial;">, told me. Of course, traveling as a unit has always been somewhat chaotic. When she was a kid, her parents took her and her six siblings on road trips—and back then, highway rest stops were rare. They had to carry all the food they were going to need for the whole excursion. But the inconvenience was kind of the point: Your family was a team, encountering obstacles on a shared adventure. “Even if there’s a lot of stress,” she told me, “it’s a memory of being together”—being stressed together, that is.</p>
<p></span>Today’s young parents, though, might be taking that tradition to a new level. One 2018 AAA <a href="https://newsroom.aaa.com/2018/03/move-baby-boomers-millennials-embrace-family-travel/#:~:text=(March%2015%2C%202018)%20%E2%80%93,baby%20boomers%20(32%20percent)." data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="8402" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">poll</a> found that 44 percent of American Millennials surveyed were planning a family trip—more than Gen Xers, who, on average, have older children and more resources. The pandemic slowed that jet-setting, but not for long. A 2022 Family Travel Association <a href="https://www.travelagewest.com/Travel/Family-Travel/family-travel-trends-fta-survey" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="8586" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">survey</a> found that 85 percent of parents said they were very likely to travel with their children in the next 12 months—a reflection of people coming out of isolation and wanting to live life to the fullest, Heike Schänzel, a tourism professor at the Auckland University of Technology, told me. The rise of remote work, she said, has also led to more casual travel even when kids are on board. And the FTA poll found that 76 percent of respondents wanted to travel internationally with their children. Parents aren’t just piling their kids into the car and driving a few hours to Grandma’s house. They’re paying thousands of dollars to rock screaming babies on a nine-hour flight; transporting a 25-pound stroller across an ocean; trekking children to an exciting restaurant with unfamiliar food just to find that the children still want dinosaur chicken nuggets.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">That trouble, for many parents, feels worth the reward. Even vacation is no longer spared from what the sociologist Annette Lareau, in her 2003 book <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780520271425" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="9238" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1"><em>Unequal Childhoods</em></a>, calls “concerted cultivation”: caregivers’ attempts to shape their child’s development and set them up for future success. Such efforts are at the core of intensive parenting, which rose in popularity among the American middle class in the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/05/intensive-helicopter-parent-anxiety/629813/" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="9369" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">mid-to-late 20th century</a>; inequality was growing, manufacturing jobs were disappearing, and parents started worrying that their children might never reach financial stability—not without their careful and constant hand. Now a similar uncertainty drives many parents to take their kids abroad, Germann Molz, the Holy Cross sociologist, told me. For her book <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781479834075" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="9637" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1"><em>The World Is Our Classroom: Extreme Parenting and the Rise of Worldschooling</em></a>, she interviewed people who homeschool their children on the go, the idea being that those children can learn more from travel than they would from a textbook. Theirs is a dramatic version of a common perspective: “Who knows what the labor market’s gonna look like?” Molz said, describing their thinking. “Who knows where we’ll be with the environment?” She told me these parents hope that, if the kids are well traveled, “they’ll be able to deal with change. They’ll be able to communicate with people from very different backgrounds from themselves. They’ll have this ability to move and travel with ease.&#8221;</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The modern family vacation, then, is ever more ambitious and goal-oriented—something Duncan Greenfield-Turk, the CEO of a boutique travel agency, told me he sees a lot of lately. Recently, a couple of his Millennial clients took their two kids, who were 9 and 11, to southern Africa for a trip focused on “humanitarian awareness”; the goal was for the children to understand how the lodges in which they were staying were part of the local economy. Another family took their kids to Okinawa, Japan, to get their children thinking about the impact of American influence and imperialism. For a lot of parents, he said, the “intention is very much trying to instill this sense of connection with the rest of the world.”</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial;">Traveling really can be good for kids. Children benefit from lots of diverse stimuli: new sights, sounds, ways to play. Being introduced to different cultures and customs can foster empathy and emotional intelligence. When things go wrong—the flight gets delayed, the Airbnb code won’t work—children can learn flexibility, competence, and patience. And studies suggest that vacations tend to </span><a href="https://scholarworks.indianapolis.iu.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/65819766-2c7f-4c60-abb8-560f109c40ad/content#:~:text=Participants%20repeatedly%20stated%20that%20family,patience%20and%20tolerance%20for%20others%2C" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="11474" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">strengthen</a><span style="font-family: arial;"> relationships among family members and contribute to a sense of </span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271931188_Family_Vacation_Activities_and_Family_Cohesion" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="11521" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">family cohesion</a><span style="font-family: arial;">. If the kids are old enough, Daniel Weisberg, a child psychologist in the United Kingdom, told me, they also tend to make long-lasting memories on family trips. One sweet, mundane moment can serve for decades as a “psychological anchor of positivity”: a token of past happiness and connection that one can think back to in tougher times.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Family vacations can make lovely memories for adults too, even if those trips involve more dirty diapers than daiquiris by the beach. Rousseau told me that some of her most treasured travel moments involved activities that she never would have chosen had she not had kids—but that, in exploring a new environment through their eyes and seeing how thrilled they were, she ended up having the time of her life. She has also, with her kids in tow, had to improvise often—to practice letting go of control and focusing on what matters. On some trips, she has left the books and toys behind, instead telling her children stories about the people in the free airline magazine. When her son was little, she once put a potato-chip bag inside his shoe; for 30 minutes, the crinkling sound of the wrapper kept him joyfully occupied.</p>

<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">However creative parents get, though, few of these experiences abroad come cheaply. Intensive parenting is easier for ultra-wealthy caregivers to accomplish, but it might in some ways be especially enticing to less-affluent parents—the ones who worry about their children’s financial futures, who want so badly to give them an extra boost but who don’t have the funds or the flexible work schedules for travel. Lots of Americans, with or without kids, are going on vacations they absolutely cannot afford: In March, Bankrate, a consumer financial-services company, <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/credit-cards/news/survey-summer-vacation/" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="13285" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">surveyed</a> more than 2,000 U.S. adults and found that 29 percent of all respondents said they were planning to take on debt to travel this summer. Compared with other generations, Millennial participants were most interested in travel, most likely to say they couldn’t afford it, and most likely to say they were willing to take on debt for vacation—which no doubt becomes even more expensive the more children they bring along.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Giving kids the world doesn’t actually require <em>showing</em> them the world, though. Simply being exposed to another culture a week out of every year won’t transform a child into someone sensitive, conscientious, and accepting—nor will visiting foreign museums and restaurants make them a sophisticated cultural consumer. A parent might put everything into flying their 4-year-old to a new city only to find that the kid wants to stay at the hotel and watch their iPad. When I spoke with Greenfield-Turk, he told me that one of his clients was on a trip to France and Portugal. The whole point had been to introduce the kids to different foods and traditions—but they were struggling with the richness of the foods and the amount of activity. They kept getting sick. Children are children, wherever you take them.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">There’s nothing wrong with vacations that are hard but rewarding—except that parenthood tends to be hard but rewarding 24/7. At some point, caregivers need actual relaxation. Even Rousseau, when I asked her if she craves a child-free, drink-on-the-beach-type trip, told me without hesitation: “Every single day, yes.” For leisure travel to be described so often as a source of purpose, a path to cultural awareness, a mind-opening exercise—that’s both perfectly legitimate and a testament to the reach of productivity culture. Nothing, it seems, is safe from the pressure to self-optimize, from the creep of guilt for being an imperfect parent and human being.</p>

<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">What kids tend to love most about traveling, anyway, can be found without going far at all. Parents can just keep an eye out for what Weisberg called “micro-adventures”: taking the bus to a free museum, driving two hours to a relative’s home, playing in the woods. Kids need novelty, yes—but when you’re new to existence, everything is new to you. Once, Rousseau’s family had a pileup of snafus trying to get from Amsterdam to Paris; they spent a whole day in the airport just to learn that their flight had been canceled. But as Rousseau and her husband were despairing, they realized that their toddler was having the time of his life: going up and down the escalator, watching the planes take off, marveling at how cool it is that people get to fly in the sky. <em>You have it right</em>, she felt like telling him. <em>I am grumpy. I have forgotten the beauty of the world</em>.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Rousseau had told me this story to illustrate the importance of family travel—how it takes everyone out of their separate routines and petty frustrations and plops them in the present moment together. She also ended up making the opposite point, though: that the long-awaited destination turned out not to be needed at all. Her kid was filled with wonder right where he happened to be.</p>

But this summer, at an influential megachurch in Northern Virginia, something went badly wrong. A trio of elders didn’t receive 75 percent of the vote, the threshold necessary to be installed.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“A small group of people, inside and outside this church, coordinated a divisive effort to use disinformation in order to persuade others to vote these men down as part of a broader effort to take control of this church,” David Platt, a 43-year-old minister at McLean Bible Church and a best-selling author, charged in a <a href="https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DxY2sdEf7bgY%26t%3D1969s&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cdskeel%40law.upenn.edu%7Ccf2810b8178a449b5c8608d95461c9f5%7C6cf568beb84a4e319df6359907586b27%7C1%7C0%7C637633601247550835%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=nGQTc67XDroMGWasaeIAVJFa7Av6Zm5WRAEudxDDmDE%3D&amp;reserved=0" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="3408201" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">July 4 sermon</a>.</p>

In a second vote on July 18, all three nominees cleared the threshold. But that hardly resolved the conflict. Members of the church filed a lawsuit, claiming that the conduct of the election violated the church’s constitution.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Platt, who is theologically conservative, had been accused in the months before the vote by a small but zealous group within his church of “wokeness” and being “<a href="https://christiannewsnow.com/david-platt-and-mclean-bible-church-elders-sued-after-recent-elder-vote-exposes-major-problems/" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="3409032" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">left of center</a>,” of pushing a “social justice” agenda and promoting critical race theory, and of attempting to “purge conservative members.” A <a href="https://www.facebook.com/savemcleanbiblechurch/" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="3409132" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">Facebook page</a> and a <a href="https://capstonereport.com/2021/07/19/the-lord-will-have-final-say-not-david-platt-say-mbc-conservatives/36655/" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="3409133" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">right-wing website</a> have targeted Platt and his leadership.

<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“Nearly everyone tells me there is at the very least a small group in nearly every evangelical church complaining and agitating against teaching or policies that aren’t sufficiently conservative or anti-woke,” a pastor and prominent figure within the evangelical world told me. (Like others with whom I spoke about this topic, he requested anonymity in order to speak candidly.) “It’s everywhere.”</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Michael O. Emerson, a sociology professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, told me that he and his research team have spent the past three years studying race and Christianity. “The divisions and conflicts we found are intense, easily more intense than I have seen in my 25 years of studying the topic,” he told me. What this adds up to, he said, is “an emerging day of reckoning within churches.”</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The aggressive, disruptive, and unforgiving mindset that characterizes so much of our politics has found a home in many American churches. As a person of the Christian faith who has spent most of my adult life attending <a href="https://www.nae.net/what-is-an-evangelical/" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="3411451" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">evangelical churches</a>, I wanted to understand the splintering of churches, communities, and relationships. I reached out to dozens of pastors, theologians, academics, and historians, as well as a seminary president and people involved in campus ministry. All voiced concern.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The coronavirus pandemic, of course, has placed religious communities under extraordinary strain. Everyone in America has felt its effects; for many Christians, it’s been a bar to gathering and worshipping together, sharing Communion and performing baptisms, and saying common prayers and participating in rituals and liturgy. Not being in community destabilized what has long been a core sense of Christian identity.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">But there’s more to the fractures than just COVID-19. After all, many of the forces that are splitting churches were in motion well before the pandemic hit. The pandemic exposed and exacerbated weaknesses and vulnerabilities, habits of mind and heart, that already existed.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The root of the discord lies in the fact that many Christians have embraced the worst aspects of our culture and our politics. When the Christian faith is politicized, churches become repositories not of grace but of grievances, places where tribal identities are reinforced, where fears are nurtured, and where aggression and nastiness are sacralized. The result is not only wounding the nation; it’s having a devastating impact on the Christian faith.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW ArticleParagraph_dropcap__uIVzg" data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true">H<span class="smallcaps">ow is it that evangelical</span> Christianity has become, for too many of its adherents, a political religion? The historian George Marsden told me that political loyalties can sometimes be so strong that they create a religiouslike faith that overrides or even transforms a more traditional religious faith. The United States has largely avoided the most virulent expressions of such political religions. None has succeeded for very long—at least, until now.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The first step was the cultivation of the idea within the religious right that certain political positions were deeply Christian, according to Marsden. Still, such claims were not at all unprecedented in American history. Through the 2000s, even though the religious right drew its energy from the culture wars—as it had for decades—it abided by some civil restraints. Then came Donald Trump.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“When Trump was able to add open hatred and resentments to the political-religious stance of ‘true believers,’ it crossed a line,” Marsden said. “Tribal instincts seem to have become overwhelming.” The dominance of political religion over professed religion is seen in how, for many, the loyalty to Trump became a blind allegiance. The result is that many Christian followers of Trump “have come to see a gospel of hatreds, resentments, vilifications, put-downs, and insults as expressions of their Christianity, for which they too should be willing to fight.”</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Tim Schultz, the president of the 1st Amendment Partnership and an advocate for religious freedom, told me that evangelicalism was due a reckoning. “It has been held together by political orientation and sociology more than by common theology,” he said. The twin crises of the summer of 2020—COVID and a heightened awareness of enduring racial injustices—exposed this long-unnoticed truth.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Some of the most distinctive features of the evangelical movement may have left it particularly vulnerable to this form of politicization. Among religious believers, evangelicals are some of the most anti-institutional, Timothy J. Keller, the founding pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church, in Manhattan, told me. The evangelical movement flourished in this relatively anti-institutional country at a particularly anti-institutional time. Evangelical ministries and churches fit the “spirit of the age,” growing rapidly in the 1970s, and retaining more of their members even as many mainline denominations declined.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">At the same time, Keller argues, that anti-institutional tendency makes evangelical communities more prone than others to “insider abuse”—corruption committed by leaders who have almost no guardrails—and “outsider-ism,” in which evangelicals simply refuse to let their church form them or their beliefs. As a result, they are unrooted—and therefore susceptible to political idolization, fanatical ideas, and conspiracy theories.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“What we’re seeing is massive discipleship failure caused by massive catechesis failure,” James Ernest, the vice president and editor in chief at Eerdmans, a publisher of religious books, told me. Ernest was one of several figures I spoke with who pointed to catechism, the process of instructing and informing people through teaching, as the source of the problem. “The evangelical Church in the U.S. over the last five decades has failed to form its adherents into disciples. So there is a great hollowness. All that was needed to cause the implosion that we have seen was a sufficiently provocative stimulus. And that stimulus came.”</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“Culture catechizes,” Alan Jacobs, a distinguished professor of humanities in the honors program at Baylor University, told me. Culture teaches us what matters and what views we should take about what matters. Our current political culture, Jacobs argued, has multiple technologies and platforms for catechizing—television, radio, Facebook, Twitter, and podcasts among them. People who want to be connected to their political tribe—the people they think are like them, the people they think are on their side—subject themselves to its catechesis all day long, every single day, hour after hour after hour.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">On the flip side, many churches aren’t interested in catechesis at all. They focus instead on entertainment, because entertainment is what keeps people in their seats and coins in the offering plate. But as Jacobs points out, even those pastors who really are committed to catechesis get to spend, on average, less than an hour a week teaching their people. Sermons are short. Only some churchgoers attend adult-education classes, and even fewer attend Bible study and small groups. Cable news, however, is always on. “So if people are getting one kind of catechesis for half an hour per week,” Jacobs asked, “and another for dozens of hours per week, which one do you think will win out?”</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">That’s not a problem limited to the faithful on one side of the aisle. “This is true of both the Christian left and the Christian right,” Jacobs said. “People come to believe what they are most thoroughly and intensively catechized to believe, and that catechesis comes not from the churches but from the media they consume, or rather the media that consume them. The churches have barely better than a snowball’s chance in hell of shaping most people’s lives.”</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">But when people’s values are shaped by the media they consume, rather than by their religious leaders and communities, that has consequences. “What all those media want is engagement, and engagement is most reliably driven by anger and hatred,” Jacobs argued. “They make bank when we hate each other. And so that hatred migrates into the Church, which doesn’t have the resources to resist it. The real miracle here is that even so, in the mercy of God, many people do find their way to places of real love of God and neighbor.”</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW ArticleParagraph_dropcap__uIVzg" data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true">T<span class="smallcaps">he way our sensibilities</span> are shaped determines who we are, including the order of our loves. For many Christians, their politics has become more of an identity marker than their faith. They might insist that they are interpreting their politics through the prism of scripture, with the former subordinate to the latter, but in fact scripture and biblical ethics are often distorted to fit their politics.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Scott Dudley, the senior pastor at Bellevue Presbyterian Church in Bellevue, Washington, refers to this as “our idolatry of politics.” He’s heard of many congregants leaving their church because it didn’t match their politics, he told me, but has never once heard of someone changing their politics because it didn’t match their church’s teaching. He often tells his congregation that if the Bible doesn’t challenge your politics at least occasionally, you’re not really paying attention to the Hebrew scriptures or the New Testament. The reality, however, is that a lot of people, especially in this era, will leave a church if their political views are ever challenged, even around the edges.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“Many people are much more committed to their politics than to what the Bible actually says,” Dudley said. “We have failed not only to teach people the whole of scripture, but we have also failed to help them think biblically. We have failed to teach them that sometimes scripture is most useful when it doesn’t say what we want it to say, because then it is correcting us.”</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Teaching people how to think biblically would help, Dudley added, as well as teaching people how to disagree with one another biblically. “There is a lot of disagreement in the New Testament, and it gives us a template for how to listen to each other to understand rather than to argue,” he said.</p>
<p>Many Christians, though, are disinclined to heed calls for civility. They feel that everything they value is under assault, and that they need to fight to protect it. “I understand that,” Dudley said. “I feel under assault sometimes too. However, I also know that the early Christians transformed the Roman empire not by demanding but by loving, not by angrily shouting about their rights in the public square but by serving even the people who persecuted them, which is why Christianity grew so quickly and took over the empire. I also know that once Christians gained political power under Constantine, that beautiful loving, sacrificing, giving, transforming Church became the angry, persecuting, killing Church. We have forgotten the cross.”</p>
<p>Dudley, my high-school and college classmate, left me with this haunting question: How many people look at churches in America these days and see the face of Jesus?</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW ArticleParagraph_dropcap__uIVzg" data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true">T<span class="smallcaps">oo often, I fear,</span> when Americans look at the Church, they see not the face of Jesus, but the style of Donald Trump.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The former president normalized a form of discourse that made the once-shocking seem routine. Russell Moore laments the “pugilism of the Trump era, in which anything short of cruelty is seen as weakness.” The problem facing the evangelical Church, then, is not just that it has failed to inculcate adherents with its values—it’s that when it has succeeded in doing so, those values have not always been biblical.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">But of course Trump did not appear ex nihilo. Kristin Kobes Du Mez, a history professor at Calvin University and the author of <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781631495731" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="3420899" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1"><i>Jesus and John Wayne: How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured a Nation</i></a>, argues that Trump represents the fulfillment, rather than the betrayal, of many of white evangelicals’ most deeply held values. Her thesis is that American evangelicals have worked for decades to replace the Jesus of the Gospels with an idol of rugged masculinity and Christian nationalism. (She defines Christian nationalism as “the belief that America is God’s chosen nation and must be defended as such,” which she says is a powerful predictor of attitudes toward non-Christians and on issues such as immigration, race, and guns.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Du Mez told me it’s important to recognize that this “rugged warrior Jesus” is not the only Jesus many evangelicals encounter in their faith community. There is also the “Jesus is my friend” popular in many devotionals, for example. These representations might appear to be contradictory, she told me, but in practice they can be mutually reinforcing. Jesus is a friend, protector, savior—but according to one’s own understanding of what needs to be protected and saved, and not necessarily according to core biblical teachings.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“Evangelicals are quick to label their values ‘biblical,’” Du Mez told me. “But how they interpret the scriptures, which parts they decide to emphasize and which parts they decide to ignore, all this is informed by their historical and cultural circumstances.” That’s not simply true of this one community, she added, but of all people of faith. “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/27/special-series/kristin-kobes-du-mez-what-we-believe-about-history.html" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="3421820" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">More than most other Christians</a>, however, conservative evangelicals insist that they are rejecting cultural influences,” she said, “when in fact their faith is profoundly shaped by cultural and political values, by their racial identity and their Christian nationalism.”</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Gender plays a role here as well, according to Du Mez. Over the past half century, evangelicals have tended to depict men and women as opposites. “They believe God ordained men to be protectors and filled them with testosterone for this purpose,” she said. Women, on the other hand, are seen as nurturers. The fruits of the spirit—love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, gentleness, and self-control—are deemed appropriate feminine virtues. “Men, however, are to exhibit boldness, courage, even ruthlessness in order to fulfill their God-appointed role,” Du Mez explained. “In this way, the warrior spirit and a kinder, gentler Christianity <a href="https://religiondispatches.org/are-evangelicals-gentle-ladies-sipping-iced-tea-or-enablers-of-cruelty-and-racism-gender-roles-hint-at-an-answer/" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="3422299" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">go hand in hand</a>.”</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Du Mez pointed out that even men who embrace a kinder, gentler version of masculinity— servant leadership, for example—may tip into a more rugged, ruthless version when they deem the situation sufficiently dire. And for more than half a century, she said, evangelical leaders have found reason to deem the situation sufficiently dire. They rallied their congregations against the threats of communism, secular humanism, feminism, gay rights, radical Islam, Democrats in the White House, demographic decline, and critical race theory, and in defense of religious liberty.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“Evangelical militancy is often depicted as a response to fear,” she told me. “But it’s important to recognize that in many cases evangelical leaders actively stoked fear in the hearts of their followers in order to consolidate their own power and advance their own interests.”</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Du Mez is somewhat more sympathetic toward ordinary evangelicals than she is toward powerful evangelical leaders. She acknowledges that many evangelicals have genuinely sought to follow God’s will; they were directed to believe what they do by pastors, Bible-study leaders, Christian publishers, and Christian radio and television programming. “Many have sought certainty in turbulent times,” she said, and they know that challenging these narratives may well involve the loss of meaningful communities.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Fear has played a central role in the explosion of conflict within American evangelical churches. “Dwelling on fear and outrage is spiritually deforming,” Cherie Harder, president of the Trinity Forum, told me. “Both biblical wisdom and a large body of research holds that fear and grace, or fear and gratitude, are incompatible.” She quoted from one of the New Testament epistles: “Perfect love drives out fear.”</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">There are moments, of course, when fear is an appropriate and necessary response, but there are risks when it becomes a constant presence. “Fear and anger should presumably function as alarm systems—and an alarm is not supposed to stay perpetually on,” Harder said. It is not the onset of fear or anger that is most dangerous, she said, “but stoking it, cultivating it, and dwelling within it that distorts and deforms.”</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">And then there is a regional component to the crisis of evangelical Christianity. Claude Alexander, the senior pastor of the Park Church in Charlotte, North Carolina, told me we must come to terms with the “southernization of the Church.” Some of the distinctive cultural forms present in the American South—masculinity and male dominance, tribal loyalties, obedience and intolerance, and even the ideology of white supremacism—have spread to other parts of the country, he said. These cultural attitudes are hardly shared by every southerner or dominant throughout the South, but they do exist and they need to be named. “Southern culture has had a profound impact upon religion,” Alexander told me, “particularly evangelical religion.”</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The conservative writer David French, who lives in Tennessee, has written about the South’s shame/honor culture and its focus on group reputation and identity. “What we’re watching right now in much of our nation’s Christian politics,” he <a href="https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/where-does-the-south-end-and-christianity" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="3424117" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">wrote</a>, “is an explosion not of godly Christian passion, but rather of ancient southern shame/honor rage.”</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW ArticleParagraph_dropcap__uIVzg" data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true">P<span class="smallcaps">astors now find themselves</span> on the front lines of this conflict, their congregations splitting into warring camps. I spoke with 15 of them, and what I heard was jarring. They told me that nothing else they’ve faced approaches what they’ve experienced in recent years, and that nothing had prepared them for it.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Scott Dudley of Bellevue Presbyterian Church said he knows of several pastors who have not just quit their churches but resigned from ministry, and that many others are actively seeking to switch careers. “They have concluded that their church has become a hostile work environment where at any moment they may be blasted, slandered, and demeaned in disrespectful and angry ways,” he said, “or have organized groups of people within the church demand that they be fired.”</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Several months ago, I spoke with one such pastor, who had not only resigned from his church, a congregation of the Presbyterian Church in America, but had also decided, at least for now, to leave the ministry altogether. He told me that he felt undermined by people in his congregation, including by some whom he had trusted but who, it turned out, were less animated by spiritual matters than by political agendas. This former pastor used the word <i>betrayal</i> in our conversation; he talked about the pain this episode has caused him and his wife. In his words, “The gentleness of Jesus was utterly discarded” by those who felt he wasn’t championing their cultural and political agendas aggressively enough.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“They don’t care about the relational collateral damage,” he said.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In a similar vein, I recently had a conversation with a senior pastor who is planning to leave his position soon; he’s not yet sure where he’ll land, or even whether he’ll stay in the ministry. He has simply been worn down by the divisions within his church. He has not been the target of outward hostility, but he can feel the ground shifting beneath his feet. He feels that he is growing apart from people in the congregation; there’s no longer the same sense of common purpose. He is watching the collapse of an evangelical movement to which he has devoted much of his life. At one point, as we talked about what is unfolding within American Christianity, his eyes welled with tears.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Bob Fryling, a former publisher of InterVarsity Press and the vice president of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, an evangelical campus ministry, has been part of a weekly gathering of more than 150 individuals representing about 40 churches. He’s heard of conflicts “in almost every church” and reports that pastors are exhausted. Earlier this year, the Christian polling firm Barna Group found that 29 percent of pastors said they had given “real, serious consideration to quitting being in full-time ministry within the last year.” David Kinnaman, president of Barna, described the past year as a “crucible” for pastors as churches fragmented.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The key issues in these conflicts are not doctrinal, Fryling told me, but political. They include the passions stirred up by the Trump presidency, the legitimacy of the 2020 election, and the January 6 insurrection; the murder of George Floyd, the Black Lives Matter movement, and critical race theory; and matters related to the pandemic, such as masking, vaccinations, and restrictions on in-person worship. I know of at least one large church in eastern Washington State, where I grew up, that has split over the refusal of some of its members to wear masks.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“There have always been mean people who cloak their unkindness in religious devotion,” one minister in a conservative denomination told me. “The New Testament itself is pretty clear about that.” But, he added, the conflicts have grown more widespread and more intense.  “Without doubt you’ll see—you already are—a ton of pastors quitting,” he said. ”Most pastors actually hate conflict. So if you’re going to pay me one-quarter of what I could make on the market, why put up with this?”</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In his own church, some of the elders are devoted to culture-war politics. “These guys can be a special kind of relentless, and I don’t think I’ve had it as bad as many,” he said. “But when we’re stressed out, trying to be public-health experts without the training to do that, trying to keep our own families from blowing up with COVID stress, getting criticized from both sides at once, and then having folks doing whatever they can to ruin us and get us run out of town— we’d love to just be trusted as friends and shepherds. I understand why many folks have just said, ‘I’m done.’ I’m not there yet, but I hardly think I’m above it or guaranteed not to. I just pray to Jesus to not let me throw in the towel.”</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW ArticleParagraph_dropcap__uIVzg" data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true">T<span class="smallcaps">he historian Mark Noll’s</span> 1994 book, <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780802841803" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="3427066" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1"><i>The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind</i></a>, will be rereleased next year. In the forthcoming preface, which Noll, himself an evangelical, shared with me, he argues that in various spheres—vaccinations, evolutionary science, anthropogenic global warming, and the 2020 elections, to name just a few—“white evangelicals appear as the group most easily captive to conspiratorial nonsense, in greater panic about their political opponents, or as most aggressively anti-intellectual.” He goes on to warn that “the broader evangelical population has increasingly heeded populist leaders who dismiss the results of modern learning from whatever source.” And he laments the “intellectual self-immolation of recent evangelical history.”</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“Much of what is distinctive about American evangelicalism is not essential to Christianity,” Noll has <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-wasting-of-the-evangelical-mind" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="3427217" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">written</a>. And he is surely correct. I would add only that it isn’t simply the case that much of what is distinctive about American evangelicalism is not essential to Christianity; it is that now, in important respects, much of what is distinctive about American evangelicalism has become antithetical to authentic Christianity. What we’re dealing with—not in all cases, of course, but in far too many— is political identity and cultural anxieties, anti-intellectualism and ethnic nationalism, resentments and grievances, all dressed up as Christianity.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Jesus now has to be reclaimed from his Church, from those who pretend to speak most authoritatively in his name.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Too many Christians have “domesticated” Jesus by their resistance to his call to radically rethink our attitude toward power, ourselves, and others, Mark Labberton, the president of Fuller Theological Seminary, told me. We live in “an era of acute anxiety and great fear,” he said. As a result, too often Christians end up wrapping Jesus into our angry and fearful distortions. We want Jesus to validate everything we believe, often as if he never walked the face of this Earth. What we’re witnessing can be explained “more by sociology than Christology,” he said.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Unlike in the Sermon on the Mount and the parable of the Good Samaritan—unlike Jesus’s barrier-breaking encounters with prostitutes and Roman collaborators, with the lowly and despised, with the unclean and those on the wrong side of the “holiness code,” with the wounded souls whom he healed on the Sabbath—many Christians today see the world divided between us and them, the children of light and the children of darkness. <i>Blessed are the politically powerful, for theirs is the kingdom of God. Blessed are the culture warriors, for they will be called children of God.</i></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">For many of us who have made Christianity central to our lives, the pain of this moment is watching those who claim to follow Jesus do so much to distort who he really was. Those who deform his image may be doing so unwittingly—this isn’t an intentionally malicious enterprise they’re engaging in; they believe they’re being faithful—but it is nonetheless destructive and unsettling.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">I believe the portrait I’ve painted in this essay is accurate, but it is also, and necessarily, incomplete. Countless acts of kindness, generosity, and self-giving love are performed every day by people precisely because they are Christians. Their lives have been changed, and in some cases transformed, by their faith. My own life has been immeasurably blessed by people of faith who have walked the journey with me, who have shown me grace and encouraged me in difficult moments. But I can recognize that while also recognizing the wreckage around us.</p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Something has gone amiss; pastors know it as well as anyone and better than most. The Jesus of the Gospels—the Jesus who won their hearts, and who long ago won mine—needs to be reclaimed.</p>

<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Extraordinary claims—such as the charge that the Jewish senator from Vermont is anti-Semitic to the point of spreading ancient slanders against his own people—require extraordinary evidence. Yet large segments of the conservative and even centrist wings of the American pro-Israel movement have whipped themselves into such a frenzy of paranoia that they are making accusations like this without much effort at justification.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Conflating criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism is not new, but it has exploded in the post–October 7 era, in which the rising menace of genuine Jew-hatred on the left and right alike has been accompanied by a growing chorus of hyperbolic, bad-faith accusations. This dynamic might seem paradoxical, but the two phenomena exist in a natural symbiosis. Anti-Semites often insist they are being targeted merely for criticizing Israel; their defense becomes more effective when many people are, in fact, being called anti-Semitic merely for criticizing Israel.</span></p>
<p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" class="ArticleRelatedContentLink_root__VYc9V" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_217="34790766" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_217="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_217="1"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/06/anti-semitic-attacks-only-make-zionism-more-appealing/683055/">Yair Rosenberg: America’s anti-Jewish assassins are making the case for Zionism</a></span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The hallmark of this style of politics is that, although it does not explicitly state that all criticism of Israel is inherently anti-Semitic, it acts as though that were true. Consider another recent episode. Late last month, <i>The New York Times</i> ran a photo of a child in Gaza, who the accompanying article said was “born a healthy child” but had recently been “diagnosed with severe malnutrition.” Later, it added an editor’s note clarifying that he “also had pre-existing health problems,” which should have been noted in the photo caption.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Newspapers make errors from time to time, especially while covering wars, when verifying facts is more dangerous and difficult. Yet some conservatives immediately determined not only that the error reflected an institutional bias against Israel—hardly an indisputable premise, given the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/06/1236130609/new-york-times-hamas-attacks-israel-palestine" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="34791336" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">anger</a> that the <i>Times</i> has generated on the left for its reporting on such topics as sexual violence by Hamas—but that this bias in turn reflected animus against Jews. “The media were so eager to produce a story about Jews behaving amorally that they dropped all skepticism in the face of a sensationalistic claim from a terrorist group with a known history of lying,” <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-mainstream-misinformation-merchants/" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="34791552" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">wrote</a> the <i>National Review</i> editor Philip Klein.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Noah Pollak, a Trump appointee at the Department of Education, did not even grant that the error was inadvertent, <a href="https://x.com/NoahPollak/status/1950315139925774825" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="34792235" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">charging</a> on X that the paper had <i>deliberately</i> published a falsehood: “This is a really strange way of saying ‘We ran a front page blood libel claiming Israel is starving a baby to death, but it’s not true and we actually knew it wasn’t true at the time, but it promoted hatred of Jews so we ran it anyway.’” Likewise, <a href="https://www.commentary.org/seth-mandel/why-the-truth-matters/" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="34792404" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">Seth Mandel</a>, writing in <i>Commentary</i>, treated the error as an act of anti-Semitic malice: “Pointing to a suffering child and saying ‘the Jews did this’ when in fact the Jews did no such thing is an intentional act.” As with the Sanders episode, none of these critics offered any explanation as to why the <i>Times—</i>a newspaper whose executive editor, along with many staffers, is Jewish—would be institutionally committed to whipping up anti-Semitic animus.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The proliferation of the term <i>blood libel</i> as a rhetorical tic is especially revealing. The blood libel is a medieval conspiracy theory that posits that Jews murder Christian children in order to use their blood in religious ceremonies. It was used for centuries to incite murder against Jews. My wife’s grandmother once told me that <i>her</i> mother had a vivid memory of being a child in 19th-century Russia, hiding under a bed and watching a Cossack plant a dead child in her family’s home to blame on the Jews.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">To claim that Israel murders Arab children for religious ends would be a blood libel. And because anti-Semitic ideas mutate over time, some forms of obsessive hatred of Israel assign the Jewish state an almost demonic place in the imagination. Anti-Semitism can express itself as an inability to process Israel’s actions, whether good or bad, in the terms one would use for other nations.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">But to the extent that the outrage over civilian deaths in Gaza is not categorically different from that surrounding, say, the American counterinsurgency in Afghanistan, Israel’s critics are treating it as a normal state. Some elements of the contemporary pro-Israel right have refused to accept that. They have, instead, repurposed the phrase <i>blood libel</i> to cast almost any complaint about the Israeli war effort as anti-Semitic. Because arguments about the scope of war inherently revolve around the propriety of violence, this tactic has limitless application.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">This rhetorical move is striking in its resemblance to the style of the illiberal left. If you identify your own political position with a vulnerable group, you can accuse anybody who disagrees of opposing the group, thus circumventing the need to defend your position on the merits. The most common fallacy associated with this form of backward reasoning is to assume that any argument a bigot might use is bigoted. Because racists oppose affirmative action, its defenders sometimes assume all opponents of affirmative action are racist; likewise, because anti-Semites hate Israel, some of its defenders treat opposition to Israel as presumptively anti-Semitic.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">In some cases, the homage is explicit. Some campus activists have demanded that pro-Israel Jews receive the kind of protective <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/07/columbia-anti-semitism-trump/683586/" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="34794835" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">treatment</a> that university administrators have previously extended to students from, or speaking on behalf of, other marginalized groups. (Others have merely asked that schools fairly apply content-neutral rules to activists who seize common spaces or shout down pro-Israel speakers.) This would be a logical demand if you believe that illiberal discourse norms have benefited minority students and fostered tolerance. But if you believe that they’ve generated resentment without helping their supposed beneficiaries, as members of the pro-Israel right generally do, then it is a strange racket to try to get in on.</span></p>

Its higher-education agenda revolves around the use of pretextual charges of anti-Semitism to withhold funding and subject universities to political interference. It has detained immigrant students for <a href="https://www.washingtonjewishweek.com/judge-tufts-students-op-ed-criticizing-israel-insufficient-to-justify-detention/" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="34795737" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">criticizing</a> Israel and worked with right-wing activists to target protesters and issue draconian demands for “reform.”</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">How could a movement prone to hair-trigger charges of anti-Semitism identify itself so closely with this administration?

(Kingsley Wilson, a Defense Department <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/06/nx-s1-5319995/kingsley-wilson-antisemitic-comments-defense-department-pentagon" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="34796033" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">spokesperson</a>, has dabbled in anti-Semitic memes, including attacking the memory of Leo Frank, perhaps the most famous victim of anti-Semitic violence in U.S. history.)

<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">In fact, the alliance has a certain logic to it. The pro-Israel right is not so much expanding the definition of what constitutes anti-Semitism as shifting it, so that it covers far <i>more</i> criticism of Israel and far <i>less</i> behavior that would traditionally have fit the bill.

<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Here Podhoretz is following in the tradition of his father, Norman, who preceded John as editor of <i>Commentary</i>, once an esteemed journal of Jewish thought. Thirty years ago, after Pat Robertson published a conspiratorial book arguing that a tiny sect of “European bankers” had controlled world affairs for decades, Norman Podhoretz defended Robertson from charges of anti-Semitism in a lengthy <a href="https://www.commentary.org/articles/norman-podhoretz/in-the-matter-of-pat-robertson/" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="34797803" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">essay</a>. “In my view,” he wrote, “Robertson’s support for Israel trumps the anti-Semitic pedigree of his ideas about the secret history of the dream of a new world order.”</span></p>

<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">At the time, Robertson’s crankish views may have seemed marginal enough that his allies could pretend they were tolerable. The door that Podhoretz cracked open for one nutty televangelist has since swung wide open for hordes of obsessive anti-globalists, Nazi-meme appreciators, and other enemies of the Jews. Building a coalition united by its total indifference to Palestinian human rights requires teaming up with some people who may lack a certain moral refinement when it comes to the Jews. But you go to political war with the coalition you have, not the coalition you wish you had.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">This alliance harms the Jews in two obvious ways. First, it provides cover for the legitimization of a strain of far-right anti-Semitism that had been frozen out of mainstream political influence since the demise of the “America First” movement at the start of World War II. Second, it weakens the fight against left-wing anti-Semitism by diluting the charge through overuse. Flooding the public square with counterfeit accusations devalues the currency. And allowing the cause to be turned into cover for a crackdown on the left that is at best loosely related to defending Jews inevitably subjects the idea of opposing anti-Semitism to cynicism. The pro-Israel right’s response to that critique is, of course, to label it as anti-Semitic. “Jews are being threatened with consequences for being seen as exercising undue influence over campus life,” writes the Manhattan Institute legal-policy fellow <a href="https://www.commentary.org/articles/tal-fortgang/trump-not-weaponizing-anti-semitism/" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="34799037" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">Tal Fortgang</a>.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">American culture has passed through an era in which elements of the social-justice left sought to shut down opposition to their agenda by branding disagreement as bigotry. Members of the pro-Israel right, who gained power in part by riding the backlash against the excesses of left-wing illiberalism, have now decided to borrow its techniques. Can they truly not imagine that they will generate a backlash of their own?</span></p>

Pilsen, located in the Lower West Side area, is among the few neighbou</strong>rhoods with buildings that survived the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. <sup id="cite_ref-:2_2-0" class="reference"></sup>In the late 19th century, Pilsen was inhabited by Czech immigrants who named the district after Plzeň (German: <i lang="de">Pilsen</i>), and it also included Slovaks, Slovenes, Croats, Austrians, Poles, and Lithuanians. In 1934, the majority of Czechs, Croats, Poles, and Slovaks resided in Pilsen, making it an ethnically diverse working-class neighbourhood. Since the early 60s, Mexicans and Puerto Ricans moved in and became the majority in 1970 (in 2003, Pilsen was 93% Mexican-American. Pilsen is home to Chicago&#8217;s largest migrant shelter.<br />

<strong>The Berghoff Restaurant.</strong> 1898. What a gorgeous interior, all oak, with old-fashioned lights, banners, and paintings.<br />
<strong>The Rookery Building</strong> is a historic office building, and at twelve stories tall, it is considered the oldest standing high-rise in Chicago. It features exterior load-bearing walls and an interior steel frame, providing a seamless transition between traditional and modern building techniques. Inside is a two-story light court and ornamental stairs. The lobby was remodelled between 1905 and 1907 by Frank Lloyd Wright. It has Moorish, Byzantine, Venetian and Romanesque motifs. <sup id="cite_ref-therookery_7-2" class="reference"></sup>The marble, granite, terracotta, and brick facade is tinted in a reddish-brown hue.</p>

Then she mentioned that the only thing open, an exhibit by Richard Hunt (1935-2023), was &#8220;included&#8221;. What awful art &#8211; abstract metal confabulations with gross, rough welding. I requested a refund, but they denied it. $15, $12 reduced<br />
<strong>Lincoln Park Conservatory.</strong> Thousands of plants in a magnificent 1890 glasshouse, plus gardens and fountains. Donation<br />
</span><strong>Illinois Holocaust Museum.</strong><span style="font-family: arial;"> This features videos with testimonials from Holocaust survivors in a 360-degree theatre: $ 10, no reduction.<br />
</span><strong>North Shore Congregation,</strong> <span style="font-family: arial;">Glencoe. This synagogue was under &#8220;lockdown&#8221; and couldn&#8217;t be entered. From the outside, it appears to be a round brick structure.<br />
<em>Chicago Botanical Garden.</em> After seeing the horrendous prices (parking was $15 for cars, $45 for vans, and $65 for larger vehicles), and entry was $24.95 with no reduction, I turned around after the gate and left.</p>

<section class="ArticleBody_root__2gF81" data-event-module="article body" data-flatplan-body="true">
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">I&#8217;m standing with three scientists in a cold, long corridor that smells of hay, meat, and cat piss. We are looking into an empty, roomy cage. A hole in the cage leads to an outdoor enclosure that contains an Asian golden cat—a beautiful labrador-sized feline with rusty red fur. The scientists want the cat to come through the hole and walk onto the platform that they&#8217;ve set up inside the cage. As it steps, a metal plate will measure the forces exerted by its footfalls.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The cat has other plans. We see its tiger-striped face peer through the hole and then disappear. We wait. Nothing. “It probably knows we&#8217;re here,” says <a href="http://www.rvc.ac.uk/about/our-people/john-hutchinson" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="2566" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">John Hutchinson</a>, one of the expectant researchers. We move to the side so as not to be seen, leaning our heads around the wall of the cage like characters in a cartoon. We are, I realize, trying to out-stealth a cat. It&#8217;s going about as well as you&#8217;d expect.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Golden cats normally live in the jungles of southeast Asia, but this one currently resides in Hertfordshire, England, within the grounds of a charity called the <a href="http://www.catsurvivaltrust.org/" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="40249" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">Cat Survival Trust</a>. The Trust&#8217;s twelve-acre site, manned by volunteers, is home to several species of wild cats, including unwanted animals from various zoos and smuggled individuals seized by customs officials.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">One block of large enclosures houses the bigger species—snow leopard, puma, jaguar, and the extremely rare Amur leopard. Nearby, another block is home to smaller ones like the serval (big ears, expert leaper), leopard cat (spotted coat, huge eyes), caracal (orange coat, tufted ears), jaguarundi (bizarrely weasel-like), and &#8230; er&#8230; a raccoon (definitely not a cat). The enclosures aren&#8217;t labelled and its entrance looks like a farm shop; this isn&#8217;t a tourist attraction. The only visitors allowed are members and school groups—and, occasionally, scientists.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Hutchinson&#8217;s team still isn&#8217;t having any luck with the golden cat. Postdoc Andrew Cuff walks round to the outdoor section to try and flush the animal in, while undergraduate student Luke Grinham mans the equipment. But the cat simply prowls around, watching the hole, twitching its tail nervously, and ignoring the rain that starts to fall.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">“Meow?” says Grinham.</span></p>

<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The earliest known cat—<em>Proailurus</em>, literally “first cat”—lived around 25 million years ago and weighed between 10 and 15 kilograms, about the size of a modern ocelot or golden cat. The family later diversified into around 40 living species (<a href="http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/11/27/sneaky-spotted-cat-has-been-disguised-as-another-species/" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="101717" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">hidden ones are still being discovered</a>). Most are small, and prey upon rodents and other little victims. But several lineages (including the puma, cheetah, and the other &#8216;big cats&#8217;) independently evolved to be big, and can now tackle prey much larger than themselves.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Today, cats span a huge range of sizes. The rusty-spotted cat of India and Sri Lanka weighs just one kilogram, while the mighty Siberian tiger is 300 times heavier. And yet, these animals are surprisingly similar. “It&#8217;s famously said that a lion is just a scaled-up house cat,” says <a href="http://www.goswamilab.com/" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="121434" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">Anjali Goswami</a> from University College London, who works with Hutchinson. “That&#8217;s very weird.”</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Their legs are especially odd. When animals get bigger, their posture changes. Their legs tend to straighten, becoming stiffer and more pillar-like to better support their weight. Not so with cats. When a lion strides across the savannah, it has essentially the same posture as the domesticated tabby that slinks over your lap. Lions, tigers, and leopards—oh my—are, as Hutchinson writes, <a href="http://whatsinjohnsfreezer.com/2014/02/11/freezermas-track3/" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="122765" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">the only large, crouching mammals</a>.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">“You can imagine walking around like this takes a lot of exertion,” says Hutchinson. “We still don’t really understand how they do that without suffering problems.” Odder still, “their muscles don&#8217;t increase enough in size to compensate for how much bigger they are,” says Goswami. “They definitely get weaker as they get bigger, relative to their body size.” Why? No one knows. It could be that a permanently crouched posture is useful for stalking and pouncing. Perhaps it allows them to accelerate forwards more easily, or makes them more agile.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The team is now trying to solve the mystery of the crouching tiger by guiding different cat species over force plates—fancy 3-D bathroom scales that will measure the forces they produce with each step. Meanwhile, a camera will record the positions of their legs. By combining this information, the team can work out how cats differ in their movements, and whether the big ones have any biomechanical tricks that compensate for their unexpected postures.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Hutchinson is an old hand at such studies. He has guided rhinos, emus, elephants, salamanders, horses, and <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/prehistoric-penguin-waddle" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="178401" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">penguins</a> over force plates before. Each species presents its own challenges. Giraffes were especially easy; cats, less so. The tigers of Colchester Zoo were terrified of the force plates and the researchers themselves—were, in turn, terrified of the tigers. But after a lot of chicken bribes (and a few rubber mats that were torn apart by the animals), <a href="http://whatsinjohnsfreezer.com/2013/06/17/slo-mo-cats/" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="178665" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">the team got the data they needed</a>. Here&#8217;s what it looks like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CSjL_f3xPI" data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="178698" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1">when things go well</a>: a tiger strides purposefully through a wooden walkway and over a force plate embedded in the floor:</span></p>

<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Having captured data for panthers, pumas, tigers, and cheetahs, the team are now trying to study smaller cat species, and the Cat Survival Trust has several. “We’re mostly playing it by ear because we don’t know how these animals are going to behave,” Hutchinson tells me. “It’s unpredictable what’s going to happen here so we’re going to start with a relatively easy animal.”</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">He meant the golden cat. Dispirited by its refusal to cooperate, the team tried their luck with Pudding, a rambunctious four-month-old Eurasian lynx with a spotted coat, tufty ears, and large doleful eyes. In the wild, his long legs and large feet would be ideal for padding through snow. In captivity, they&#8217;re great for mauling a dead chicken, and killing a broom that&#8217;s propped up against his cage. Unlike the other golden cats, Pudding is well acclimated to people. “We&#8217;ll get something with him; he should perform again and again,” says Hutchinson.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The problem is that, acclimation aside, Pudding is still a cat—an innate master of not doing what you want him to do. He pounces on the force plates. He walks around them. He steps on to them but then leaps off. He mooches on top of them. He bites the power cables. Hutchinson asks if he can go in the cage and try to lead Pudding around. Sure, says the keeper, “but he&#8217;s got a thing for trying to sever your spinal cord.” The keeper goes in with Pudding&#8217;s teddy—a well-chewed soft toy lynx!—and tries to lead him around, but he leaps and twists and runs, instead of purposefully walking over the plates like the Colchester tiger. “We need a bored cat,” says Hutchinson.</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">As we watch, I ask him if this study will lead to any medical insights that would be important for cat owners. It won&#8217;t. It&#8217;s simply about the evolution of these endearing animals. “It’s a basic science project,” he says. “It’s curiosity-driven.”</span></p>
<p class="ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW" data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Curiosity, huh? Maybe that’s why the cats aren’t cooperating.</span></p>
