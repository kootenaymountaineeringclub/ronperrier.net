My company was Utila Dive Center and for US$300, in addition to the open water course, I had 3 free nights of accommodation, free breakfasts, two free dives after and got a T-shirt. The instructors were all top-notch from Denmark, the US, England and Trinidad\/Tobago.

The Portuguese named it \u201cFlowers\u201d when they colonized it in the 16th century. Then name stuck as did Catholicism.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Labuan Bajo<\/strong> (pop 15,000)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">This town has a particularly unattractive one-way main street separated from the harbour by shacks and a container port. The narrow strip of pavement is flanked by a strip of muddy dirt, an open sewer on one side, piles of dirt, ramshackle guesthouses, restaurants, shops and 32 dive shops.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Fees for visits to Komodo NP: 150,000Rp per visit, Dive permit 225,000Rp per visit, Rinca permit 50,000Rp per visit.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">On our first day, we took a tour that involved two dives and a visit to Rinca (cost 1,150,000Rp or US$93), one of the two main islands that form <strong>Komodo National Park<\/strong>.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">#69 Tempah<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">#70 Wainilu &#8211; a slope of coral debris leading down to dull brown soft corals was a mecca for \u201csmall things\u201d: cuttlefish, a flying gunnard, tiny striped pipefish, lionfish, and the sweetest harlequin sweetlips (a tiny white fish with brown spots and lobed fins fluttering in a small coral patch).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Rinca is the best place to see Komodo dragons as about 20 animals congregate in the small national park headquarters. The rangers carry a forked stick they can use to fend off an attack from the scary-as-hell small dinosaurs. We saw dragons from baby 18-inch ones to monster 2m long ones. It was then a 1-hour walk past a nest and up a hill for panoramic views of the island. There are two and three-hour walks but I see little need for more than what we did. The Rangers are a treasure trove of information.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">#71 Komodo<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">#72 name? many giant mantas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>TOGEAN ISLANDS, SULAWESI INDONESIA<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">With golden beaches, lagoons, lost coves and arguably the best diving in Sulawesi, the Togeans are difficult to get to but supposedly difficult to leave. It is possible to explore all three major reef systems: atoll, barrier and fringing. However, I have heard that dynamite fishing has taken its toll on the fish and the diving is only mediocre. There are no big fish, always a marker of a healthy reef. In my determination to do the entire \u201ctravellers trail\u201d from Makassa to Manado, I will continue doing it the hard way.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Wakai is not a place to stay so arrange accommodation at any of the resorts listed in the travel facts section.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There are no flights to the Togeans. Ferries leave Ampana to Wakai every morning but Friday at 10 am. Buy tickets on the boat. Ongoing ferries from Wakai to Gorontalo leave on Mondays and Thursdays at 4 pm. So I took the ferry on Tuesday, stayed at Blue Marlin Dive Resort on Kadadiri Island and departed on Thursday.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Black Marlin Dive Resort is on Kadadiri Island and they will pick you up at the ferry dock in Wakai. A standard room with a bathroom was 200,000 per night with all meals included. The diving is reasonable at 28\u20ac but everything else is expensive: a large Bingtang is 55,000, an orange juice that normally costs 7,000, is 15,000 and the food is mediocre at best. Water runs from 8-9 and 5-6 and the electricity is on from 5-11pm. The owner has the worst personality in the world and is a real businessman.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">#73 Minicanyon.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The ferry to Gorontalo leaves on Mondays and Thursdays at 4 pm. You can rent an AC cabin, AC business seat or sleep in economy with 2 tiers of mats on the second deck that has open sides that can be covered if it rains (72,000 with a mat called a tatami). Anyone could go into the AC Business and sleep on the floor. I chose the latter and slept alone on the open-top deck with great views of all the stars. Although it was advertised as a 13-hour trip, it took 11 1\/2, and we arrived at 3:30 am. Significantly, we crossed the equator on the way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2015\/12\/12\/raja-ampats-papua-indonesia\/\">RAJA AMPATS, PAPUA INDONESIA<\/a> 5-14\/01\/2015<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Note that live-aboard trips are linked below &#8211; Mergei Archipelago Myanmar, Palau, and the Raja Ampats Indonesia.
