I call them pleasure, purpose, and pride. They also live in countries that encourage those strands. By meeting each of these people and exploring their home countries, we\u2019ll discover the secrets to what makes the people in these places so much happier than those in other places.<\/p>\n<p>Consider Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, who like many Costa Ricans enjoys the pleasure of living daily life to the fullest in a place that mitigates stress and maximizes joy. Scientists call his type of happiness experienced happiness or positive affect. Surveys measure it by asking people how often they smiled, laughed, or felt joy during the past 24 hours. His country is not only Latin America\u2019s happiest; it\u2019s also where people report feeling more day-to-day positive emotions than just about any other place in the world.<\/p>\n<p>Clemmensen represents a brand of happiness typified in the purpose-driven life of Danes. Like all forms of happiness, it assumes basic needs are covered so that people can pursue their passions at work and leisure. Academics refer to this as eudaimonic happiness, a term that comes from the ancient Greek word for \u201chappy.\u201d The concept was made popular by Aristotle, who believed that true happiness came only from a life of meaning\u2014of doing what was worth doing. Gallup measures this by asking respondents whether they \u201clearned or did something interesting yesterday.\u201d In Denmark, a country that has most consistently topped Europe\u2019s happiness rankings for the past 40 years, society has evolved to make it easy to live an interesting life.<\/p>\n<p>And true to Singapore\u2019s reputation for having a semi-fanatical drive for success, Foo\u2014with all his ambition and accomplishments\u2014represents the \u201clife satisfaction\u201d strand of happiness. Social scientists often measure this type of happiness by asking people to rate their lives on a scale of zero to 10. Experts also call this evaluative happiness. Internationally it\u2019s considered the gold standard metric of well-being. Singapore has most dependably ranked number one in Asia for life satisfaction.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video\">\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--content-width InlineElement--desktop InlineVideo\" aria-label=\"Video\">\n<div class=\"SingleVideo\">\n<div data-meta-id=\"inline-4\">\n<div class=\"NatGeoVideoPlayer NatGeoVideoPlayer--videoPlaying aspect-ratio--parent aspect-ratio--16x9 VideoPlayer\">\n<div class=\"VideoPlayer--placeholder absolute-fill\">\n<div class=\"MediaPlaceholder relative MediaPlaceholder--16x9 cursor-pointer height-contain\" tabindex=\"-1\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent MediaPlaceholder__Image\">\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper aspect-ratio--child\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/b55f5ae5-20e6-4600-8143-f3cb055dc9af\/0000015f-165a-d969-a75f-17fa20700000_16x9.jpg?w=1272&amp;h=716\" alt=\"\" aria-hidden=\"true\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<div class=\"LoadAnimation LoadAnimation--darkBG LoadAnimation--md\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<p class=\"Caption__Title\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"RichText\">HOW TO MEASURE HAPPINESS AROUND THE WORLD<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">Happiness is something that everyone feels in a different way.

These factors don\u2019t materialize by chance; they are intimately related to a country\u2019s government and its cultural values. In other words the happiest places incubate happiness for their people.<\/p>\n<p>To illustrate the power of place, John Helliwell, one of the report\u2019s editors, analyzed 500,000 surveys completed by immigrants who\u2019d moved to Canada from 100 countries over the previous 40 years, many from countries considerably less happy. Remarkably Helliwell and his colleagues discovered that, within a few years of arriving, immigrants who came from unhappy places began to report the increased happiness level of their adoptive home. Seemingly their environment alone accounted for their increased happiness.<\/p>\n<p>Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, Clemmensen, and Foo pursue their goals intensely, but not at the expense of joy and laughter, and they look with pride on what they are doing and what they have already accomplished.

But Z\u00fa\u00f1iga didn\u2019t believe his friend, a well-known practical joker. Besides, he wasn\u2019t in the mood. It had been a long day, and he hadn\u2019t sold all of his avocados. \u201cI thought it was an ugly joke,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI was down to my last eight dollars.\u201d He hung up on his friend.<br \/>\nWhen Z\u00fa\u00f1iga showed up for work the next day, the vendors erupted in applause. News of his winning had spread. Each week he bet on the same number; this time his number had come up.<br \/>\nGiddy, Z\u00fa\u00f1iga strode past the produce stalls with an alpha male\u2019s long-armed lope and high-fived his friends and colleagues. They knew that Z\u00fa\u00f1iga had never had it easy. He\u2019d grown up in shantytowns, quit school at 12 to earn a living, struggled with alcohol, and lost the love of his life at age 20 when she left him.<br \/>\nNow that he\u2019d struck it rich, his fellow vendors assumed they\u2019d lose him to a new, more affluent life. But in the weeks after his win, Z\u00fa\u00f1iga surprised his friends by returning to the market, hawking his produce and playing practical jokes. Quietly, though, he was giving away his fortune: a million colones to the friend who\u2019d sold him the lottery ticket, a million to a food-stall owner who\u2019d fed him in lean times, and another million to a market beggar he knew. The rest he gave to his mother and to the four mothers of his seven children.

Although he has no car, no expensive jewelry, no fine clothes or big electronics, he doesn\u2019t need any of those things for happiness or a sense of self-esteem. He lives in a country that, for most of the past century, has believed in supporting every citizen. Unlike most of Central America, where land barons and the military-backed presidents who served their interests dominated after independence, Costa Rica took a different path. With rugged, ravine-etched mountain ranges and a lack of cheap indigenous labor, conditions there discouraged the rise of large haciendas. Instead small-property owners and independent-minded Central Valley farmers thrived after discovering an international market for coffee. Costa Ricans elected teachers as presidents, who, unencumbered by corrosive colonial institutions, introduced policies that launched an upward spiral of well-being and thus the environment for the Latin American character to thrive.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop ImageGroup__Wrapper\" aria-label=\"Image Pair\" data-bumper-index=\"13\">\n<div class=\"ImageGroup__Images\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure id=\"inline-12_0\" class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/efbc775b-f07f-4b59-bdcc-c8f33ba1d7fe\/happiest-places-costa-rica-nicoya-baby-family-mattheu-paley_jpg.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=1684\" alt=\"family members gathering around five-month-old baby-girl, Costa Rica.\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"CenterCropFrame\">\n<div class=\"CenterCropFrame__Frame\">\n<div class=\"CenterCropFrame__Child-Wrap\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure id=\"inline-12_1\" class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/ee5f628e-0dfd-4689-a9d7-de35b3e84032\/happiest-places-costa-rica-sunday-mass.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=1762\" alt=\"a man confesses his sins to a priest at the Basilica in Cartago, Costa Rica.\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption Caption--hideEndBug\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\"><strong>Left<\/strong>: Five-month-old Daynara Altair Jim\u00e9nez Fajardo is the center of her family\u2019s attention.

And yet what works for such societies might not easily translate into solutions for a sprawling, diverse, argumentative, freedom-loving nation like the United States. Could such a tumultuous place, with its racial, ethnic, religious, economic, and political diversity, learn anything useful from Denmark\u2019s wealthy, relatively homogeneous, consensus-seeking social democracy? Likewise, could the United States really emulate the day-to-day joy of Costa Rica? Or the values-driven security of Singapore?<br \/>\nThere\u2019s reason to think so\u2014if a community like Boulder, Colorado, is any indication. If Americans want to feel more joy in their lives, pursue their purpose more rewardingly, and find greater satisfaction in achieving their goals, they could listen to the citizens of Boulder talk about how to shape their community to support, rather than hinder, their collective happiness.

Men in puffy down jackets huddled in conversation, dreadlocked students tapped on computers at outdoor caf\u00e9s, and only a few people in office-friendly plaids seemed to be moving with any destination in mind.<br \/>\nDecades ago, when the City Council decided to allow high-rise buildings downtown that would have interfered with the mountain view, Wright led a successful campaign to ensure no building would cut Boulderites off from nature. It was the beginning of a career of questioning the unquestioned virtue of development. Her public service led her to the state legislature, where she represented much of Boulder for 14 years, with a stint as minority leader.<\/p>\n<div class=\"EmbedInline\">\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--below-paragraph InlineElement--content-width InlineElement--desktop\" aria-label=\"markup\">\n<div class=\"static--markup\">\n<div id=\"ngm-happiest-place-boulder\" class=\"ngm-happiest-place-boulder\">\n<div id=\"g-ngm-happiest-place-boulder_ai2html-box\" class=\"ai2html\">\n<div id=\"g-ngm-happiest-place-boulder_ai2html-desktop-small\" class=\"g-artboard g-artboard-v3 \" data-min-width=\"570\">\n<div id=\"g-ngm-happiest-place-boulder_ai2html-desktop-small-graphic\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"g-ai1-0\" class=\"g-aiImg\" src=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/interactive-assets\/nggraphics\/ngm-happiest-place-boulder\/build-2017-10-17_15-09-34\/ngm-assets\/img\/ngm-happiest-place-boulder_ai2html-desktop-small.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"g-ai1-1\" class=\"g-mobile g-aiAbs\">\n<p class=\"g-aiPstyle0\">HAPPINESS FACTOR BOULDER,\u00a0COLORADO<br \/>\nSocial 43<br \/>\nFinancial 48<br \/>\nPurpose 36<br \/>\nPhysical 44<br \/>\nCommunity 47<br \/>\nPeople in Boulder seem to have learned the secret to living a balanced life.

His analysis included obesity rates, absence of pain, feelings of safety and security, whether people use their strengths and accomplish their goals, and whether they learn something interesting daily. He even included dentist visits, which, counterintuitively perhaps, are strongly associated with happiness. Among 190 U.S. metropolitan areas, Boulder came out on top. (Charleston, West Virginia, had the lowest scores.)<br \/>\nBoulder\u2019s quality of life might not have turned out as well if it weren\u2019t for people like Wright. During the late 1960s developers approached the city for approval to build some high-rises. Wright feared they would destroy the character of her community\u2014a place where downtown high-tech workers can take a nature hike during their lunch hour. In 1971, a few months after the council adopted a plan to allow buildings as high as 14 stories, she championed a ballot measure that limited building heights to five stories. \u201cHad I lost, Boulder would be a forest of high-rises crisscrossed by traffic-jammed streets,\u201d she said. \u201cHere in Boulder we had a jewel to preserve.\u201d<br \/>\nIn the decades since, the community has diligently protected its quality of life. Boulder taxpayers have voted for 300 miles of bike routes that web the city, and yellow lights blink at crosswalks, reminding motorists that pedestrians have the right-of-way. As a result Boulder residents bike to work at one of the highest rates in the nation\u201417 times more than the national average. This makes for cleaner air, fewer accidents, and fewer overweight people.<br \/>\nA progressive food policy has also helped. The city matches the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) dollar for dollar to encourage fruit and vegetable consumption. Last year Boulder became one of the nation\u2019s first cities to approve a soda tax aimed at reducing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. Officials plan to use the revenue from the soda tax to fund health programs for children.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--below-paragraph InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\" data-bumper-index=\"38\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/fdb70f09-302a-4df8-a0ed-cc3e31c70c54\/happiest-places-boulder-colorado-matthieu-paley.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=1708\" alt=\"smiling couple having drink with friends in evening on an organic farm outside Boulder.\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">Lila Sophia and David Tresemer dine alfresco on an organic farm outside Boulder.

The civic-minded hippie generation that spawned companies such as Celestial Seasonings herbal-tea company and WhiteWave health food company are now giving way to Google and tech venture capital firms. A highly paid, more driven culture is replacing the laid-back, outdoorsy one. For all of its list-topping well-being scores, Boulder has curiously high levels of stress. \u201cIt\u2019s not Zen Boulder anymore,\u201d Witters said. On any given day 49 percent of people surveyed in Boulder report feeling stress, higher than the national average. \u201cBut it\u2019s productive stress,\u201d he added.<br \/>\nRuth Wright has felt that stress too, but in a good way, she said. On the last day we met, she arrived brandishing a newspaper with the headline \u201cBoulder extends height limit.\u201d Two nights earlier she\u2019d testified at a six-hour City Council meeting to fend off developers, joining a majority of speakers who urged that a moratorium on buildings higher than 40 feet continue for at least 15 more months. The council voted eight to one for the extension. Wright had prevailed again. When I pointed out that her life didn\u2019t seem to include much day-to-day joy, she corrected me. \u201cFor me fun is getting things done,\u201d she said.<br \/>\nAnd there, in a nutshell, was the Boulder brand of happiness: a community of fit, successful, mission-driven people with a clear vision of the good life, even if they don\u2019t completely live it yet.
