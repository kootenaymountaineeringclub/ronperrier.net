The extensive old city is a tightly twisting maze of narrow lanes. Since hosting Expo 1992 and as the 2004 European City of Culture, the city has had a radical makeover, with its once tatty port hosting Europe\u2019s largest aquarium and a good maritime museum. The old town, too, had a revitalization with new shops, restaurants, and bars.<br \/>\nThe metro is just one line, one of the shortest in Europe.<br \/>\n<strong>History.<\/strong> Founded in the 4<sup>th<\/sup> century BC, it was an important Roman port. The first ring of defensive walls was constructed in the 12<sup>th<\/sup> century, but only one part remains, the Porta Soprana. A victory over Venice in 1298 led to a period of growth, but then internal chaos led to one dynasty, the Grimaldis leaving to establish Monaco.<br \/>\nIn the 16<sup>th<\/sup> century, Genoa benefited from Spanish exploration. Its coffers swelled further in the 17<sup>th<\/sup> century and an outer ring of walls was added. Its newly built palaces were filled with art, attracting masters such as Rubens and celebrated architect Alessi (1512-72) designed many of the city\u2019s splendid buildings. The end of the Age of Exploration came as a blow with its mercantile importance declining.<br \/>\nChristopher Columbus is Genoa\u2019s most famous son.<br \/>\nGenoa was the first northern city to liberate itself from Nazi and Italian fascists in WWII, even before Allied troops arrived. It then developed rapidly with southern Italians manning its docks and factories.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sights.<\/strong> I took the Free Walking Tours that explored much of the old city.<br \/>\n<strong>Palazzi dei Rolli. <\/strong>These are Genoa\u2019s tour de force. 42 of these lodging palaces were built between 1576 and 1664 to host visiting European gentry.

I arrived from Province, France.<br \/>\nIn Ventimiglia, just across the France border, I missed my first access to the expressway. There was a massive flea market happening and I was reminded to never drive the local roads for long. The entire 118 km to Savona would have been one continuous town. With local traffic, pedestrians, stop lights, and bicyclists, trying to drive near the water only leads to endless frustration. Besides you are rarely near the water, but a few blocks inland with only buildings to stare at.<br \/>\nDespite the exorbitant tolls (\u20ac14.60 or about \u20ac1.50 per 10 kilometres), this is the only way to go. These roads are high above the water to miss all the towns and surprisingly the views are good, both up to the mountains and down to the towns and the Mediterranean. Liguria, with its mountainous coastline, has spent a fortune on these highways &#8211; kept almost completely flat as the entire road is either on bridges or through tunnels.<br \/>\nThe main problem may be the crazy Italian drivers who move at autobahn speeds. This road was 4-lane divided and two lanes were not enough for these guys to drive at these speeds. The right lane is full of big trucks going less than 100, so you move into the single left land with care. Italian drivers tailgate, cross the lane lines and are impatient.<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><br \/>\n<strong>Priamar Fortress,\u00a0<\/strong><\/span><strong>Savona.<\/strong> Built on a previous 1213 Castle de Santa Maria, this is a crumbling stone\/brick fortress; its last addition is 1757-59 where the Archaeology Museum is.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GENOA<\/strong><br \/>\n<b>The Lighthouse of Genoa<\/b>\u00a0(Lanterna), is the main\u00a0lighthouse\u00a0for the\u00a0city&#8217;s port.

Today, a large percentage of cultural heritage sites are classified by governmental authorities as exposed to landslide risk. In\u00a0Italy\u00a0in particular, whose terrain is 75% mountainous or hilly, 13\/36 (36%) of heritage sites are affected by slope instability problems, including the Cinque Terre region.<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>The landslide activity of a region can be attributed to many factors. According to GNDCI, most current landslides in the\u00a0Apennines\u00a0are recently dormant, reactivated with climate change. While this explanation links the problem more to environmental and geological factors, mankind also plays a large role in the problem. Relevantly to Cinque Terre, changes in land use and agricultural practices have drastic effects on landslides and their outcomes. In a comparison of images of Cinque Terre land terracing in 1958 and 2000, there appears a clear increase in soil erosion and degradation of vineyard terraces that is consistent with agriculture abandonment in the 1960s as the main focus of the area shifted to tourism and away from the careful &#8220;landscape engineering&#8221; of previous centuries.\u00a0<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>According to city officials, in 1951, about 3,500 acres of Cinque Terre land were cultivated, compared to 275 today.<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>As land was already in a state of degradation in 2011, terrace abandonment is thought to be a contributing factor to the flash flood disaster of 25 October 2011. After 4 hours of uncharacteristic 22 inches of rain and subsequent flash floods, the towns of Monterosso al Mare and Vernazza were virtually destroyed. The other three cities, due to natural topography and effective draining systems, went mostly undamaged.<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>For these reasons, one of the foremost agendas of the National Park is the maintenance and revitalization of the slopes. The value in promoting terracing is two-fold, as it not only addresses landslide control but also recognizes the history and traditions of the villages by bringing back the traditional Cinque Terre vineyards. The &#8220;Uncultivated Lands&#8221; LIFE Project, co-founded in 2001 by the European Community and the Cinque Terre National Park, seeks to recover the unused terraces and to return them to their previous success for the production of Albarola and Vermentino vineyards.<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Parco_Nazionale_delle_Cinque_Terre#cite_note-13\">[13]<\/a><\/sup>\u00a0One such hill, Corniolo, is featured as not only an educational tool for researchers interested in safe and effective cultivating practices but also as a &#8220;laboratory&#8221; to bring back the famed grapes that, in combination, shaped Cinque Terre&#8217;s reputation as wine producers in the Middle Ages.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup> A sub-project, in cooperation with Agricultura Cinque Terre, seeks to do just that, by reintroducing some of the traditional ancient grapes of the region.<br \/>\n<strong>Ecotourism.<\/strong>\u00a0<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>The past three decades have seen significant tourism growth, in turn providing new economic opportunities for places like Cinque Terre.<sup id=\"cite_ref-19\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>\u00a0Ecotourism\u00a0is a branch of the industry with immense benefits, as its aim is the enjoyment and appreciation of a natural landscape in an environmentally conscious manner. For tourists, there is often an expectation of a pristine untouched environment and an interest in the local population as a part of that landscape. In Cinque Terre, the greatest draw for tourists are the hiking trails and scenery among authentic traditional settlements. This socio-cultural element is essential as it highlights the heritage and culture of the picturesque Italian villages.\u00a0<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>Cinque Terre&#8217;s popularity can be attributed to the establishment of the park in 1999 and the addition to the UNESCO World Heritage Site, both of which embrace ecotourism and the need for sustainability.<sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup> As a result of extensive efforts towards infrastructure, improvement of accessibility, and sustainable practices, the park has developed the site and increased its appeal on a global scale. While conservation policy can sometimes subordinate the environment and local interests in favour of promoting tourism, that is not the case in Cinque Terre, where there is such a large personal investment from the local population.<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup> Locals and park representatives work in tandem to understand and adapt to changing tourist needs while mitigating negative environmental consequences.<br \/>\nTo maintain responsible and sustainable tourism within a community, certain criteria must be met. Foremost, tourism must be culturally appropriate. <sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>As a\u00a0World Heritage Site, Cinque Terre embraces its traditions and culture and expands the tourist experience beyond a hike through the hills. The National Park makes a connection to the place with authentic customs, foods, and wines. Second, is the importance of land tenure and connection to the land, which Cinque Terre addresses with lifestyles that depend on both land and water.<sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>\u00a0It is this strong connection to the environment that continues to bring tourists to these towns embedded perfectly in the coastal hills. Finally, what gives Cinque Terre so much potential for sustainable tourism are the local benefits that stretch beyond economics.\u00a0<sup id=\"cite_ref-25\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>As tourism is now so ingrained in the towns, the social benefits of interaction are evident and foster a sense of empowerment and pride that comes with caring for a protected land that millions enjoy.<\/p>\n<p>These are not drive-to villages but are meant to be hiked between &#8211; only 12kms total. All are connected by train, easily the best way to see them if not hiking and the way to return to the start point of your hike. Cars were banned from all the towns 15 years ago.<br \/>\nThey are known for their steeply terraced cliffs supported by low stone walls created 2000 years ago. The towns date from the early Medieval period with the oldest, Monterosso, founded in 648. Most of what is seen today is from the late Medieval period including several castles and parish churches. All are associated with Christian sanctuaries perched high on the cliff sides.<br \/>\nThere are many trails within each town and two main ones connecting them. The two most popular are:<br \/>\n<strong>Sentier Azziero<\/strong>. Dating from the 12th century, this is a 12km old mule trail that before the train came in 1874, was the only way to get between the villages. Connecting all five, it is narrow and precipitous and several sections were severely damaged in floods in 2011.<br \/>\n<strong>Sentier Rosso<\/strong>. 36 km from Porto Venere to Levorno, it is mainly flat and in the trees.<br \/>\n<strong>Monterosso<\/strong> (pop 1530). The only village with a proper beach, it has an old and new half linked by a tunnel.<br \/>\n<strong>Vernazza<\/strong> (pop 865). Its small harbour is the only safe landing on the Cinque Terre coast. It has trademark narrow lanes to stunning views, castle ruins, and a church with a 40m octagonal tower.<br \/>\n<strong>Corniglia<\/strong> (pop 550). On top of a 100m cliff, it is the only one with no direct access to the sea. It has narrow alleys and colourful 4-story houses. It is possible to see all 5 villages in one panorama from here.<br \/>\n<strong>Mantaro<\/strong> (pop 950). Only 860m from Riomaggiore, it is known for its vineyards on its terraces.<br \/>\n<strong>Riomaggiore<\/strong> (pop 1645). In a steep ravine, it is the unofficial headquarters of the Cinque Terre with the park offices.<\/p>\n<p>I missed the turn-off to Monterosso from the autostrada and had the craziest drive-about courtesy of Google Maps and a few bad decisions on my part. If you make a wrong turn, Google Maps instantly reroutes you &#8211; great in cities and one-way highways (the autostrada), but disastrous when she takes you on a 30km drive through the mountains to arrive at the same place you took the wrong turn in the first place!!! It is very difficult to judge scale and direction in such a long distance and impossible to determine elevation change. When I ended up on a one-lane mountain road, I turned around and took a route supposedly 10 minutes longer but not the one I made the error at. I switchbacked up to a high pass and descended steeply to arrive at Livorno, the town just north of Monterosso al Mar. Because of the heavy tourist traffic in the season, all the towns are pedestrianized. Don&#8217;t ask me where they all park. These towns cater to tourists with lots of restaurants and knick-knack stores. They also have an obligatory church.<br \/>\n<strong>Levanto.<\/strong> As isolated as the other 5 towns, it is another cute village on the water boxed in by cliffs on either side, a lovely spot to have lunch on the water. Only 1.8 km away as the crow flies, it was 15 km up over another pass to the first town on the north end of Cinque Terre, Monterosso. The road descending to the town was full of parked cars, On a Saturday, most people were hiking as the village was relatively empty. I walked down to the water; there was not much to see. O<span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">nly a few km from Monterosso al Mar but 23 km by road up and over the mountains, a 35-minute detour off the road to Manarola.<br \/>\nI didn&#8217;t visit Corniglia or Riomaggiore (do you forgive me?) but drove Vernazza and then Mantaro.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"><strong>La Spezia.<\/strong> This working port town has a nice park and walks along the west side, but the east side is an unattractive port and industry. It is the Italian Navy&#8217;s largest naval base. There were many sailboats out in the bay.<br \/>\n<strong>Portovenere<\/strong>\u00a0(pop 4200)<strong>.<\/strong> Again an NM small town, it is at the end of the peninsula west of La Spezia. It is known for its 8-story harbour front houses. It was originally a Roman base.<br \/>\n<strong>Tellaro.<\/strong> Another NM small town is 15 road kilometres south of La Spezia. With no beach, the houses on the shore all tumble down the cliff to above the rocks. Descend through narrow alleys to a stone sidewalk just under the houses that dead-end on each end. The town had few tourists on a Saturday.<br \/>\n==============================++==============================<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--content-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage ArticleBodyTile__Lead\" aria-label=\"Image Lead\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><picture><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/84fe3664-d331-431d-a771-50bb6b763f53\/h_3.00421924.jpg?w=374&amp;h=374\" alt=\"people walk up a winding path on a cliffside\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/picture><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption Caption--hideEndBug\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">Tourists ascend the trail between Manarola and Corniglia, two of the five villages that comprise the Cinque Terre.
