Slocan Lake and Slocan River bound it on the west and Kootenay Lake on the east. The West Arm of Kootenay Lake delimits the group on the south.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The highest point in the group, Cond Peak, rises 2260 meters above Kootenay Lake, but despite the great relative elevation the Kokanee is a gentle place in good weather, with sparse upland forests and many easy summits, especially along the highest ridge, the southwest retaining wall of Kokanee Glacier. Here, the summits of the ridge rise only a few meters above the top of the glacier. Most of the high peaks are within Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In its serene appearance, the uplift which supports Kokanee Glacier is very massive. It intercepts storm winds effectively, and this accounts for the presence of the relatively large glacier, which offers skiing during the summer. The area has more to offer; valley and treeline hiking trails, many lakes, rock climbing on granite and old lead-zinc-silver mining dumps.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Most of the first ascents in the group were by prospectors in the late 1800s, and were never recorded. When the Spokane Mountaineers held their 1937 camp here, they found a record only on Cond Peak, dating to 1925.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Maps<\/strong> &#8211; 82F\/11 Kokanee Peak, 82F\/14 Slocan and 82F\/15 Kaslo, 82F\/10 Crawford Bay; B.
