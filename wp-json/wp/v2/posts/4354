But have also been referred to as the Homelanders (grown up under the threat of terrorism), the Plurals (historic diversity) or the Founders (by MTV).<br \/>\nThey have no concept of life without the Internet, have billions in buying power and are already shaping our culture. Have grown up totally and utterly connected, there are concerns about their Google-fostered expectations that everything be instantaneous, their inability to tolerate even five seconds of boredom and the demands that come with maintaining several identities online from Facebook to Instagram to Snapchat. There is so much pressure on young people, who are still forming their identities, to present a crystallized, idealized identity online.<br \/>\nThere is optimism in their entrepreneurial spirit and finding ways to get offline. Their uberprotective Gen X parents, determined not to raise latchkey kids like themselves, are hovering and helping them digitally detox in screen-less camps and Waldorf schools.<br \/>\nThere are parallels to the Silent Generation, the doted-on, risk adverse, \u201cnice\u201d generation of kids who grew up during the Great Depression and WWII. Both came of age amid geopolitical turmoil and fears about the economy and schools emphasize a profound sensitivity to other kids. They will be known for being well-behaved and perhaps  \u201cblanding\u201d the culture by playing it safe.  <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>GENERATION Z \/ DIGITAL GENERATION Who: Also known as Generation M, Net Generation, Internet Generation \u2022 Grown up with world-wide-web.
