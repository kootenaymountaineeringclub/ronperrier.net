And many pirates like Blackbeard and Captain Kidd rose to notoriety in part due to their Caribbean exploits during that time. But in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, some pirates shifted their geographical focus to the Indian Ocean, along Africa\u2019s eastern coast, lured by treasure-laden ships carrying gold, silver, and gems. Their malevolent deeds created a less famous focus of piracy\u2019s golden era, which continues to some extent today. Who were these pirates and how exactly did this lesser known aspect of piracy transpire?<\/p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/history\/history-magazine\/article\/pirates-golden-age-taverns-booty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Where did pirates spend their booty?<\/i>)<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>The allure of wealth<\/h2>\n<p>By the 1690s, the Indian Ocean teemed with merchant vessels that routinely carried valuable cargoes. Convoys frequently transported wealthy Muslim pilgrims and luxury goods like silks and spices between the Mughal Empire (including present-day India) and Mecca. There were also the treasures carried by the East India Companies of England, France, and the Netherlands; ships headed east transported cash to finance operations in the region, while those returning west contained fine silks, jewels, and spices they had accumulated. The most coveted treasure ships, though, belonged to the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, who ruled his South Asian empire between 1658 until his death in 1707.<\/p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/history\/history-magazine\/article\/pirates-once-swashbuckled-across-ancient-mediterranean\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Pirates once swashbuckled across the ancient Mediterranean.<\/i><\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>Pirates eyed these prospects of enormous wealth\u2014gold, silver, and gems were much more profitable than the Caribbean\u2019s timber, rum, and cloth\u2014and flocked east in droves.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--below-paragraph InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\" data-bumper-index=\"1\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/700bd8d8-f2a7-4019-a53d-0964daeb6f2b\/p062_iStock_GettyImages_PA-533911419.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=1700\" alt=\"Photo of beach with stone graves and palm trees\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">The ruins of a pirate cemetery located on St. Mary\u2019s Island, off the coast of Madagascar.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Arrival at St. Mary\u2019s<\/h2>\n<p>As pirates arrived, they needed a safe harbor to refit their ships and escape storms, as well as a place to enjoy their loot.

The ship, carrying important passengers including the archbishop of Goa and count of Ericeira, Viceroy of Portuguese India\u2014along with diamonds valued at 500,000 British pounds and rare Asian silks and porcelain worth 375,000 British pounds\u2014had been damaged at sea and was docked at the East African island of Reunion for repairs. The men easily seized the vessel and made away with booty worth more than 900,000 British pounds. Tales like this encouraged pirates to troll the Indian Ocean, looking for vessels to plunder.<\/p>\n<p>Another hugely successful pirate was Henry Avery. The Englishman got his start as a member of a merchant ship before becoming first mate on the privateering ship\u00a0<i>Charles II,\u00a0<\/i>employed by the king of Spain. Aboard the\u00a0<i>Charles II,<\/i>\u00a0Avery convinced the other men to commit mutiny and make away with the ship. The mutiny was met with great success, after which Avery indicated he was turning to piracy: \u201cI am bound to Madagascar, with a Design of making my own Fortune,\u201d he stated. He renamed the ship\u00a0<i>Fancy,\u00a0<\/i>customized it to be speedier under sail,<i>\u00a0<\/i>and headed east. Known as the king of the pirates, Avery operated for only a couple of years, though he spearheaded perhaps piracy\u2019s most lucrative raid.<\/p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/history\/history-magazine\/article\/pirate-portrayals-are-more-fantasy-than-fact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Pirate portrayals\u2014from Blackbeard to Captain Kidd\u2014are more fantasy than fact.<\/i><\/a>)<\/p>\n<div class=\"Listicle__Content\" role=\"complementary\" aria-labelledby=\"84710a69-1609-4710-9cd5-c4649370d679-title\">\n<div class=\"Listicle__Content__Title\">\n<h3 id=\"84710a69-1609-4710-9cd5-c4649370d679-title\" class=\"Listicle__Content__Title__Head\">AN ILL-CONCEIVED PIRATE PLOT<\/h3>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/4064615c-c7bb-4c77-9257-ed7032ad0be3\/BAL_2901791.jpg?w=1272&amp;h=508\" alt=\"Image of old map with bay, ships and mountains in distance\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption Caption--hideEndBug\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">A map from ca. 1572 shows a panoramic view of the port at Calicut (today known as Kozikhode).<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"RichText Listicle__Content__Text\">Not all fortune-seeking pirates in the Indian Ocean, however, were victorious. Take Dutch pirate Dirk Chivers, for example. He is infamous for holding four ships hostage in the harbor at Calicut, Kerala, in southern India. He demanded 10,000 British pounds from the Indian governor and East India Company, who countered with 5,000 British pounds. Offended by the offer, Chivers raised the \u201cbloody colors\u201d\u2014a red flag that meant certain death. He set one of the hostage ships on fire, and a compromise was offered, 40,000 rupees. This time, Chivers agreed to take it, but when the money failed to show, he burned a second ship.<br id=\"isPasted\" \/><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">What Chivers failed to realize was that the Indian government and the East India Company were working on another plot. They had messaged pirates in India to attack Chivers and his men, which forced them to flee the harbor. They\u2019d have to find their riches elsewhere.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Piracy\u2019s greatest heist<\/h2>\n<p>In July 1695, word spread that the Grand Mughal of India\u2019s treasure fleet was returning from its annual pilgrimage to Mecca. Henry Avery joined forces with other pirates, including Thomas Tew, a Rhode Islander privateer-turned-pirate. They waited several weeks before their big prizes approached: the\u00a0<i>Fateh Muhammed<\/i>\u00a0and the\u00a0<i>Ganj-i-Sawai.<\/i>\u00a0The pirates first attacked the<i>\u00a0Fateh Muhammed,<\/i>\u00a0the flagship\u2019s escort. There wasn\u2019t much of a fight, and the pirates hauled 50,000 to 60,000 British pounds\u2014but the pirates wanted more. Avery then went after the flagship, the mighty\u00a0<i>Ganj-i-Sawai,\u00a0<\/i>equipped with 62 cannon and hundreds of musketeers. A bloody battle ensued, with the frightened captain finally seeking cover below decks and the remaining Indians surrendering. The haul from the\u00a0<i>Ganj-i-Sawai<\/i>\u00a0was hundreds of thousands of pounds in gold, silver, and jewels, worth tens of millions of dollars today\u2014perhaps piracy\u2019s richest haul ever.<\/p>\n<p>Alas, it didn\u2019t turn out very well for Tew and his crew. Tew died during the battle for the ships, and Avery refused to share more than just a small amount of the plunder with the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/history\/history-magazine\/article\/ahoy-meet-the-real-pirates-caribbean-carolinas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">other pirates<\/a>. Such was the pirate\u2019s life.<\/p>\n<h2>End of an era<\/h2>\n<p>By the end of the 18th century, as Europeans began colonizing throughout the Indian Ocean region, the area became difficult for pirates to operate in, but they never truly disappeared.
