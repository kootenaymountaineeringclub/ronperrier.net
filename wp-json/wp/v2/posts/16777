It is the eleventh largest country in Africa and is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, Morocco and the remnants of Western Sahara in the north, Algeria in the northeast, Mali in the east and southeast, and Senegal in the southwest.<br \/>\nThe country derives its name from the ancient Berber Kingdom of Mauritania, which existed from the 3rd century BC to the 7th century, in the far north of modern-day Morocco. Approximately 90% of Mauritania\u2019s land is within the Sahara and consequently, the population is concentrated in the south, where precipitation is slightly higher. The capital and largest city is Nouakchott, located on the Atlantic coast, which is home to around one-third of the country\u2019s 3.5 million people.<br \/>\nAbout 20% of Mauritanians live on less than US$1.25 per day. Mauritania suffers from several human rights issues, including slavery, where an estimated roughly 4% (155,600 people) of the country\u2019s population are being enslaved against their will, especially enemies of the government.<\/p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Capital:<\/strong>\u00a0Nouakchott<br \/>\n<strong>Area.<\/strong>\u00a01,030,000 sq. km (397,685 sq. mi) 11th largest nation in Africa (by land mass) 90% of its territory is in the Sahara Desert<br \/>\n<strong>Population:\u00a0<\/strong>4.4 million (2018)<br \/>\n<strong>Official Languages:<\/strong>\u00a0Hassaniya dialect of Arabic is the language of the Moor majority, French spoken by many, especially in towns, Southern Black Africans speak Pulaar, Soninke, Wolof.<br \/>\nIt is considered polite to say Salaam Aleikum when entering a taxi, office or when greeting someone.

The next morning at 07:30, I was joined by my travel companion, Arzu Helsman, a 52-year-old from Philadelphia. She moved to the US from Turkey at age 29, is a chef and is married to a chef. She pays no attention to counting countries or Nomad Mania but is a great traveller with virtually identical travel ideas \u2013 drives as much as she can and owned a big truck and camper for many years.<br \/>\nOriginally, I was booked on a trip with Dahid for $1250, joining Ernestine C from Vancouver, Eric from Portland and Pei from London. None of us were able to pay the deposit of $300 (it is impossible to make bank transfers to most African countries form North America). Because of this and the price, I investigated other options just a few days before the slated trip. Mauritania Desert Voyages returned my emails promptly and offered the identical trip for $700 for two and 1300 for one.<br \/>\nDahid was obviously trying to rip us off. I was traveling with EC who unfortunately used their prices to work out a deal with Dahid. He immediately came down to $700, phoned back 10 minutes later returning to the original price and threatened to meet us at the airport with the police. EC eventually negotiated a price of $1000 but without 4 nights accommodation.<br \/>\nI had had enough of crooked Dahid, left that trip and agreed to the deal from Mauritania Desert Voyages. As the original group was now three but still required two vehicles, their price increased to $1500.<br \/>\nArzu had previously contacted MDV so I was very happy to go at such a great price. The final price included airport pickup and my first night\u2019s hotel for $850. We had a choice of staying in Auberges and no cook or desert camping with a cook and no single supplement. We opted for the latter, a much better choice.<br \/>\nAlioune was the owner of MDV and because of the lack of other guides, became our guide and driver. He was the consummate professional, spoke great English, was a very nice guy and was exceptionally experienced in desert travel with his fleet of Toyota Hiluxes. He was joined by Ahmed, a cook. Ahmed was the hardest working guy, was a very sweet person and prepared great food \u2013 three solid, tasty meals per day.<br \/>\nIt was a joy to watch Alli drive through the desert, navigating all the sand with barely a track to follow. Once to climb a dune, he had to make three attempts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>NOUAKCHOTT<\/strong>\u00a0Berber:\u00a0\u201cplace of the winds\u201d (pop 1.2 million)\u00a0is the\u00a0capital\u00a0and largest city of\u00a0Mauritania. It is one of the largest cities in the\u00a0Sahel. It was a village of little importance until 1958 when it was chosen as the capital of the nascent nation of Mauritania. From the 1970s, many Mauritanians began moving to Nouakchott due to\u00a0drought\u00a0and increasing\u00a0desertification. Many settled in poorly maintained, overcrowded\u00a0slums but these have improved.<br \/>\nIt is home to a\u00a0deep water port\u00a0and the\u00a0Airport, Between\u00a0Saint-Louis, Senegal, the city from which the colony of Mauritania was governed, and\u00a0Nouadhibou. Its location also meant that it avoided the sensitive issue of whether the capital was built in an area dominated by the Arab-descended Moors or Black Africans.<br \/>\nLocated on the\u00a0Atlantic\u00a0coast of the Sahara Desert,\u00a0the coastal strip of shifting\u00a0sandbanks\u00a0and sandy beaches is mostly left empty and allowed to flood. Nouakchott is largely flat and only a few meters above sea level. It is threatened by the sand dunes advancing from its eastern side which pose a daily problem.\u00a0Most buildings are one-story.<br \/>\n<strong>Economy.<\/strong> 90% of the city\u2019s economic activity consists of informal transactions. Some inhabitants have multiple addresses and maintain strong ties with their regions of origin, at times returning for labour.<br \/>\nNouakchott has a Chinese-built\u00a0deepwater port\u00a0that opened in 1986. Nouakchott\u2013Oumtounsy International Airport (NKC), opened in 2016.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Cairo\u2013Dakar Highway leg\u00a0from Nouakchott to Nouadhibou was paved in 2004, although the Nouakchott-Rosso\u00a0leg was paved before independence.\u00a0A 1,100-kilometre (680\u00a0mi) road (Road of Hope)) connects to N\u00e9ma\u00a0via\u00a0Boutilimit\u00a0and\u00a0Kiffa.<br \/>\nOne beach is devoted to fishing boats where fish can be bought fresh at the\u00a0Fish market. Nouakchott is a principal selling place of native\u00a0Saharan meteorites.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 1 <\/strong>Sun Oct 16.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Drive Noukachott to the Dunes of Amatlich. 350 km.<br \/>\nWith four of us in the Hilux and the back crammed with camping equipment, it was not long before we left the paved highway that goes directly to Chinguetti, and followed a narrow dirt track marked by painted stones. The initial dunes were replaced by the Sahel with grass and acacia trees. We encountered a large lake full of trees formed by an unusually wet summer. Many villages were passed through \u2013 round stone bases with thatch roofs, adobe buildings and often a new house that looked incongruously out of place. At this time of the year, there are few residents, but in the summer the old residents return from the cities and reconnect with their past.<br \/>\nThe entire day was spent off-road following minimal dirt roads and through dune fields. The track went through White Canyon and low grey, rocky mountains. We stopped under a large overhang for lunch.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Dunes of Amatlich<\/strong>, Located southwest of the city of Atar, Erg Amatlich is a vast dune barrier 130 km x 5 km to 8 km trapped between the mountains of the Adrar plateau. The erg, stretching from NW to SE, originates at the cliffs of the Tifoujar Pass and extends to the Akjoujt area and the Atlantic Ocean. In addition, there are canyons, cliffs, cultivable basins and palm groves like Azoue\u00efga, located on the west side of the erg. There are many Neolithic sites, such as the Khatt Lemaiteg.<br \/>\n<em>We arrived at the dunes at about 4 and were joined by Dahid\u2019s group and another truck with two that we never met. Before dinner, most of us made the laborious climb up the steep dune \u2013 2 steps up and one down. The sunset from the top of the big dunes was lovely as the pink dunes turn red ochre at dusk depending on the light.<br \/>\nOvernight desert camp. I elected to not use the mosquito tent and was only harassed by a few flies. It was extremely hot all night, finally cooling down minimally at 6.<br \/>\n<\/em><strong><br \/>\nDay 2 <\/strong>Mon Oct 17. Drive 240km\/ 3hrs to the Oasis of Elmedah and Legleitat, Tivoujar Passe, Wait Valley, and arrive in Chinguetti.<br \/>\n<strong>Paysage culturel d\u2019Azougui<\/strong>\u00a0Tentative WHS(14\/06\/2001).\u00a0The cultural landscape of Azougui consists of:\u00a0the oasis and the palm grove, the oldest in the region, now with more than twenty thousand palm trees and the traditional system of canalization. Virtually empty at this time of the year, we drove through the \u201cdowntown\u201d of low adobe homes to an overlook.<\/p>\n<p>The archaeological site of Azougui: The first capital of the Almoravids, it is a fortress built in dry stone with a surrounding wall enlarged over time to a perimeter of several kilometres. It had a role in the trans-Saharan trade of ceramics and glass, imported from the Maghreb, the Iberian Peninsula, and the Near East. Imam El Mejdhoub, a major mythical and religious personality, and his follower Imam El Hadramy El Morady have tombs located in the heart of the site.<br \/>\nAt the village, we met an unusual Scottish woman who had lived in Africa for 30 years and now had been in Azougui for 2+ years due to lack of funds. The village was relatively deserted but comes to life in the summer when many old residents returne to harvest the dates. They make enough money then to support themselves for the rest of the year.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Terjit Oasis.<\/strong>\u00a0An\u00a0oasis\u00a0(in the proper sense: a desert spring or other water source), 45km by road south of\u00a0Atar\u00a0and popular with\u00a0Mauritania\u2019s few tourists. It nestles in a gorge of red cliffs on the western edge of the\u00a0Adrar plateau\u00a0with the palm grove stretching a few hundred metres alongside a stream that emerges from two springs that tumble out of the rocks. One is hot, the other cold, and they mix in a large, square, concrete basin. Two Austrians had arrived on public transport \u2013 I was disappointed when they were bathing in the basin.<br \/>\nWe opted for a better swimming hole several kilometres away. Tourists can pay to stay in tents in the palm grove. In the summer, it is very busy but we saw only a few tourists. <em>We drove offroad to a wonderful swimming hole formed by a depression in the riverbed and surrounded by lovely rocks. This is the last time we saw Dahid and my three friends. Ali had crossed the river so that we had a shorter carry for our lunch gear near the pool.<\/em> <em>On the way back, Ali paused for a shift over the center of the river and we were immediately mired in the quicksand. After three hours of digging, placing rocks for jacks and then placing rocks under the rear wheels and using branches, we amazingly extricated ourselves from the mess. I thought we would be camping here. \u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>It was a 2-hour drive on a rough track to Chinguetti, mostly over a high flat rocky plateau.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>THE ADRAR. The Unesco-listed Adrar is the undoubted jewel in Mauritania\u2019s crown. It\u2019s an epic Saharan country and shows the great desert in all its variety: the ancient Saharan towns of Chinguetti and Ouad\u00e2ne, mighty sand dunes that look sculpted by an artist, vast rocky plateaus, and mellow oases fringed with date palms. For desert lovers, the Adrar is a must.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nChinguetti <\/strong>(pop 4000). One of the more attractive of ancient caravan towns in the Sahara, Chinguetti is Unesco World Heritage listed. It was once famous for its Islamic scholars, and was the ancient capital of the Moors; some of the buildings date from the 13th century. Chinguetti butts up against Erg Warane, Mauritania\u2019s biggest stretch of dunes, and is more than enough to meet traveller\u2019s expectations of the great Saharan sand ocean.<br \/>\nKsar\u00a0or\u00a0qsar\u00a0is the North African term for \u201cfortified village\u201d. Chinguettti was founded in the\u00a013th century\u00a0as the center of several\u00a0trans-Saharan trade routes\u00a0the city is seriously\u00a0threatened\u00a0by the\u00a0encroaching desert. The western boundary is marked by tall sand dunes and several houses have been\u00a0swallowed by the desert.<br \/>\nThe town is divided in\u00a0two parts\u00a0by a\u00a0wadi. On one side lies the\u00a0old town, and on the other the\u00a0new town. This is the third reincarnation of the old town \u2013 the previous two were abandoned as they were buried under the sand.<br \/>\nBefore dinner, we walked into the old town, the highlight of any visit is a wander through the labyrinthine lanes of Le Ksar (Old Town). The main building that dominates the old town is The Friday Mosque of Chinguetti, an ancient structure of dry-stone construction, featuring a square minaret capped with five ostrich egg finials. The mosque was built in the thirteenth or fourteenth century, and it is believed to be the second oldest continuously used minaret in the Muslim world. We could not enter the mosque but looked through the door \u2013 many large white columns and a dirt floor.<br \/>\nOther notable buildings in the town include the former French Foreign Legion fortress; and a tall water tower. But among these, the most important is the famous libraries, giving the town the name \u201cThe City of Libraries\u201d. The Old Quarter has five important manuscript libraries of scientific and Quranic texts, with many dating from the later Middle Ages.<br \/>\nWe entered possibly the largest of the libraries and were shown several ancient books carefully stored in small boxes on the shelves.<br \/>\nThe dunes are best seen by camels, but I have ridden camels before and wanted to avoid that experience.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"attachment-featured-slider  wp-post-image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.alluringworld.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/5-Chinguetti-700x440.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"622\" height=\"391\" \/><strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"fl-photo-img wp-image-3609 lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/wildmanlife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Mauritania-Chinguetti-libraries-drone-shot-4.jpg?resize=1440%2C960\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/wildmanlife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Mauritania-Chinguetti-libraries-drone-shot-4.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/wildmanlife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Mauritania-Chinguetti-libraries-drone-shot-4.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/wildmanlife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Mauritania-Chinguetti-libraries-drone-shot-4.jpg?resize=1440%2C960&amp;ssl=1 1440w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/wildmanlife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Mauritania-Chinguetti-libraries-drone-shot-4.jpg?resize=800%2C533&amp;ssl=1 800w\" alt=\"Chinguetti Mauritania Sahara Desert Mosque Old Town Drone shot\" width=\"1050\" height=\"1050\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/wildmanlife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Mauritania-Chinguetti-libraries-drone-shot-4.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/wildmanlife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Mauritania-Chinguetti-libraries-drone-shot-4.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/wildmanlife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Mauritania-Chinguetti-libraries-drone-shot-4.jpg?resize=1440%2C960&amp;ssl=1 1440w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/wildmanlife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Mauritania-Chinguetti-libraries-drone-shot-4.jpg?resize=800%2C533&amp;ssl=1 800w\" data-src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/wildmanlife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Mauritania-Chinguetti-libraries-drone-shot-4.jpg?resize=1440%2C960\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 <\/strong>Tue Oct 18<strong>.<\/strong>\u00a0<em>In the morning, we drove 180 km to Oudane, passing through Tenouchert Oasis.

Accessed only by desert tracks, it can only be entered through one gap in the rings. It is 40 kilometres (25\u00a0mi) in diameter, exposing sedimentary rock in layers that appear as concentric rings.\u00a0Igneous rock\u00a0is exposed inside as spectacular\u00a0rhyolites\u00a0and\u00a0gabbros that form two concentric\u00a0ring dikes and a central\u00a0megabreccia. A kimberlitic plug in the northern part is dated to around 99\u00a0million years old.<br \/>\nIt is not an impact structure. The circular distribution of ridges and valleys is explained as the formation of cuestas by the differential erosion of alternating hard and soft rock layers uplifted as a dome by an underlying alkaline igneous complex of the Cretaceous age.<br \/>\nThe structure is also the location of exceptional accumulations of Acheulean archaeological artifacts\u00a0along\u00a0wadis\u00a0in the outermost annular depression: stone tools, Neolithic\u00a0spear points but no manmade structures.<br \/>\n<em>We drove on sand tracks on a route that passed through gaps in the ridges to the centre elevated area where someone had built an auberge 20 years ago but hasn\u2019t functioned for at least 15.

Alongside Chinguetti, Tichitt, and Oualata, Ouadane became an important trading and religious center along one of the most important trans-Saharan routes. The walls surrounding old Ouadane suggest it was a\u00a0<em>ksar<\/em>, or fortified village.<br \/>\nAs you arrive across the sands or plateau from At\u00e2r or Chinguetti, the stone houses of Le Ksar al Kiali (Old Quarter) seem to tumble down the cliff. Buildings in the ksar that have not already crumbled to the ground are in a precarious state of disrepair, with one notable exception: the old mosque on the western end, at the base of the town. Built in the 15th\u00a0century, the mosque received some restoration attention without detracting from its ancient charm.\u00a0Like all mosques, the old mosque in Ouadane has a minaret, but unlike most mosques, this minaret is neither tall nor narrow. With a square base of 4 or 5 meters on each side, and no higher than a two-story house, this minaret is reminiscent of a turret built for military purposes. Yet, the shape and size of this structure may be the reason why it lasted so long.<br \/>\nThe top of the hill is dominated by the minaret of the new mosque, which is a mere 200 years old. In between the two mosques, the crumbling structures seem to have been piled up higgledy-piggledy by some giant child playing with building blocks. Like Chinguetti, Ouad\u00e2ne was a place of scholarship and is home to over 3000 manuscripts held in private libraries.

Painted in red ochre on a series of large boulders on the edge of a great valley, they are located in overhangs formed in the boulders, small and quite faint \u2013 one of an elephant, two giraffes and a man are the best preserved. Walk through narrow \u2018joints\u201d and around the base to see them all.<br \/>\nThe main attraction is the landscape &#8211; an enormous valley that disappears on the far side into a canyon at the base of cliffs and a large plateau.<br \/>\nA movie about Algeria had been shot in the valley in 1984. A white tend in some rocks in the middle of the valley was a remnant of the movie.<\/p>\n<p>We drove over\u00a0<strong>Amogjar Passe<\/strong> on our way to Atar. It is a\u00a0mountain pass of\u00a0pink-brown\u00a0sandstone worn away by repeated cycles of extreme dryness and torrential rain.\u00a0Descend steeply from the high rock plateau down a road cut into the sides of the cliffs. The bases of the steep valley walls are covered in\u00a0scree, loosed by the erosion of the rainfall.\u00a0There is little plant life in the pass.\u00a0Acacias\u00a0are a notable exception, as they are resistant to\u00a0drought.<br \/>\nThe Neolithic rock paintings of Agrour Amogjar are near the pass, northeast of Atar at 20\u00b035\u2032N 12\u00b045\u2032W. Today\u2019s drive was 400 km.<br \/>\n<strong>At<\/strong><strong>\u0101<\/strong><strong>r<\/strong> (pop 25,000). With the grandiose Adrar on its doorstep, this secluded town in the middle of the desert is an excellent place in which to organize camel or 4WD forays into the dune fields.<br \/>\nAli needed to replace the fuel filter (every 4-6,000 km) and change oil. We were given a dealer car and went to lunch at an obscure restaurant that Ali claims is the best authentic food in Atar. The truck also needed brake work and repair of a leak in the 4WD so we ended up in Atar for over 3 hours. Arzu and I parked outside the main grocery store on chairs, read and drank to pass the time.<br \/>\nThe main gare routi\u00e8re, in the heart of town, is where you can get vehicles for Nouakchott (six hours) and Cho\u00fbm (three hours). Cho\u00fbm transport is timed to meet the train heading to\/from Nou\u00e2dhibou<br \/>\nAli took a shortcut through the village and desert where he was born to save 40 km of the drive to Choum on good pavement. At Choum the road turns west to follow a deep, sandy track that parallels the iron ore railway line for 60 km out to Ben Amera before crossing it at Km 395.<br \/>\n<strong>Ben Amera<\/strong> is near the border with Western Sahara. Pass through an army checkpoint on the railway, cross the tracks and drive 4km north of the train track. It is Africa\u2019s largest monolith and the world\u2019s second-largest monolith behind Uluru, in Australia, rising 633m (2027ft) above the desert floor.<br \/>\nA lesser monolith,\u00a0<strong>A\u00efsha<\/strong> lies a 20-minute drive to the west of Ben Amera and is where we camped. \u201cIn 1999, a dozen international artists celebrated the millennium by carving into the boulders at the base of A\u00efsha. The deep etchings of animals and abstracts may use multiple stones.<br \/>\nON Aisha. We desert camped on the north side of Aisha. It was a magical spot on wind-packed sand, windy, eerily quiet and with a marvellous dark sky.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 <\/strong>Thur Oct 20.<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><em>After breakfast, we walked around the east base of the giant monolith to the south side with all the rock art skillfully carved into the granite boulders. Many were very nicely done \u2013 birds, faces, flying birds, a mask, and many more. We wandered further along to a cave where we waited for Ahmed who had cleaned up camp and picked us up.<br \/>\nWe returned past Ben Amera, crossed the railway and drove on a very fast desert track at 90 km\/hour back to Choum. We got some drinks and gas and continued 200 km to Zouerat, the location of the iron mine and the starting point of the iron ore train.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Choum<\/strong>\u00a0(pop 2,735 2000) is close to the\u00a0border\u00a0with\u00a0Western Sahara.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The town grew from its position on\u00a0trans-Saharan trading routes.

In the early 1960s, the French in Mauritania wished to build the line from Nouadhibou to Zou\u00e9rat to exploit the iron ore reserves at Zou\u00e9rat. The Spanish authorities then responsible for Western Sahara negotiated to allow the railway to be built through Spanish territory over the relatively level desert but imposed conditions unacceptable to the French. The French engineers, therefore, built the line parallel with the border and tunnelled through the Choum hill spur \u2014 two kilometres through solid granite just to stay within French territory. The tunnel has been called a \u201cmonument to European stupidity in Africa\u201d. The absurdity was highlighted when the southern part of the territory of Western Sahara was briefly administered by Mauritania after the Spanish withdrew in 1975\/1976. The tunnel is no longer in use and a 5 km section of the railway now cuts right through the POLISARIO-controlled part of Western Sahara (21.354867\u00b0N 13.012644\u00b0W).<br \/>\nThe N1 highway from\u00a0Atar\u00a0now runs on good pavement all the way north to\u00a0Zou\u00e9rat, but the sandy track paralleling the railway west to\u00a0Nouadhibou\u00a0traverses low dune cordons so is much easier in a 4WD.<br \/>\n<strong>Iron Ore Train.<\/strong> Before sunset, most travellers go to Choum station and wait for the iron ore train. There is no set schedule but every day the train stops at Choum station at approximately 9 pm. Those who want to ride the train overnight board the train. Goggles and a protective garment are usually provided. It is about a 12-hr ride, mostly through the night and thus cold with no views of the landscape except for the starry sky. The iron ore train has achieved \u201ccult\u201d status and is generally described as one of the most unpleasant experiences \u2013 constant dust from the iron ore while sitting for 12 hours on rock. Despite this, one only hears how tremendous an experience it is. I can only believe that the actual train ride, with the clickety-clack of the train on the rails, is a new experience for most. In my university days, one summer, I worked as a brakeman on the Canadian Pacific Railway \u2013 with Medicine Hat as the base, we worked the \u201cfast track\u201d on freight trains 300 km NW to Calgary and east to Swift Current. I loved the job but did not need to experience this train.<br \/>\nArzu elected to get on the train in Zouerat for a more reasonable 5-6 hour trip. Boarding at 4 pm, the start is in daylight and avoids the long, cold night. Ali rode with her for company, and Ahmed and I returned to Choum, drove out into the desert and set up camp. I had a great 3-hour sleep. He returned to Choum at 9 and picked them up, both filthy from the constant blowing iron ore dust. Arzu \u201cloved every second of it\u201d.<br \/>\n<em>I have learned to distrust other traveller\u2019s accounts of their experiences as most forget how boring or unpleasant or the actual reality of them. They seem like \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d to me.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 <\/strong>Fri Oct 21. It was a long drive from the desert camp near Choum to Nouakchott (550 km) via Atar. Pass through eroded boulder fields and climb up two escarpments. Ali took the shortcut saving 40 km by again driving through the village of Azouge where he was born (it must have been depressing for him to see the ruin of the house he had purchased for his mother). It was 1 \u00bd hours total to Atar. We stopped to stock up on food and drinks at the Smash Market which carried many products desired by tourists.<br \/>\nThe road passed through a flat Sahel bordered by sand dunes. We stopped at the same overhang we had used for lunch on our first day.<br \/>\nWe arrived in Nouakchott in the afternoon.<br \/>\nAny train riders in the groups arrive in Nouadhibou at about 9 am and then have the long drive south to Noaukachott for their last day in Mauritania. It sounds exhausting.<br \/>\nI had had virtually no wifi for the entire 7 days and had a lot of business to conduct so had encouraged this long day of driving. A shower was welcome. I would also have all day to see the sites of Nouakchott the next day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 <\/strong>Sat Oct 22.<br \/>\n<strong>NOUAKCHOTT<br \/>\n<\/strong><em>I spent the morning finishing business and updating Nomad Mania and this website at the hotel. Ali arrived at noon and we finished our financial transactions.<br \/>\nWhat a great hotel. It had great wifi. They had no checkout time and I hung around in my room, napped and had a shower at 4 pm. Ali arrived at 5 with Arzu and we had dinner at the hotel. We went for a short tour of some of the sights of Nouakchott and then went out to the airport for our late flight.<br \/>\n<\/em><strong><br \/>\nPort de P\u00eache<\/strong>. Urban Legends. The Port de P\u00eache is Nouakchott\u2019s star attraction. Both lively and colourful, you\u2019ll see hundreds of teams of mostly Wolof and Fula men dragging in heavy fishing nets. Small boys hurry back and forth with trays of fish, which they sort, gut, fillet, and layout on large trestles to dry (that must be the old way, we didn\u2019t see any of this). The best time is in the late afternoon when the fishing boats return.<br \/>\nWe went down at 5 pm. There were no nets but hundreds of boats already in and more coming. They ride the surf, usually broach and stabilize the front with an anchor. Then young men wearing green rubber jackets with doughnuts on their heads wade into the surf. Fish are shovelled out of the open boats into large plastic crates and carried into the market on their heads. It must be hot, back-breaking work. Getting the boats up the beach is torturous to watch. Each incoming wave moves the boat a foot or two. Eventually, they get the boats onto rollers (old metal cylinders). The boats are painted in wildly colourful designs and the long rows make for great photos.<br \/>\n<strong>Grande Mosqu\u00e9e<\/strong>, slender minarets, Looking into the doors, see endless white columns painted in stark black bas-relief patterns. Non-muslims are not allowed to enter. Probably the same French soldiers walked into the mosques with their dirty boots.<br \/>\nThe nearby market was very rough with sandy dirt paths amid tables all selling the same stuff. After searching for an hour, I finally found some playing cards. One of the card games we are playing requires two decks.<br \/>\n<strong>Mosqu\u00e9e Marocaine<\/strong>\u00a0towers over a bustling market area.<br \/>\n<strong>Mus\u00e9e National.<\/strong>\u00a0Moderately worthwhile for anyone with an interest in Moorish culture. Prehistoric gallery with archaeological, ethnographic displays from Moorish society.<br \/>\n<strong>Nouakchott beach.<\/strong>\u00a0There are two decent beaches around 5km north of the centre, Plage Pichot and Plage Sultan. Popular with the small expat community on weekends. Beware of undertows.<br \/>\n<strong>Saudi Mosque<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Marche Capitale<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Maurtainia Desert Voyages was a welcome breath of fresh air after 3 countries (Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali) where the guides were basically crooks intent on getting as much money from us as possible. Ali was the consummate professional.<br \/>\nArzu was the best travel companion I have had so far in West Africa. She was not obsessed with photography which can get very tiring. She had no problem roughing it by staying in desert camps, sleeping on the ground and not having a shower every night. On her own without consulting me, she added Nouadhibou to see the ship graveyard which had been cleaned up and necessitated a big detour. Then the iron ore train was added, thankfully only for the 6-hour ride from Zouerat to Choum. That meant that we had to drive 200 km to Zouerat, wait in the heat for 4 hours for the train to arrive, return the same 200 km back to Choum and then wait in Choum until the slow train arrived. Thankfully, she assumed the $200 cost of this detour.<br \/>\n<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Departure: With Arzu and EC who were continuing to Algeria, Oct 22 @ 23:15-03:50+1 \u2013 NKC-ALG @ Air Algerie AH4015 (non-stop 3.5hrs)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Observations about Mauritania<br \/>\n1. Greetings.<\/strong> Whenever anyone is met, stranger or not, Mauritanians start the long ritualized banter asking about everything &#8211; their families, friends and how they are doing \u2013 it is the equivalent of \u201chi, how are you\u201d. Both talk at the same time ignoring the other going on an on.<br \/>\n<strong>2. Landscape.<\/strong> I thought the country was one big flat desert, but in fact has a varied terrain of high escarpments eroded into short cliffs and jumbles of rock. After an unusually wet summer, seasonal lakes were common. There are few good highways and most of our travel was over minimal sand or dirt tracks that required a lot of local knowledge to route find. The best experiences are seen on these \u201cdetours\u201d.<br \/>\n<strong>3. People.<\/strong> Mauritania is reputed to be one of the last remaining countries where slavery of the black population by the Arabs is still actively practiced. Ali\u2019s opinion was that these black people were treated as part of one big, contented family and had little desire to leave the certainty of these relationships. Poorly educated or trained, they perf0rmed most of the manual labour. There is thus a huge economic disparity between these two populations.<br \/>\nBlack kids are often barefoot, poorly dressed, filthy (like most third world countries, immaculately clean clothes are the norm), and doing much of the manual labour.<br \/>\nThe majority of the population has migrated from their villages into the big cities. Villages are empty and the adobe buildings \u201cmelting\u201d into the ground. Some past residents have built new houses that look conspicuously out of place. Many return in the summer to harvest dates or tend crops. They are escaping the heat and high humidity of the coast to drier and cooler higher elevations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>WHS<br \/>\nParc National du Banc d\u2019Arguin.<\/strong> This World Heritage-listed park occupies most of the Atlantic coast in northern Mauritania. It is an important stopover and breeding ground for multitudes of birds migrating between Europe and southern Africa, and as a result, is one of the best birdwatching sites on the entire continent. It extends 200km north of Cape Timiris (155km north of Nouakchott) and 235km south of Nou\u00e2dhibou. The ideal way to approach the birds is by a traditional fishing boat, best organised from the fishing village of Iwik.<br \/>\nInside the park, there are official campsites that are equipped with traditional tents. Meals can also be ordered. There\u2019s no public transport, so you\u2019ll need to hire a 4WD with a knowledgeable driver, either in Nouakchott or in Nou\u00e2dhibou, allowing a couple of days for the trip. Permits are issued either at the entrance gates or in Nou\u00e2dhibou at the park office.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tentative WHS\u00a0<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Site arch\u00e9ologique de Kumbi Saleh<\/strong> (14\/06\/2001).\u00a0The site of Kumbi Saleh, the capital of the Empire of Ghana was discovered in 1914. The mosque is considered the oldest and largest mosque in West Africa, remarkably restored.\u00a0Archaeological objects include epigraphic plaques, an astonishing coat of mail, and rare metal objects.\u00a0The oldest date of the site dates back to the 4th century. The change in the axis of trans-Saharan trade to Tichitt, Oualata, and Timbuctou accelerated the abandonment of the city.<br \/>\n<strong>Site arch\u00e9ologique de Tegdaoust<\/strong> (14\/06\/2001). Tegdaoust was an essential stopover in the trade of gold, iron, and copper, the first stage on the road linking the Maghreb and Sudan. This city was very wealthy with a flourishing gold trade between the 8th &#8211; 13th centuries. Between 1050 and 1070, the Empire of Ghana was conquered by the Almoravids.
