The once-great metropolis was situated on several trade routes, grew to become a walled city of more than 100,000 residents by the 11th century, and was a contemporary of the Middle East&#8217;s most powerful cities of Constantinople, Baghdad, and Cairo. At its height, the city became known as the City of Forty Gates and the City of a Thousand Churches. Ani\u2019s Armenian rulers and city merchants funded an extraordinary number of places of worship, all designed by the greatest architectural and artistic minds in their milieu. Although the nickname was hyperbole, archaeologists have discovered evidence of at least 40 churches, chapels and mausoleums to date.<br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/e\/e3\/Ani_seen_from_Armenia.jpg\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"602\" height=\"401\" \/><br \/>\nIt is literally in the middle of nowhere on a secluded plateau. Apart from the beautiful natural scenery, the empty, crumbling structures themselves are exceptional, including the ruins of a stunning cathedral and six churches. It fell to a succession of invaders contributing to the ruin\u2019s slow demise aided by deterioration over time, earthquakes, war, and vandalism.<br \/>\n<strong>History.<\/strong> The history of Ani dates back to 5,000 B.C. to the Chalcolithic period.<br \/>\nAni&#8217;s first rise to prominence was in the 400s AD. At this time, it was a hilltop fortress that belonged to the Armenian Kamsarakan Dynasty; by the 800s, however, the Kamsarakan possessions in Eastern Anatolia had merged with the Bagratid Dynasty. In 956, King Ashot III of the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia moved the Armenian capital to Ani, and Armenian Catholics followed. It remained the capital until 1045.<br \/>\nThe city of Ani prospered as the undisputed center of Armenia in the tenth and eleventh centuries flourishing as a branch of the Silk Road with more than 100,000 citizens controlling the greater area of what is today northeast Turkey and Armenia.<br \/>\nHowever, following the death of King Gagik in 1020, Armenian power was split between two sons and the\u00a0golden age\u00a0ended. The son who controlled Ani, attempting to prevent invasion, named the Byzantine Emperor his heir. The new king of Ani tried to keep his city independent, but after three years of military defeats and a pro-Byzantine uprising, Ani surrendered and the Byzantines established control.<br \/>\nThe city of Ani survived for another 650 years, but it was now a provincial town at the edge of competing empires. In 1064 the Seljuk Turks took the city and massacred the populace. The Seljuks passed possession to Kurdish Shaddadids who were conquered in 1199 by Queen Tamar of Georgia, and the Zakarid Dynasty of Ani was established. The city prospered once again but was devastated this time in 1236 by the invading Mongol Hordes. The city was damaged by an earthquake in 1319. After the death of Timur who captured Ani in the 1380s, the Persian Safavids regained control, but they transferred their capital to Yerevan. They ruled Ani as the vassals of various Turkic and Persian Empires until it became a part of the Ottoman Empire in 1579.<br \/>\nThe site of Ani was totally abandoned by 1735 when the last monks left the monastery in the Virgin&#8217;s Fortress. In 1878, Kars region was incorporated into the Russian Empire. Rediscovered and romanticized in the 19th century, the city had a brief moment of fame, only to be closed off by World War I, and with the 1921 treaty of Kars Ani became a part of the land of the Republic of Turkey. Later events of the Armenian Genocide left the region an empty, militarized no man&#8217;s land. After. The ruins crumbled at the hands of many: looters, vandals, Turks who tried to eliminate Armenian history from the area, clumsy archaeological digs, well-intentioned people who made poor attempts at restoration, and Mother Nature herself.<br \/>\nDespite the corrosive effects of time and human interaction, the ruins of Ani continue to fascinate travelers, an eerie, abandoned city of ruins spanning three centuries and five empires.<br \/>\nIt wasn\u2019t until the first half of the 19th century that European travelers happened upon the ruins of Ani and began to write about their impressions in academic journals and travel accounts. In 1878, Ani as part of the Russian Empire\u2019s Transcaucasian region, the first archaeological excavations took place by the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. During WWI, when Ottoman armies captured Kars in 1918, the Russian-led archaeologists did what they could to salvage the remains of the ancient city and fled to modern-day Armenia and they continue to be on display at the Yerevan State Museum of Armenian History. During the Turkish War of Independence, Turkey ordered that the &#8220;monument of Ani be wiped off the face of the earth.&#8221; The commander did not obey, fortunately, so the monuments of Ani remain. On the other hand, however, Russian excavations and repairs were undone, and the site languished under what can be most favorably described as neglect. Sadly, the remaining artifacts were either looted or destroyed, leaving Ani in the dilapidated state in which it continues to live today.<br \/>\nDespite Ani\u2019s history as a field of warfare, the ruins also represent many periods throughout history where the city saw a remarkable interchange of cultures, religions and artistic motifs.<br \/>\n<strong>Cathedral of Ani<\/strong> (Surp Asdvadzadzin), Construction of the structure began in 989, completed in either 1001 or 1010 under the reign of Armenian King Gagik I, when the wealth and population of Ani were at its peak. Trdat, the renowned Armenian architect who designed it, also served the Byzantines by helping them repair the dome of the Hagia Sophia. Its Gothic architecture is a style that the Ani cathedral predates by several centuries. Designed as a domed cruciform church, both the dome and the drum supporting it collapsed in an earthquake in 1319. Centuries later, another earthquake destroyed its northwest corner \u2013 it is still imposing in scale with its rust-coloured brick Turkey launched a project to conserve the ancient cathedral and a church in what is seen as a gesture of reconciliation toward neighboring Armenia.<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-s\/09\/ca\/ca\/58\/ani-katedrali.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Cathedral of Ani\" width=\"542\" height=\"407\" \/><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/static.wixstatic.com\/media\/1298b9_19707a2276af409da8af17352f5fde65~mv2.jpg\/v1\/fill\/w_1024,h_683,al_c,q_90\/file.jpg\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"542\" height=\"362\" \/><br \/>\n<strong>Surp Stephanos Church<\/strong>.

It is the best-preserved monument at Ani. A domed hall fronted by a ruined narthex and a small chapel, the exterior of the church is spectacularly decorated. Ornate stone carvings of real and imaginary animals fill the spandrels between blind arcades that run around all four sides of the church. The interior contains an important and unique series of frescoes cycles that depict two main themes. In the eastern third of the church is depicted the Life of\u00a0Saint Gregory the Illuminator, in the middle third of the church is depicted the Life of Christ. Such extensive fresco cycles are rare features in Armenian architecture \u2013 it is believed that these were executed by Georgian artists, and the cycle also includes scenes from the life of St. Nino, who converted the Georgians to Christianity.

Others argue that the structure was built as a mosque from the ground up, and thus was the first Turkish mosque in Anatolia.

The third wall was constructed at the order of Ani Bey, Ebul Menucehir in 1064-1072 after Seljuk Sultan Alparslan conquered Ani in 1064, and strengthened later by his Bagratid family of kings they encircled the entire city making for a formidable defense in the bloody conflicts between the Bagratids and the Byzantines, and the Byzantines and the Seljuks. On the northern side, the only part of the site not protected by rivers or ravines was a double line of walls with three gateways &#8211; the Lion Gate, the Kars Gate, and the Dvin Gate (also known as the Chequer-Board Gate because of a panel of red and black stone squares over its entrance).

I wanted to go to Kurdistan Iraq but Google Maps only showed routes through Iran and NW Iraq, both visa impossibilities. I Googled Turkey\/Kurdistan border crossings and got two: Zete supposedly just opened in 2018 in the corner next to the Iran border, a 275kms, 3\u00bd hour drive, or the Ibrahim Khalil border crossing, the main tourist and truck crossing (and the only one before 2018). The problem Google Maps did not show Zete as even existing. <\/em><br \/>\n<em>The drive to the mythical Zete took me over 3 mountain passes \u2013 2730m with slush and -4\u00b0C temperatures, 2110m and clear, and 1900m just before \u015eemdinli and the border. The highways are superb in Turkey and these were no exception \u2013 fast 4-lane or good 2-lane when the other is not possible. After the first pass, an odd reinforced concrete box canal had been constructed to carry the stream. Often it was above the level of the highway in the extremely narrow canyon. <\/em><br \/>\n<em>The trip was basically through snow-covered mountains dropping down into valley floors with none. As I neared Iraq, there was a large military presence with many checkpoints. But they were all very pleasant.<br \/>\nIn fact, Zete didn&#8217;t exist. I turned around and drove back to Y\u00fcksekova. It was almost dark so I simply parked on the side of the highway outside of town for the night. I ate and played bridge until late then all of a sudden was surrounded by several military vehicles with an angry man who spoke no English. After a thorough search and many questions translated on the phone, I was told this was a dangerous place and had to go into town. It had started snowing. I drove into Y\u00fcksekova and parked at a gas station. The forecast was for heavy snow. I thought I was screwed \u2013 in the middle of the mountains surrounded by high passes, only 4-season tires, but had faith in the great Turkish road system and their winter maintenance. <\/em><br \/>\n<em>In the morning, there was 4cm of snow on the ground and it was still snowing. I decided to head west through the mountains of southern Turkey towards the Iraq border. After some slush, the road became clear. One positive was that I was following a river, the \u00c7ataksuyu Stream, downhill. The roads got better and the snow, even on the mountains, disappeared. Besides missing a turn and having to deal with difficult soldiers, everything turned out great, at least for the time being. The road followed the same canyon that turned into a magnificent rugged gorge &#8211; big steep sloping plates of rock covered in green moss and then with green grass mixed with the ragged mountains. <\/em><br \/>\n<em>The next problem arose. Google Maps lost its navigation ability. This has happened before (in Kosovo) and one uses Google Maps Preview. It gives a route but no turns or instructions. It needs to be refreshed every 90 seconds and moved along the route manually.<\/em><br \/>\n<em>I reached a turn where the road left the river. I could go south through the Turkey\/Iraq border at \u00dcz\u00fcml\u00fc or the long way around through the Ibrahim Khalil border crossing, the normal and main entry into Kurdistan. <\/em><br \/>\n<em>The Turkish military pointed me to \u00dcz\u00fcml\u00fc. There were no road signs and the road switch backed high up to the top of the mountain where the border was. After the usual bureaucratic mess of Turkish immigration (but eased by the help of one nice guy who spoke English), I finally got to Iraq immigration for another big disappointment. I could cross here but my vehicle couldn\u2019t!!!! Turkey closed their border for an hour at 1:30 and a nice Kurd who spoke good English invited me for a Kurdish lunch of rice, dark noodles, fried chicken and bean soup. In the 3 years, he had worked at this crossing, I was the first native English speaker and the first Westerner. I had to endure Turkish immigration again. I told the nice guy he was the best Turkish immigration officer I had seen. He wasn\u2019t Turkish but a Kurd!<\/em><br \/>\n<em>So I returned down the mountain to the river and turned west up through more mountains, over a couple of low passes and finally turned southwest as directed by Google Maps. In a village, the entrance to the road was so insignificant that I missed it twice. It started as narrow rough pavement that climbed to one of the more unusual roads I have travelled \u2013 new, wide, cement, no painted lines, a sharp 15 cm shoulder, and a slight corrugated feel due to pouring lines every \u2154m. It seemed to climb forever and then went along the top of the mountains for several kilometres. At one point it continued off the indicated map on Google Maps. It ended at a heavily guarded military checkpoint, also the \u201cend of the road\u201d. The road shown on Google Maps was undrivable.<br \/>\nAfter many questions and phone calls, I was given two soldiers in full combat gear and guns to take me to the town 60 km away that would give me access to the Iraq border \u2013 apparently for my safety as there were &#8220;terrorists in the area&#8221;. We took a different very steep road down to the original town and stopped at a military base where I was taken in for questioning.
