Pakistan is home and heir to the famous Indus Valley civilization, which is amongst the oldest in the world. The earliest archaeological traces of Ancient Pakistanis are from 7000 BC in Mehrgarh, which grew to be the &#8220;Indus Valley Civilization&#8221;. By 3300 BC, this civilization had well-planned towns and well-laid roads, but gave no evidence of weapons or fortifications. This declined and disintegrated around 1900 BC, possibly due to drought and geological disturbances. Most historians say that the Vedic people, or Aryans, were later migrants, who encountered a civilization in decline and perhaps hastened that decline. According to this view, the Vedic people eventually occupied most of North India, while the descendants of the Indus Valley cultures moved south and gave rise to the Dravidian culture. The minority view challenges this Aryan Migration theory, claiming that the\u00a0Indus Valley people\u00a0were in fact the ones who compiled the Vedas.<br \/>\nPrior to the 1st of November in 1857 colonial rule the area of Pakistan was the area from which the Muslims ruled over Central and Southern Asia for over 1,000 years. Because Pakistan was India it thus became part of the Imperial Indian Empire, both the countries share some of the history in the region but separated in 1947 in favour of self-rule due to state-led suppression of Muslims in British India.<br \/>\nThe official name of Pakistan was used after the Independence and partitions of Bengal and the Punjab provincial regions within the former (British) India into the two sovereign nation-states of\u00a0Modern India\u00a0(Hindustan) and\u00a0Pakistan\u00a0in 1947. However, the word Pakistan was first used by Ch. Rehmat Ali back in 1933 in his declaration,\u00a0Now or Never\u00a0&#8211; calling for its separation from the Empire. Afterward, British-ruled India was divided into the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. A dispute over the Occupied territory of\u00a0Indian-administered Kashmir\u00a0is ongoing between\u00a0Republic of India\u00a0and\u00a0Pakistan\u00a0ever since 1947, three direct wars have been fought and over for this geostrategic Himalayan region respectively. Pakistan has lost two of those three wars.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Terrain. <\/strong>Pakistan is one of those few countries in the world which has every kind of geological structure. It has the sea, desert (Sindh &amp; Punjab), green mountains (North West Province), dry mountains (Balochistan), mountains covered with ice, rivers, rich land to cultivate (Punjab &amp; Sindh), water resources, water falls, forests etc. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan contain the mountain ranges of the Himalayas, the Karakoram, and the Hindu Kush. Pakistan&#8217;s highest point is K2, at 8,611m which is the second highest peak in the world. The Punjab province is a flat, alluvial plain whose rivers eventually join the Indus River and flow south to the Arabian Sea. Sindh lies between the Thar Desert the Rann of Kutch to the east, and the Kirthar range to the west. The Balochistan Plateau is arid and surrounded by dry mountains. Pakistan experiences frequent earthquakes, occasionally severe, especially in north and west.<br \/>\n<strong>Climate. <\/strong>Mostly hot, dry desert; temperate in northwest; arctic in north.

Beware of anyone who insists on helping you- they won&#8217;t be so friendly when demanding you pay them. Furthermore, there is NO special airport tax due at check-in, despite what your check-in clerk might tell you.<br \/>\n<strong>By train.<\/strong>\u00a0Pakistan has train links with India and Iran, though none of these trains are the fastest or most practical way to enter Pakistan. Should speed be a priority it is better to take the bus, or if you are really in a hurry, to fly, however the trains are sights in their own right.\u00a0From\u00a0India: The Samjhauta Express\u00a0runs on Tuesdays and Fridays between\u00a0Delhi\u00a0and\u00a0Lahore\u00a0via the\u00a0Attari\/Wagah\u00a0border crossing. This is the most common option chosen by travellers, however, tourists should be aware that after recent terrorist attacks on the train, which caused many a casualty and strained relationships between the two neighbours, it is strongly advised that you take taxis or buses to and from the border instead.<br \/>\nThe Thar Express\u00a0runs from\u00a0Bhagat ki Kothi\u00a0in the Indian state of\u00a0Rajasthan\u00a0to\u00a0Karachi\u00a0in Pakistan&#8217;s Sindh province. This route restarted in February 2006 after 40 years out of service, but is\u00a0not\u00a0currently open to foreign tourists.<br \/>\n<strong>By car.<\/strong>\u00a0From ancient times people have been travelling through Pakistan using the Grand Trunk Road and the\u00a0Silk Road\u00a0that run through Pakistan and into the\u00a0Indian subcontinent. It&#8217;s a rewarding but time consuming way to see this part of the world. New highways have been developed and the country is due for an expansion in its highway network. A world-class motorway connects the cities of\u00a0Peshawar,\u00a0Islamabad,\u00a0Lahore, and\u00a0Faisalabad.<br \/>\nFrom\u00a0China:\u00a0Pakistan is connected to China by the\u00a0Karakoram Highway, a modern feat of engineering that traverses a remarkably scenic route through the Karakoram and Himalayan mountains. Plans are in place for this highway to be expanded from its current width of 10m to 30m as a result of the increase in trade traffic due to Gwader port opening.<br \/>\n<strong>From\u00a0Afghanistan:<\/strong> The\u00a0Khyber Pass\u00a0connects\u00a0Peshawar\u00a0to\u00a0Jalalabad\u00a0and\u00a0Kabul\u00a0and requires an armed escort and a permit to travel through the tribal regions between\u00a0Peshawar\u00a0and the border. Onward travel from the border to\u00a0Kabul\u00a0is of questionable safety, check the current situation locally.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Bolan Pass\u00a0connects\u00a0Quetta\u00a0to\u00a0Kandahar\u00a0and is considered\u00a0very dangerous. This route is\u00a0not\u00a0currently open to foreign tourists, and is only open to locals and aid workers.<br \/>\n<strong>By bus<\/strong>. From India: While there is international service running from\u00a0Delhi\u00a0to\u00a0Lahore\u00a0it is just as fast, much more flexible, and much cheaper to take the journey by stringing together local transport and crossing the border on foot. As of October 2009, the bus was Rs. 1500. The journey details can be found here:\u00a0http:\/\/dtc.nic.in\/lahorebus.htm. You cannot buy the ticket on the spot, rather you will need to show up a few days before at Delhi Gate with photocopies of your Pakistani and Indian visas. The bus leaves at 6 a.m. but you will need to be at Delhi Gate at 4 a.m. to check in for it.<br \/>\nFrom China: You can take a bus from\u00a0Kashgar\u00a0over the\u00a0Karakoram Highway\u00a0to Pakistan.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GET AROUND\u00a0<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Maps.<\/strong> There are three good online maps for Pakistan;\u00a0Naqsha, and\u00a0Google Maps. Whilst the cities are well covered, roads in rural areas are not, with many minor roads missing &#8211; Google Maps in particular has a worrying habit of marking dried up river beds as minor roads, so if exploring out in the sticks it is a good idea to use Google Earth to double check your route.<br \/>\n<strong>By plane.<\/strong> Pakistan International Airlines\u00a0(PIA)\u00a0serves numerous domestic destinations and is the only airline to serve the three airports in the north of interest to trekkers or climbers:\u00a0Chitral,\u00a0Gilgit, and\u00a0Skardu. There are usually two flights from Islamabad to these cities daily, but they are often canceled due to bad weather, and often over-booked \u2014 show up early to guarantee a seat.<br \/>\nOther domestic carriers include\u00a0Shaheen Air International\u00a0and\u00a0Airblue.<br \/>\n<strong>By train.<\/strong> Pakistan Railway\u00a0provides passenger rail service. The stations tend not to have their timetables in English, but sales agents can usually explain everything to you. There are several different classes of fares depending on amenities. Foreign tourists and students with an ISIC card can get 25% and 50% discounts, respectively, by first visiting the PTDC (Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation) office, getting q verification certificate there, and bringing it with them to the train&#8217;s commercial ticket office (which is different from the regular ticket office, but usually close by).<br \/>\n<strong>By bus.<\/strong> A large portion of travel between cities in Pakistan is carried out by bus. Travelling between Karachi and any of the country&#8217;s other major cities by bus may take days, travel by bus is often the cheapest and most convenient alternative. The Daewoo Sammi company\u00a0runs a regular bus service between several major cities, with air-conditioned buses and seats booked one day ahead. While rather unexpensive, they are still almost five times as expensive as the cheap and uncomplicated rides offered by minibuses or larger buses between the major bus stations of the cities.<br \/>\nNorthern Areas Transport Corporation (NATCO)\u00a0runs buses between Islamabad and Gilgit-Baltistan region. Fares are often (though not always) paid directly on the bus, there is no air conditionin , and sometimes very little knee space, but you get where you are going all the same, and I have never met with anything but kind interest and friendly conversation on my many rides. Buses leave almost incessantly from the major bus stations for all the major cities, and many smaller locations, so booking ahead is neither possible nor necessary on the simpler buses. When travelling between major cities, smaller buses are to be preferred over the larger ones, as the larger ones tend to take up passengers along the way, and therefore travel more slowly.<br \/>\nThe situation is similar for local transport. While the organization of local transport may look a little different between cities, there is usually an active bus service running through the city, with varying levels of government control.<br \/>\n<strong>By rickshaw.<\/strong> For local transport within cities, auto rickshaws are a cheap and flexible alternative. A development of the bicycle rickshaw, the auto rickshaw is a small vehicle powered by a two-stroke or four-stroke engine. The original gasoline versions constantly emit a stuttering noise and foul blue-black smoke, but many are opting for the\u00a0CNG\u00a0(compressed natural gas) versions, which are less polluting and a little quieter. Blue-and-yellow auto rickshaws take passengers, other colours tend to be privately owned. Always negotiate a price before entering the rickshaw.<br \/>\n<strong>By ride sharing\/taxi cab services<\/strong>.\u00a0Companies like\u00a0Uber\u00a0and\u00a0Careem\u00a0offer ride-sharing\/taxi cab services at an affordable price. They are often cheaper than conventional taxi cabs and have a fix fare rate. You don&#8217;t need to negotiate the fare beforehand with the drivers which is a big plus. These companies offer their services in almost every major city like Lahore, Karachi, Quetta, Peshawar, Islamabad, and Rawalpindi, etc. Beware that you do need an Internet connection and their mobile apps installed on your phone to avail their services. You can pay the fare either by cash or by your credit card. If you want to travel even more cheaper within cities you can use bike sharing services like\u00a0bykea\u00a0which allow you to travel on a motorcycle. They offer their services in Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Karachi.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Talk.\u00a0<\/strong>Urdu\u00a0is the &#8220;National language&#8221; and is spoken throughout Pakistan as a\u00a0lingua franca. In addition to Urdu most Pakistanis speak their regional languages or dialects such as\u00a0Punjabi,\u00a0Pothohari,\u00a0Sindhi,\u00a0Pashto\u00a0(Pushtun),\u00a0Balochi,\u00a0Saraiki,\u00a0Shina,\u00a0Burushaski,\u00a0Khowar,\u00a0Wakhi,\u00a0Hindko\u00a0etc.<br \/>\nPakistani English is designated as the &#8220;Official language&#8221; used in all government and most educational purpose and business entities, and is also understood and spoken at varying levels of competence by many people around Pakistan, especially the upper classes and people who have gone through higher levels of education, and those residing in the larger cities. In the\u00a0Punjab_(Pakistan)\u00a0region, Hindi is also well understood because of its close proximity to the border with\u00a0Delhi\u00a0and other cities inside\u00a0Punjab_(India).<\/p>\n<p><strong>EAT<\/strong><br \/>\nPakistani food mainly consists of various kinds of curries eaten with either flatbread or rice. Food tends range from mild to spicy depending on where you are and who your cook is. So state your preference before beginning to eat.<br \/>\n<strong>Naan<\/strong> is usually used to pick up liquid and soft foods like shorba and beans. Forks and knives not commonly used during meals in Pakistan (unless someone is eating rice or is dining out). Attempting to cut a naan with a knife may elicit some amusement around you). Several tyrpes of naan.\u00a0<em>Naan<\/em> &#8211; A soft and thick flat bread that often requires special clay ovens (tandoor) and cannot be properly made on home stoves. <em>Roti\/Chapatti<\/em> &#8211; A homemade bread, much thinner than naan and usually made out of unrefined flour, and which is ready in minutes. <em>Paratha<\/em> &#8211; An extremely oily version of the roti. Usually excellent if you&#8217;re going out to eat, but beware of health concerns; often it is literally dripping with oil because it is meant to be part of a rich meal. Paratha is more declicious if you cook it in pure oil like &#8220;desi ghee&#8221;. <em>Sheer Mal<\/em> &#8211; This is a slightly sweetened, lightly oiled bread that has waffle-like squares punched in it. It is often considered the most desirable bread and is a delicacy to most people. Often paired with nihari.

Common to all economic classes.<br \/>\nX +\u00a0ki sabzi\u00a0&#8211; A vegetarian mixture with &#8216;X&#8217; as the main ingredient.<br \/>\n<strong>Meat:<\/strong>\u00a0Aloo Gosht (Potatoes and Meat) &#8211; Chunks of potato and goat meat in gravy. Levels of spice vary.\u00a0Nihari- Beef simmered for several hours. A delicacy often eaten with\u00a0Nan,\u00a0Sheer Mal, or\u00a0Taftan. Few people will have this available without spice. Eat with lemon, fried onion and caution: it is one of the spiciest curries. Paye &#8211; or &#8216;Siri Paye&#8217; is a stew of goat\/beef\/mutton\/bacon bones (typically hooves, skull) and bone marrow. Extremely nutritious and generally eaten for breakfast with naan.<br \/>\n<strong>Desserts. <\/strong>Ice cream traditional pistachio flavoured Kulfi. Mixed with vermicelli, pistachio nuts and flavored with rose-water.<br \/>\nShirini or Mithai: is the generic name for a variety of popular sweet treats in Pakistan. Eat small chunks at a time, eating large pieces can be rude and will generally be too sweet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ACCOMMODATION<\/strong><br \/>\nPakistan, as a middle income country with a sizeable middle class and significant domestic tourism industry has a decent range of hotels covering all price ranges. International tourists often are disappointed by the cleanliness of Pakistani hotels &#8211; bedding is often clean but bathrooms can be a bit grungy. Currently Pakistan is facing a significant slump in international tourist numbers, in the northern areas in particular you&#8217;ll find yourself the only guests.<br \/>\n<strong>Budget<\/strong>\u00a0The cheapest hotels are usually found around busy transportation hubs like bus and train stations. Don&#8217;t be fooled by an impressive lobby &#8211; ask to see the room and check the beds, toilets, lights, etc before checking in. Hot water and air conditioning will be luxuries in this class.<br \/>\n<strong>Mid range<\/strong>\u00a0covers a wide spectrum of hotels &#8211; often listed in your guide book or online. All mid-range places will have a\/c and hot water &#8211; although check if they have a working generator &#8211; air conditioning isn&#8217;t of much use without electricity! Always check the room before handing over any money &#8211; ask for a no smoking room away from the street &#8211; and haggle to get a better rate. PTDC (government run) hotels fall in to the mid range section and warrant a special mention &#8211; often these places are the oldest hotel in town, in an excellent location, but the facilities will be showing their age. They are still a good option however, and discounts can be negotiated. Mid range prices are around Rs2,000 &#8211; Rs6,000 per night.<br \/>\n<strong>Top end<\/strong>\u00a0covers the Serenas, Pearl Continentals and Marriotts. The Serena hotels are almost always excellent, whilst the Pearl Continental hotels are more patchy (eg the one in\u00a0Rawalpindi\u00a0is a bit grungy whilst the one in\u00a0Muzaffarabad\u00a0is very nice. At top-end places security is very visible, with small armies of security guards stationed around the perimeter. Prices are from Rs6,000 and up, with the big city luxury hotels charging at least Rs10,000 a night.<br \/>\n<strong>Government rest houses<\/strong> are mentioned in numerous guide books and are located in rural and mountainous areas for local civil servants to use on their travels, with many built pre-independence and exuding a quaint English charm. Back in the day the adventurous tourist could book these places for the night for Rs1,000 or so, and have a lovely time. But the tourist slump means that the forestry departments who run these places don&#8217;t bother any more &#8211; phones will go unanswered &#8211; tourist information offices won&#8217;t have any details etc. so count yourself lucky if you manage to arrange to stay in a Government rest house.<br \/>\nSolo female travelers\u00a0are at a disadvantage when it comes to hotels. All budget and many mid-range places will be the sole reserve of men, in particular in the cities &#8211; and hotel owners may be uncomfortable with the idea of an unaccompanied women staying at their hotel. Hence you may be forced to stay at the upper-mid range and top end places &#8211; which will eat through your budget that much quicker.<br \/>\nNote that in some places the term &#8220;hotel&#8221; in Pakistan is reserved for simpler establishments, with &#8220;Guest House&#8221; referring to medium-sized establishments where the standard is typically higher. Also note that restaurants are also called &#8220;hotels&#8221;, creating a fun potential for confusion.<\/p>\n<p><strong>STAY SAFE<br \/>\n<\/strong>People in Pakistan are very hospitable. Dont feel unsafe if people there offer you help without a particular reason. They sometimes even give gifts to foreigners just to make them feel home.<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong>Avoid going out at night especially in the city of Karachi that is notorious for its high crime rate, though it has decreased significantly in the past few years. Prostitution is now legalised in Karachi. Many high end brothels emerged in posh areas. Safety should be maintained before visiting any of these.<br \/>\nBe aware of\u00a0sensitive areas. You may see road signs in English saying &#8216;no foreigners allowed beyond this point&#8217; &#8211; for example on the road to Kahuta near Islamabad. If you see and need to pass one of these signs at the very least stop at the nearest police station and see if they will let you pass (speaking Urdu is an advantage here), or turn back and find another route. Typically, restricted areas are those with nuclear or military installations nearby. Kahuta, southeast of Islamabad, and the Sakesar hill station near the Amb temples in the Salt Range are two restricted areas the visitor may stumble across. Getting caught in a restricted area will mean a lot of wasted time, embarrassment and the possible involvement of your embassy.<br \/>\nProtests can occur without warning in the country. As a result, there is heavy security present in the larger cities. Avoid the protests if they are intense at all costs as they can turn into riots which may sometimes end up deadly. Simple protests are safe especially the ones which include womens as the literate people in Pakistan respect them greatly.<br \/>\nStay away from military convoys as they are a potential target for suicide bombing. Similarly, going near military or intelligence facilities can be dangerous.<br \/>\n<strong>Kashmir<\/strong> is a particularly sensitive topic and best avoided altogether. The line of control between the Pakistan occupied Kashmir and its Indian counterpart is off-limits for foreign tourists, though domestic tourists can visit &#8216;Azad Kashmir&#8217; without any restriction (but should keep their identity cards with them).<br \/>\n<strong>Religion.<\/strong> Discussion about religion and Islam should remain respectful and pos<\/p>\n<p><strong>Health.<\/strong> Don&#8217;t drink\u00a0tap water; many Pakistani locals themselves drink boiled or purified water. Ice is usually made from regular tap-water, and may be even harder to avoid. Haleeb Milk and Olpers are trusted brands and are available at most grocery stores.<br \/>\nTake precautions against malaria spread by mosquitoes. Avoid getting bitten and if you plan to stay in a place where malaria is common take prophylactic medication. The risk of getting Malaria decreases with higher altitudes.<br \/>\nSummers are very hot, so be careful to stay hydrated. Temperatures range between 40 and 50\u00b0C in June and July, but as soon as the monsoon rains set in during August and September, things cool to around 30\u00b0C but with high levels of humidity.<br \/>\nDo not eat food that has been lying out for some time, as high temperatures speed up deterioration. Avoid posh restaurants with only a sporadic client\u00e8le.<br \/>\nDengue fever in the summer, especially during the monsoon (Jul-Sept) especially in the Punjab province.<\/p>\n<p><strong>RESPECT<\/strong><br \/>\nPakistanis pride themselves on their tradition of hospitality to guests. When entering a house, you will often be showered with tea, sweets and gifts \u2014 it&#8217;s considered ungrateful to refuse these. Finishing a meal involves a delicate balance&#8230;. cleaning your plate will invite more to be served, while leaving too much may be a sign you didn&#8217;t care for it. Aim for leaving just a little, announcing you&#8217;re full, and heavily praise the food.<br \/>\nMost of the Pakistani women don&#8217;t usually interact with strangers. So, don&#8217;t get embarrassed if they avoid communicating with you.<br \/>\n<strong>Women.<\/strong> Pakistan is a conservative country and it is advisable for visiting women to wear long skirts or trousers in public as traditionally Pakistani women are not allowed to wear bra and panties. Pakistani women wear the traditional shalwar kameez but in the big cities, women wearing jeans and khakis is not very uncommon sight, especially in casual settings, shopping malls and around picnic spots. Dress codes for men are more lax, though shorts are uncommon. Men should\u00a0never\u00a0shake hands with or touch a woman they don&#8217;t know very well.<br \/>\nAs with most of South Asia, you should use your right hand for eating, shaking hands and giving or receiving anything, including money.<br \/>\nThings to avoid<br \/>\n<strong>Politics.<\/strong>\u00a0Be cautious when discussing politics. Pakistan is a politically troubled country. Social protests tend to turn violent and political demonstrations are almost always sensitive. You&#8217;ll be exposed to a breadth of political opinions as a visitor, even though many Pakistanis are often frustrated and dismayed with the direction of the country. Don&#8217;t hesitate to engage in political discussions, but it&#8217;s worth mentioning that being a visitor puts you in a delicate position.<br \/>\n<strong>Religion.<\/strong> Be cautious when discussing religion. Discussion about religion and Islam should remain respectful and positive. Blasphemy is illegal in Pakistan. Avoid talking against Islam or Islamic values.<br \/>\n<strong>Kashmir.<\/strong> Be cautious when talking about the Kashmir conflict. Pakistanis in general regard Kashmir as a part of Pakistan, and depending on your views, it can quickly turn into a fierce, passionate, or hostile debate. As a general rule, it is best to refrain from bringing up the subject.<br \/>\nIndia. Be cautious when talking about India. The two countries have had a hostile, strained, often violent history (3 wars among other skirmishes). Pakistanis usually have nothing against individual people from India. There are exceptions where anti-Indian sentiments exist and Indian visitors could face discrimination. It&#8217;s wise to refrain from discussing Indo-Pak political issues with Pakistanis.\u00a0It can result in some fierce debates and even violence.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CONTACT<br \/>\n<\/strong>Phone numbers are seven digits long with two digit city code in larger districts, and six digits long with three digit city code in smaller districts, for a total of nine digits as a standard nationwide (except for Azad Kashmir). All mobile numbers, however, are seven digits long and begin with a four digit city code &#8220;03XX&#8221;, where XX indicates the cellular provider. Thus Pakistani mobile numbers are linked to one particular cellular provider, NOT one particular city as in some other countries. Therefore the city prefix should not be dialled in addition to the cellular prefix. As in many countries, omit the initial zero when dialing a city or cell code from outside Pakistan and prefix the &#8217;92&#8217; country code after dialling your country&#8217;s international access code.<br \/>\nPublic Call Offices\u00a0can be found all over the country. You will find a PCO in nearly 50% of the general stores where there is usually someone who operates the phone and fax. Fees will be charged according to the time spent, and you will pay when you have finished your call.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Nomad Mania Pakistan<br \/>\nBorders<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Pakistan (sea
