At km. 19, we turned right onto the signed #200 and continued to a landing at the road\u2019s end at 29.7 km. Here, at Bear Pasture, 5600\u2019, we car camped (plenty of level space, ample parking, no water, no toilet). Books and signage caution the driver about difficult wilderness roads, but everything we drove was 2WD with very gentle grades. I guess they might present difficulties for your horse trailer or travel trailer. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">After a warm night, we found the bugs so bad that we skipped breakfast and headed out at 0650 on the well-signed, well-maintained Crowell Ridge Trail, #515. Fifty minutes of hiking got us to the crest of Crowell Ridge; there, the trail heads west toward Sullivan Mtn. From this spot, we followed a more sketchy trail east, stopping at point 6617\u2019 for a bug-free brekky. Continuing north on the adequate trail, we descended 200\u2019, scaled a small bump, traversed u\/n 6853\u2019 on the west or left side via a flagged route, and reached the top of u\/n 7177\u2019, south of Watch Lake, by 0850. Continuing down, up, and down to the northwest and north, we meandered over point 7033\u2019, and plodded up the final 550\u2019 to the summit by 0950 (no cairn, 3 hrs. up). In essence, there is a trail right to the top. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">During our 40 min. stay in breezy, pleasant weather, we identified Hooknose, Abercrombie, Salmo Mtn., Shedroof, Sullivan Mtn., Little Snowy Top, the three Snowy Tops, Ripple, Mt. Kelly, Siwash, Lost Mtn., and Old Glory, among others. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">We then made an uneventful return via the ascent route in 2 hrs. 35 min. for a 6 hr. 15 min., 3400\u2019 day. This two-ski-pole walk-up would make an excellent autumn trip, but the road access is closed after August 15th to leave the bears to harvest huckleberries in peace. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">In addition to the map mentioned above, we recommend 50 Hikes for Eastern Washington\u2019s Highest Mountains, by James P. Johnson. Sullivan Lake Ranger District Trail Guide (USDA) is also of some help. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Kim Kratky<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>GYPSY PEAK, NORTHEASTERN WASHINGTON, 7309\u2019, July 5, 2009 by Kim Kratky\u00a0 Map: Salmo-Priest Wilderness (US Forest Service) Janice and I decided to help the Americans celebrate their Fourth of July weekend by scaling this minor league but scenic peak, billed &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2017\/11\/13\/gypsy-peak\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-8253","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-uncategorized"],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p2Ncip-297","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8253","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8253"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8253\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":20544,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8253\/revisions\/20544"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8253"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8253"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8253"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
