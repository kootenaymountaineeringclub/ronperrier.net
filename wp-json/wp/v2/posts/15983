The fort&#8217;s wall is interspersed with several bastions, and three are of semi-circular shape. The northern part of the fort&#8217;s perimeter is a natural high hilly formation and the other three sides are covered by fort walls. Within this main fort, there is a smaller fort known as the &#8220;Miri Fort&#8221; which is about 3 km from the Sann gate and is reported to have served as the palace of the Mir royal family. The entire fort structure has been built with stone and lime mortar. The fort is built in a zig-zag form, with four entry gates in the shape of a rhomboid. The four gates are namely: Sann Gate, Amri Gate, Shah-Pere Gate, and Mohan Gate. Two of the gates, facing each other, are crossed diagonally by the Sann river; the first gate is on the western side and is skirted by the river water and is difficult to approach. The southern entry gate has a double doors gate. Within the gates, two niches have floral ornamentation and carved stones.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Sann gate is well preserved and can be climbed to reach the top of the fort from both sides to get a scenic view of the terrain around the fort.

It is located west of the Indus River, in Jamshoro District. Lake Manchar collects water from numerous small streams in the Kirthar Mountains and then empties into the Indus River. The lake&#8217;s surface area fluctuates with the seasons &#8211; from as little as 36 km\u00b2 to as much as 500 km\u00b2 during monsoon rains.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The lake was formed when a branch of the Indus River flowed from Kashmore. In 1958, the lake completely evaporated due to drought. Between 10 August and 23 August 2009, 700 cu ft\/s (20 m3\/s) of water was introduced into the lake via the Indus River. In the 2010 Pakistan floods, the lake overflowed due to a high inflow of water.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The average depth is only 2.5 to 3.75 metres.\u00a0It is 6 metres lower than the bed of the Indus and sometimes catches floodwater from the river, while in winter when the river is low, water flows from the lake into the Indus.\u00a0Rainfall in the area averages only 4.46 inches annually. The southern end of the lake is at the base of the Laki Hills, a branch of the\u00a0Kirthar Mountains.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The lake supports thousands of fisherfolk, who depend on the freshwater fish in the lake.\u00a0The lake since the construction of the Main Nara Valley Drain in 1921 has undergone environmental degradation with the inflow of sewage.\u00a0Consequently, the water quality of the Lake has been degraded.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The diversion of water from the Indus and diminished storm runoff from the Kirthar mountains have contributed to the reduction in freshwater supplies, resulting in the water becoming saline, and killing off fish. At the same time, saline drainage water from agricultural fields of Balochistan and surrounding areas flows into Lake Manchar. The lake was a stop-off on the Indus flyway for Siberian migratory birds, but recently the numbers have fallen from 25,000 birds counted in 1988 to just 2,800 birds counted in 2002 because the lake no longer provides the birds&#8217; main food, the lake fish. In the place of the birds, the lake now hosts a saline water reed.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The lake also provided large volumes of water for irrigation, but this has also been reduced and has resulted in a great reduction in the area irrigated by the lake. Right Bank Outfall Drain is being built to save the lake from contamination.\u00a0Construction of the\u00a0Nai Gaj Dam\u00a0upstream from the lake will result in freshwater being discharged into the lake throughout the year, instead of seasonally, which should improve the lake&#8217;s waters.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Lake Manchar is populated by the\u00a0Mohana\u00a0tribe, who are sometimes referred to as the &#8220;Boat People.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Archaeological Ruins at Moenjodaro<\/strong>\u00a0WHS. Meaning \u2018Mound of the Dead Men\u201d, it is an archaeological site built around 2500 BCE. It was one of the largest settlements of the ancient\u00a0Indus Valley Civilisation, and one of the world\u2019s earliest major\u00a0cities, contemporaneous with the civilizations of\u00a0ancient Egypt,\u00a0Mesopotamia,\u00a0Minoan Crete, and\u00a0Norte Chico. Mohenjo-daro was abandoned in the 19th century BCE as the Indus Valley Civilization declined, and the site was not rediscovered until the 1920s.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It is situated on a\u00a0ridge in the middle of the floodplain of the Indus River Valley, around 28 kilometres (17\u00a0mi) from the town of\u00a0Larkana. The subsequent flooding has since buried most of the ridge in silt deposits.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The\u00a0Harappan\u00a0Civilization spanned much of what is now Pakistan and North India, extending westwards to the\u00a0Iranian\u00a0border. Mohenjo-daro was the most advanced city of its time, with remarkably sophisticated civil engineering and urban planning. Mohenjo-daro has a\u00a0planned layout\u00a0with\u00a0rectilinear\u00a0buildings arranged on a\u00a0grid plan.\u00a0Most were built of fired and mortared\u00a0brick; some incorporated sun-dried\u00a0mud-brick\u00a0and wooden superstructures. A\u00a0\u201cweak\u201d estimate of a peak population is around 40,000.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Citadel \u2013 a mud-brick mound around 12 metres (39 ft) high \u2013 is known to have supported public baths, a large residential structure designed to house about 5,000 citizens, and two large assembly halls. The city had a central marketplace, with a large central well. Individual households or groups of households obtained their water from smaller wells. Wastewater was channelled to covered drains that lined the major streets. Some houses, presumably those of more prestigious inhabitants, include rooms that appear to have been set aside for bathing, and one building had an underground furnace (known as a hypocaust), possibly for heated bathing. Most houses had inner courtyards, with doors that opened onto side-lanes. Some buildings had two stories.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Mohenjo-daro had no series of city walls, and was fortified with guard towers, it is postulated that Mohenjo-daro was an administrative center.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Over 700 wells\u00a0(one for every three houses) are present alongside drainage and bathing systems,\u00a0unheard of when compared to other civilizations at the time, such as Egypt or Mesopotamia. The circular brick well design is credited to the Indus civilization. Sewage and wastewater for buildings at the site were disposed of via a centralized drainage system that ran alongside the site\u2019s streets emptying into the Indus River.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The city could have been flooded and silted over, perhaps six times.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Artifacts.

This is a rice country with some sugar cane. Water is copious from irrigation systems from the Indus River whose many channels cover a huge area. The country is dead flat making these crops easy. Others include bananas, and palms (both oil palms and date palms). Wetlands are common and there are a lot of trees.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">2. Rice straw is carried in the most enormous loads &#8211; on trucks and trailers pulled by tractors (often with a grill emblazoned with reflectors and decoration). The loads are piled high and wide, often overlapping the sides by up to 2 metres. The trucks often carry the straw in loads secured by cloth held together with ropes and logs that extend well past the box of the truck. Sugar cane is similar.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">3. Donkeys are the most common way to transport small loads on carts.
