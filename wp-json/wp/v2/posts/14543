The Crusaders occupied Syria and Palestine from 1098 to 1291 and when they controlled Ascalon in 1153, the last Fatimid bastion in Palestine, the way to the country of the Nile was left open.<br \/>\nSaladin controlled Egypt (1171) and had built one of the biggest citadels in the world in Cairo in 1166. Two citadels were repaired:<br \/>\nAl-Gundi where some ruins are still left 20 km from the Suez-Taba route in the open Sina\u00ef desert. It occupies a strategic position between the two gulfs, Suez and Aqaba along the land route for trade, pilgrimage and military purposes. It is built on a steep, 285 m high escarpment, difficult to climb especially on the northern and north-western side. Water came from the Ayn Sadr.<br \/>\nPharaoh&#8217;s island fortress in the middle of the Gulf of Aqaba and was occupied by the Crusaders. It is surrounded by a 2 m thick wall reinforced at regular intervals with square and round towers. There are three underground cisterns, all in a perfect state of conservation. It controlled the traffic between the three banks of the Gulf of Aqaba; from the north coming from Palestine and Syria, from the east from the Arab Peninsula and from the west from Sina\u00ef and from Egypt.<br \/>\nWhen the Crusades came to an end (1291) and a pilgrims&#8217; road was built passing through Eilat, it seems to have lost its importance and may even have been abandoned.

In 1858,\u00a0Ferdinand de Lesseps\u00a0formed the\u00a0Suez Canal Company and construction from 1859 to 1869. It reduced the journey from the Arabian Sea to London by approximately 8,900 kilometres (5,500\u00a0mi), or 8 days at 24knts.\u00a0The canal extends from the northern terminus of\u00a0Port Said\u00a0to the southern terminus of\u00a0Port Tewfik\u00a0at the city of\u00a0Suez. Its length is 193.30\u00a0km (120.11\u00a0mi) including its northern and southern access-channels. In 2020, more than 18,500 vessels traversed the canal (an average of 51.5 per day).<br \/>\nThe original canal featured a single-lane waterway with passing locations in the Ballah Bypass and the\u00a0Great Bitter Lake.\u00a0It contained\u00a0no\u00a0lock\u00a0systems, with seawater flowing freely through it. In general, the water in the canal north of the Bitter Lakes flows north in winter and south in summer. South of the lakes, the current changes with the\u00a0tide\u00a0at Suez.<br \/>\nWhile the canal was the property of the Egyptian government, European shareholders, mostly French and British, owned the\u00a0concessionary company\u00a0which operated it until July 1956, when\u00a0Nasser\u00a0nationalized it\u2014an event which led to the\u00a0Suez Crisis\u00a0of October\u2013November 1956.\u00a0The canal is operated and maintained by the state-owned\u00a0Suez Canal Authority\u00a0(SCA) of Egypt. Under the\u00a0Convention of Constantinople, it may be used &#8220;in time of war as in time of peace, by every vessel of commerce or of war, without distinction of flag.\u00a0Nevertheless, the canal has played an important military strategic role as a naval short-cut and\u00a0choke point. Navies with coastlines and bases on both the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea (Egypt\u00a0and\u00a0Israel) have a particular interest in the Suez Canal. After Egypt closed the Suez canal at the beginning of the\u00a0Six-Day War\u00a0on 5 June 1967, the canal remained closed for precisely eight years, reopening on 5 June 1975.<br \/>\nThe Egyptian government opened in 2015 and expansion and widening of the Ballah Bypass for 35\u00a0km (22\u00a0mi) to speed up the canal&#8217;s transit-time. The expansion intended to nearly double the capacity of the Suez Canal, from 49 to 97 ships per day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>PORT SAID <\/strong>(pop 603,787 2010).<br \/>\nIn north east\u00a0Egypt\u00a0extending 30 kilometres (19\u00a0mi) along the coast of the\u00a0Mediterranean\u00a0north of the\u00a0Suez Canal.

The lighthouse was constructed by layering liquid 20 \u2013 25\u00a0cm in thickness. To ensure the structural cohesion of the whole, iron wall ties were inserted. The use of concrete was doubly innovative: employed as a distinct material, not merely a substance for filling, and strengthened with metal rods.

On completion of the construction of the High Dam in the early 1970\u2019s, the Lake covered the entire Nubian Nile Valley in both Egypt and Sudanand deeply penetrated into the surrounding desert through the numerous wadis (dry desert rivers) that drained from the Eastern (the majority) and the Western Deserts, about 80 all in all, the largest of them being Wadi Allaqi. This gives the Lake its dendritic shape in satellite images. The climate is extremely arid with very hot summers and cold winters.<br \/>\nA yearly fluctuation of as much as 30 m and large wetlands have formed in the deltaic mouths of the dry wadis where they join the Lake.

One of the country&#8217;s main tourist centres located on the\u00a0Red Sea\u00a0coast\u00a0owing to its dramatic landscape, year-round dry and temperate climate and long stretches of natural beaches. Its waters are clear and calm for most of the year. Founded in 1905, it was a small fishing village, but it has grown into a major Red Sea holiday destination for Europeans starting in the 1980s. The city is known for its\u00a0watersports (windsurfing,\u00a0kitesurfing,\u00a0yachting,\u00a0scuba diving\u00a0and\u00a0snorkeling), nightlife and warm weather. Daytime temperatures are around 30\u00a0\u00b0C most of the year (July and August over 40\u00a0\u00b0C). Tourist numbers from Russia dropped significantly after the\u00a0Metrojet Flight 9268\u00a0plane crash in November 2015.<br \/>\nThe city extends for about 36 kilometres (22\u00a0mi) along the coast, but does not reach far into the surrounding desert. Dive sites around Abu Ramada Island,\u00a0Fanadir,\u00a0Giftun Kebir, and\u00a0Giftun Soraya\u00a0are popular. Tourists also visit shipwrecks such as the El Mina or the Rosalie Moller.
