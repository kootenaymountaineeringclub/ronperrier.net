Its landscape is incredibly varied. Its recent history has been tumultuous.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>PEOPLE<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Humans have inhabited the area that makes up modern Iran since the Stone Age. There are paintings in Dusheh cave that date back to 15,000 BC.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The ancient Persians arrived about 1500 BC, one branch of the great movement of people that also brought northern India and most of Europe their modern populations. The name Iran is from the same root as &#8220;Aryan&#8221; which, until Hitler perverted it, was just an ancient name for those arriving peoples. Persian (natively known as Farsi) is an Indo-European language; ancient Persian was related to Sanskrit, ancient Greek, and all the others in that family. Persians are ethnically and linguistically unrelated to their neighbours on the west, the Arabs and Turks, but are related to various groups to the east and north.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Iran has many people other than ethnic Persians; there are substantial minorities with their own languages, Minorities with Indo-European languages related to Persian include Kurds in parts of the west and northwest, Baluchis in parts of the southeast, and Armenians in the north and in Isfahanwhere one of the Shahs transported them a few centuries back. Minorities with Turkic languages include the Azeris who make up much of the population of Azerbaijan in the northwest and the Qashqai, a nomadic people in the region around Shiraz. There are also Arabs and, last but not least, Jews, who have been living in Iran peacefully for centuries.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">There are also two substantial communities of people of Iranian descent in India and Pakistan &#8211; Parsis who have been there for over 1,000 years, and Iranis who arrived in the 19th and 20th centuries &#8211; both Zoroastrians who fled religious persecution in Iran.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>HISTORY<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Persia has always exerted a large cultural influence on its neighbors, especially Afghanistan, the Caucasus and Central Asia. Persian influence can be seen in the art, architecture and languages of these areas, and in the Indian Subcontinent.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The empire existed over most of the time period from about 500 BCE until the revolution of 1979, but its fortunes varied enormously over the centuries. During the Achaemenid Empire, Persia controlled most of what we now call the Middle East, and after Cyrus the Great&#8217;s conquest of Ionia, Persia came close to conquering Greece in the Greco-Persian Wars of 499-449 BC. In 331 BC, Alexander conquered (among other places) the entire Persian Empire.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Sassanid<\/strong> rule from 205 AD to 651 AD is considered to be the most influential period of ancient Persia. In 651 AD, immediately after the death of Muhammad, the brutal conquest of Persia by the Arabs brought an end to the Sasanian Empire. Persian and other languages of the region are still written with the Arabic alphabet. In 1221 AD, Persia was overrun by Genghis Khan and the Mongols. Marco Polo passed through later in that century, learned Persian, and wrote extensively of the region. Tamerlane conquered Persia in 1383, and after a revolt in 1387, killed hundreds of thousands of people and built a tower with their skulls.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>The Safavid dynasty<\/strong> re-united Persia as an independent state in 1501, established Shi&#8217;a Islam as the official religion, and ushered in a golden age of Persian culture. The dynasty was overthrown in 1736 by Nader Shah, the last great Asian conqueror, who expanded the empire to again include Afghanistan and much of India. His short-lived dynasty and its successor, the Zand dynasty, lasted until 1795.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>The Qajar dynasty<\/strong> ruled from 1795-1925. While many of the historic buildings in Iran are from this period, this era is considered to be one of decline for Iran, as the rulers were more interested in building their collections of art and jewels and succumbed to heavy pressure from foreign powers, notably Britain and Russia who jointly occupied Iran during World War I. In 1906, Qajar rule became a constitutional monarchy and the Majlis (Persian for parliament) was established.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>The Last Dynasty.\u00a0<\/strong>In 1925, a military coup by Reza Shah established a new &#8220;Pahlavi&#8221; dynasty, named for the most ancient Persian dynasty around 500 BC. His rule was quite nationalistic; he changed the country&#8217;s name from Persia to Iran, and built a strong military. He was also quite authoritarian; he built a powerful secret police and a propaganda apparatus, and did not hesitate to crush dissent. He also made considerable efforts toward modernization, and came into conflict with conservatives over some of it.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">When World War II came, he refused Allied demands for guarantees that Iran would resist if German forces got that far. Iran was then invaded by Anglo-Indian forces from the south and Russians from the north, and a railway was built (largely by US Army engineers) to bring supplies from the Persian Gulf across Iran to beleaguered Russia. Reza Shah went off to exile in South Africa, abdicating on the steps of the aircraft in favour of his son.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The son, Mohammad Reza Shah, continued his father&#8217;s nationalistic, authoritarian and modernising tendencies. As Iranian ruler he couldn&#8217;t choose Britain or Russia as allies. Being pro-German had not worked out well for his father and France wasn&#8217;t strong enough at the time. That left the Americans, and he became one of America&#8217;s most important allies in the region, seen as a &#8220;bulwark against Communism&#8221;, a constitutional monarch, in some ways a progressive ruler \u2014 modernising, sometimes comparing himself to Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk who led Turkey&#8217;s modernisation \u2014 and a protector of US and other Western interests. He was one of very few Middle Eastern rulers to extend diplomatic recognition to Israel and helped prevent Iranian nationalisation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. On the other hand, he was quite capable of putting Iranian interests before Western ones, as when he was one of the key players in creating OPEC.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">While in some ways progressive, the Shah was also very much a despot. When the Soviets left Northwestern Iran after the war, they left behind something that claimed to be an independent communist government of Azerbaijan. The first major conflict of the Cold War came as the Shah, advised by the CIA, brought in troops who crushed that government and the Communist Party (<i>Tudeh<\/i> in Farsi). Throughout his reign, his Savak secret police stomped hard on any opposition. His regime was also massively corrupt, with his relatives and various others getting hugely rich while much of the country was very poor. On the other hand, he did build infrastructure and start various projects to benefit the poor, including a program that sent new university graduates into the countryside as teachers.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In theory, Iran under the Shah was a constitutional monarchy. Mohammed Mosaddeq was elected Prime Minister in 1951 and instituted reforms that included nationalizing the oil companies and a land reform program, and also limited the power of the Shah as part of a constitutional monarchy. He was overthrown in a 1953 coup backed by the CIA, the British (who had large oil interests at stake), and the Shah. The Shah and the new Prime Minister reversed the oil nationalization, but continued with the land reform program. However, as well as giving land to the peasants, it worked out that the Shah&#8217;s family and others with connections got a lot. The Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini went into exile at this time because of his objections to land reform taking land from the mosques. In 1971, the Shah organised an expensive celebration of the 2,500th anniversary of the Persian Empire at Persepolis. The extravagant party resulted in harsh criticism and his popularity ratings never recovered.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In 1979, the Shah was overthrown and went into exile, dying a year later. The revolution involved many groups &#8211; Mosaddeq-style secular reformers, the <i>tudeh<\/i> communists, and various Islamic factions &#8211; but came to be led and dominated by a conservative Islamic faction under Ayatollah Khomeini. Partly in reaction to the Shah&#8217;s policies, they were also strongly anti-Western and in particular anti-American.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Religious conservatives subsequently crushed Westernisation and also any liberal or left-wing influences. Iranian student protesters seized the US Embassy in Tehran on 4 November 1979 and held hostages for 444 days &#8211; until 20 January 1981. Noticing the upheaval in Iran, Saddam Hussein seized Iranian oil fields in the south of the country and from 1980 to 1988, Iran fought a bloody, indecisive war with Iraq and in the end, the borders were turned back to their pre-war locations.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Current Issues.<\/strong> Key current issues affecting the country include the pace of accepting outside modernising influences and reconciliation between clerical control of the regime and popular government participation and widespread demands for reform. Inflation and unemployment (particularly among youth) are major economic challenges. Relations between Iran and the rest of the world, particularly Western countries, have considerably improved with the 2015 nuclear agreement, which started a gradual lift of economical sanctions against the country. On the other hand, relations between Iran and Saudi Arabiahave drastically deteriorated: as of 2017, the two countries are on opposite sides in violent wars in Syria and Yemen. The United States pulled out of the nuclear agreement and proceeded to impose more punitive sanctions on Iran after a new president came to power in 2017, and relations between the two have deteriorated rapidly since then, with both countries often threatening to go to war with each other. This has certain consequences for visitors to both countries (see #Get_in). All Iranian presidents since 1979 as well as both &#8220;spiritual leaders&#8221;, Khomeini and Khamenei also have engaged in various degrees of anti-Israel rhetoric (often refusing even to use the word &#8220;Israel&#8221;), though there continues to exist an Iranian Jewish community that is even represented in parliament. Perhaps the case most noticed in the west was when President Ahmadinejad was translated (among other sources on his own English language website) as calling for Israel to be &#8220;wiped off the map&#8221; garnering notable controversy and allegations of mistranslation. However, as Ahmadinejad himself pointed out, he was only paraphrasing a statement often made by Khomeini and Khamenei in various forms which is nigh-consensus among the highest echelons of the Iranian political and religious elite.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>RELIGION<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The main divisions of Islam are Shi&#8217;a and Sunni. The split goes back to a time just after the Prophet&#8217;s death; would the movement be controlled by some of his leading followers (Sunni), or by his family, in particular by his son-in-law Ali (Shi&#8217;a)? (Shi&#8217;a comes from &#8220;shiat Ali&#8221;, i.e. the faction\/party of Ali) There was a long, complex and bloody struggle over this. Today, Iran is one of a few countries that are predominantly Shi&#8217;a, and the only one where Shi&#8217;a Islam is the official religion. The Iranian government supports the Shi&#8217;a Hezbollah movement among others, and is therefore accused by America of fomenting terrorism.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">One of the major events of Shi&#8217;a religious life is the Day of Ashura on the 10th of the month of Moharram; &#8220;ashura&#8221; means &#8220;10th&#8221;. It commemorates the death of Ali&#8217;s son Hussein at the Battle of Karbala in 61 AH (680 AD). This is not a joyful celebration, but a very sober day of atonement. travellers should not play music or act remarkably cheerful in public at this time.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Traditional activities include parades in which people do &#8216;matham&#8217; \u2014 chest-beating, self-flagellation, sometimes even hitting oneself with a sword \u2014 which is a way of remembering Imam Hussein who was martyred along with his half brother, cousins, friends, and two young sons. Dramatic re-enactments of the battle are also sometimes done.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">While Shi&#8217;a Islam is without a doubt the dominant religion in Iran, there are several religious minorities. Sunni Islam in Iran is mainly practiced by ethnic minorities such as the Arabs, Kurds, Balushis, and Turkmens. Non-Islamic faiths also exist in smaller numbers, the most notable being Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Judaism, all three of which are recognized as minority religions by the Iranian constitution, and guaranteed representation in parliament. Despite Iran being an Islamic republic, fire temples, churches, and synagogues continue to operate legally in the country. Most Iranian Christians follow Oriental Orthodoxy, and are of Armenian ethnicity. Iran also has the largest Jewish population in the Middle East outside Israel. While there are also a significant number of Baha&#8217;is in Iran, they are not recognized by the constitution and are instead branded as heretics of Islam, meaning that they continue to be persecuted to this day in spite of being Iran&#8217;s numerically largest non-Muslim religion. One unique practice among Iranian men and women is the encounter of wedleases (temporary marriages) which locally are known as mut&#8217;ah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>CLIMATE<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Iran has a diverse climate. In the northwest, winters are cold with heavy snowfall and subzero temperatures during December and January. Spring and fall are relatively mild, while summers are dry and hot. In the south, winters are mild and the summers are very hot, having average daily temperatures in July exceeding 38\u00b0 C (100\u00b0 F) and can hit 50\u00b0 C in parts of the desert. On the Khuzestan plain, summer heat is accompanied by high humidity.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In general, Iran has an arid climate in which most of the relatively scant annual precipitation falls from October to April. In most of the country, yearly precipitation averages 25 cm or less. The major exceptions are the higher mountain valleys of the Zagros and the Caspian coastal plain, where precipitation averages at least 50 cm annually. In the western part of the Caspian, rainfall exceeds 100 cm annually and is distributed relatively evenly throughout the year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>GEOGRAPHY<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rugged, mountainous rim; high, central basin with deserts, mountains; small, discontinuous plains along both coasts. The highest point is Mount Damavand (5,610 m).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Desert:<\/strong> two great deserts extend over much of central Iran: the Dasht-e Lut is covered largely with sand and rocks, and the Dasht-e Kavir is covered mainly with salt. Both deserts are inhospitable and virtually uninhabited.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Mountain:<\/strong> the Zagros range stretches from the border with the Republic of Armenia in the north-west to the Persian Gulf, and then eastward into Baluchistan. Zagros is extremely hard, difficult to access, and populated largely by pastoral nomads. The Alborz mountain range, narrower than the Zagros, runs along the southern shore of the Caspian to meet the border ranges of Khorasan to the east.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Forest:<\/strong> approximately 11% of Iran is forested, most extensively in the Caspian region, and is densely populated. Here one finds the broad-leafed, vigorous deciduous trees, usually oak, beech, linden, elm, walnut, ash, and hornbeam, as well as a few broad-leafed evergreens. Thorny shrubs and fern also abound. The narrow Caspian coastal plain, in contrast, is covered with rich brown forest soil.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>GET IN<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>VISA<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Visa restrictions:<br \/>\n<\/b>Entry will be refused to <b>citizens of Israel<\/b> and to foreign travellers with <i>any<\/i> evidence of having visited Israel \u2014 not just Israeli entry stamps, but also Egyptian and Jordanian stamps from border crossings with Israel \u2014 except that if you had an Israeli visa that expired more than a year before you apply for an Iranian visa, you may be allowed entry into Iran.

Turnaround times can be as short as a week, but the Interest Section in Washington does not reliably answer emails or phone calls.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The Iran tourist visa is issued for up to 30 days and is extendable. It must be obtained before travelling to Iran and valid to enter for 90 days from the issue date. Approved Iranian travel agents can apply and get visas for all foreign nationals (except Israeli passport holders).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">To apply and get your visa you must contact an approved Iranian travel agent, or go to an Iranian consulate. After receiving your personal data, they apply to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Your visa will then be authorised by the MFA and faxed to the Iranian consulate near you. Your travel agent gives you a visa authorisation number with which you can refer to the consulate to get your visa. The visa authorisation number, however, is valid only in the consulate you have asked them your visa to be issued in. The number they give you is just an &#8220;authorisation&#8221;. This reference number means that your visa has been authorised and approved by the MFA but is not the visa.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Depending on your nationality, you may be required to present at the Iranian consulate in your country to have your fingerprints taken. British and American passport holders will be fingerprinted upon arrival.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">After your travel agent tells you your visa authorisation number you should first get a visa application from the consulate and follow the requirements of the application form (you may either personally go to the consulate to get the application forms or, if the service available, download it from the web site of the Iranian embassy in your country). Then, you should refer to the consulate to lodge your passports and application forms with the visa number they gave you (it can be either a physical presence or by post). Then it might take from 1-5 days for the consulate to issue your visa.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">You may also need to provide a letter of recommendation from your embassy if you are applying outside your home country, a photocopy of your air tickets in and out of Iran and any student or press card.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Normally, all tourist visas issued by Iranian consulates have a &#8220;3-month&#8221; validity. The visa allows you to stay in Iran for up to 30 days, (sometimes you can get the tourist visa up to 90 days), although the duration of your visa is at the discretion of the MFA. (All tourist visas will be issued as a single entry, unless you request the approval from Tehran.) Tourist visas must be used within 14 days from issue, but the maximum duration of your stay is still 30 days.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rarely, you may be asked to provide a letter from your employer or proof of funds. Visas are generally valid for three months that is you must enter Iran within three months of issue.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Depending on your nationality, issuing a visa may take 30 days or more.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">There are reports that it is possible to get a visa in 10 days in Istanbul consulate, especially for German passport holders.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"mw-h2section\">\n<div class=\"mw-h3section\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Types of visa<\/b>: Entry, Transit, Business, Tourist and Journalist.

Some travel guides say not to do this in Tehran as it is very time consuming. This is no longer the case and the process of extending a visa in Tehran can be done in just 1 hour (including tea offerings and being the object of curiosity in the office). Extending a visa a second time requires the passport to be sent to a department in Tehran (no matter where you extend your visa from) and thus takes longer time than doing this the first time. The tourist visa can be extended once or twice at most, each time you can get 15 days more. The price of extending a visa is fixed rate 300,000 rial.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">To extend your visa in Tehran, the first or second time, you should go to the Passport and Immigration office situated on Parvin Street, at the crossing with 150 East Street and 123 Khovat Street, very close to Tehranpars metro station.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Places known to extend visas happily in Iran are Tehran, Mashhad, Tabriz, Esfahan, Shiraz, Kerman and Zahedan. The extension process is normally handled at provincial police headquarters.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Although it has become easier to get a tourist visa, whether the process takes one day or one month depends largely on your nationality and the staff of the embassy you are applying to. Your best bet is to apply to the Iranian embassy in your own country at least three months before your departure, but it is possible to obtain one while travelling in other countries, with varying degrees of difficulty.

Tourist visa on arrival can be extended by 15 more days. 3-month tourist visa on arrival are issued to Chinese tourists (including Hong Kong and Macau) as well. Citizens of the USA, UK, Canada, Somali, Bangladesh, Jordan, Afghanistan and Pakistan cannot obtain visa upon their arrival in airports, and they are required to have the visa stamped in their passport in advance. Instant visa is obtainable for tourists from the above-mentioned countries and it does not apply to those who hold official passports, businessmen or journalists. There is no restriction for foreign tourists to obtain a visa upon their arrival at Iranian airports several times within a year.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">To get the visa on arrival, be sure to have a legitimate <em>confirmed accommodation<\/em> for at least a night in Iran, e.g. hostel or hotel. Write down the hostel name, the address, and the phone number as the visa officer will call your accommodation. Entry could be denied if you just write down a random hostel or hotel as they won&#8217;t be able to confirm you to the visa officer. The visa generally costs \u20ac75 for most countries (Europeans and Thais). However, the visa cost differs from nation to nation, for example for Indonesians, it costs \u20ac45 and for Croatians \u20ac50. There is no need for passport photo, the visa is issued with a copy of the photo in your passport.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><em>Insurance<\/em> is mandatory and you will need to show proof of it to get the visa. Have a confirmation by your insurance ready that clearly states that it is still valid and that it covers Iran.

There are few places the very cheap buses don&#8217;t travel to, the train network is limited but comfortable and reasonably priced and travel by air is not expensive. The ticket prices are always fixed and you don&#8217;t have benefits of early bookings.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">However, train stations and bus terminals are often located on the outskirts of their cities. As an extreme example, Shiraz Station is located farther away from the city center than Shiraz International Airport. Since city transport is notably underdeveloped, the cost of an intercity trip could mostly consist of taxi fares.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">By Plane.\u00a0For anyone on a tight deadline, affordable domestic air services are a blessing. The major national carrier <em>Iran Air<\/em>, and its semi-private competitors such as <em>Iran Aseman Airlines <\/em>&#8211; Aseman meaning &#8220;sky&#8221; in Persian, <em>Mahan Air and Kish Air<\/em> link Tehran with most regional capitals and offer inter-regional flights for no more than US$60.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Their services are frequent, reliable and are definitely worth considering to skip the large distances within Iran. Planes are aging (although improved relations with Europe in recent decades has led to many orders and some deliveries of new planes), and maintenance and safety procedures are sometimes well below western standards, but it still remains the safest way to get around Iran, given the huge death toll on the roads.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Tickets can be bought at airports or travel agents dotted through the most major cities. Book early during the summer months of August and September since finding seats at short notice is virtually impossible.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">If you are from a &#8220;western&#8221; country, some agencies are reluctant to let you book a domestic flight.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>By Bus<\/strong>.\u00a0The Iranian domestic bus network is extensive and thanks to the low cost of fuel, very cheap. In fact the only drawback is speed: the government has limited buses to 80 km\/h to combat lead-footed bus drivers so long haul trips such as Shiraz to Mashhad can take up to 20 hours.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">There is little difference between the various bus companies, and most offer two classes: &#8216;lux&#8217; or &#8216;Mercedes&#8217; (2nd class) and &#8216;super&#8217; or &#8216;Volvo&#8217; (1st class). First class buses are air-conditioned and you will be provided with a small snack during your trip, while second class services are more frequent. Given the affordability of first class tickets (for example 70,000 rials from Esfehan to Shiraz), there&#8217;s little financial incentive to choose the second class services, especially in summer.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Buses start (and usually end) their journeys at sprawling bus stations, called &#8220;terminal&#8221; in Farsi. On important routes such as Tehran\u2013Esfahan they don&#8217;t stop along the route except at toll booths and rest areas. This probably shouldn&#8217;t discourage you from leaving a bus before its destination because most travellers would take a taxi from the terminal anywa<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Most cities operate comprehensive <b>local bus services<\/b>, but given the low cost of taxis and the difficulties of reading Persian-language signs (which, unlike road signs, do not have English counterparts) and route numbers, they are of little use to the casual travellers. If you&#8217;re cash strapped and brave enough to try, however, remember that the buses are segregated. Men enter via the front or rear door and hand their ticket to the driver before taking a seat in the front half of the bus. Women and children should hand their ticket to the driver via the front doors (without actually getting on) before entering via the rear door to take a seat at the back.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">By Train. Raja Passenger Trains is the passenger rail system. Travelling by train through Iran is generally more comfortable and faster than speed-limited buses. Sleeper berths in overnight trains are especially good value as they allow you to get a good night&#8217;s sleep while saving on a night&#8217;s accommodation.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The rail network is comprised of three main trunks. The first stretches east to west across the north of the country linking the Turkish and Turkmenistan borders via Tabriz, Tehran and Mashhad. The second and third extend south of Tehran but split at Qom. One line connects to the Persian Gulf via Ahvaz and Arak, while the other traverses the country&#8217;s centre linking Kashan, Yazd, Kerman and Bandar Abbas.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">There are high-speed trains from Tehran to Mashhad and Bandar Abbas called Pardis. Another high-speed line connecting Tehran, Imam Khomeini Airport, Qom and Esfahan is under construction as of 2016.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Known as a &#8220;ghatar&#8221; in Persian; trains are probably the cheapest, safest, most reliable and easiest way to travel around the country. As an added benefit; you&#8217;ll get to meet the people, sample food and see other tourists. You also avoid all the checkpoints you will encounter driving on the road. Trains are frequently delayed so leave plenty of time between destinations.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>By Taxi.\u00a0<\/strong>Low fuel costs have made <b>inter-city travel<\/b> by taxi a great value option in Iran. When travelling between cities up to 250 km apart, you may be able to hire one of the shared <i>sav\u0101ri<\/i> taxis that loiter around bus terminals and train stations. taxis are faster than buses and Taxis will only leave when four paying passengers have been found, so if you&#8217;re in a hurry you can offer to pay for an extra seat.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Official <b>shared local taxis<\/b> or <b>Savari<\/b>, also ply the major roads of most cities. The taxis are generally yellow, and on busy routs there are green vans with a capacity of 11 passengers. They offer a lower fare for each passenger. They usually run straight lines between major squares and landmarks, and their set rates between 2,000-10,000 rials are dictated by the local governments.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Hailing one of these taxis is an art you&#8217;ll soon master. Stand on the side of the road with traffic flowing in your intended direction and flag down a passing cab. It will slow down fractionally, giving you about one second to shout your destination&#8211;pick a major nearby landmark instead of the full address&#8211;through the open passenger window. If the driver is interested, he&#8217;ll slow down enough for you to negotiate the details or simply accepts your route.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">If you&#8217;re in a hurry, you can rent the taxi privately. Just shout the destination followed by the phrase <i>dar bast<\/i> (literally &#8216;closed door&#8217;) and the driver will almost be sure to stop. Negotiate the price before departure, but since you are paying for all the empty seats expect to pay four times the normal shared taxi fare.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">You can also rent these taxis by the hour to visit a number of sites, but you can expect to pay from 40,000-70,000 rials\/hr, depending on your bargaining skills. Most of the taxis have &#8220;taximeters&#8221; but only &#8216;closed door&#8217; green taxis use it.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">There are several popular ride hailing services available in the major cities similar to Uber. Snapp and Tap30 are the major applications which can be installed on iOS and Android devices for free. You can pay in cash or if you have an Iranian debit card, you may pay in the app as well.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>By Car.<\/strong> A large road network and low fuel costs (10,000 rials\/L for Iranians in Oct 2017) have historically made Iran an attractive country for exploring with your own car. However a government fuel tax on foreigners entering Iran by private car has somewhat dimmed the allure.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Foreigners arriving in Iran with their own car must have a Carnet de passage and a valid international drivers&#8217; license. Petrol stations can be found on the outskirts of all cities and towns and in car-filled Iran, a mechanic is never far away.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Do not underestimate the sheer chaos of Iran&#8217;s traffic. The often ignored road rules state that you must drive on the right unless overtaking and give way to traffic coming on to a roundabout. Drivers frequently top 160 km\/h (100 mph) on intercity highways. Laws requiring car occupants to wear seat belts for rear passengers are not always complied with. Motorcycles are sometimes seen transporting up to five people, without helmets.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Avoid large rocks in the middle of highway. These are often placed there in an attempt to burst your tires. Afterward, a passerby will offer to replace your tire for US$50. This is of course a scam that occurs mostly at nighttime but has diminished due to aggressive policing.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">You can also rent a car, usually for US$20-50 a day. Insurance and legal liability may make you think twice about renting a car, especially considering the fact that renting a car with a driver usually costs the same.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">People are not allowed to carry their pet even in their private car and will receive driving penalties if caught by the Police.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Iranian roads and major streets usually feature traffic enforcement cameras.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>LANGUAGE<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Persian<\/b> (called <i><b>f\u0101rsi<\/b><\/i> in Persian), an Indo-European language, is Iran&#8217;s national and official language. Although Persian is written with a modified Arabic alphabet, the two languages are not related; however, Persian does contain a very large number of Arabic loanwords (that may differ in meaning), many of which are part of basic Persian vocabulary (see section on &#8220;Iranian nationality&#8221; under &#8220;Respect&#8221; ).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Many young Iranians in major cities, and almost certainly those working at international travel agencies and high-end hotels will know conversational English, but for the tourist knowing basic Persian phrases will definitely be of use, particularly in rural areas.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Road signs are often double signed in English, but few other signs are. As an extra challenge, most Persian signage uses an ornate calligraphic script that bears little resemblance to its typed form. This can make comparing typed words in phrase books&#8211;such as &#8216;bank&#8217; and &#8216;hotel&#8217;&#8211;to signs on buildings quite difficult. However it is still worth memorising the Persian script for a few key words such as restaurant, guesthouse, and hotel (see relevant sections below for the script).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Being able to recognise Persian numerals is extremely helpful in situations where one needs to deal with directions (e.g. finding a bus at a bus station) and sums (e.g. understanding what is written on a restaurant bill).

Amassed by the former Shah and his wife who were avid and ostentatious collectors, the museums collection, conservatively valued at US$2.5 billion, is one of the most important modern and contemporary art collections in the world. It includes collections from Pablo Picasso, Wassily Kandinsky, Andy Warhol, Marcel Duchamp, Francis Bacon, David Hockney and Jackson Pollock among many others. Much of it remains un-catalogued, officially because it is so numerous but also because it is taboo. No western works have been on display for many years although in late 2013 staff expressed hope that the authorities may grant permission for specific pieces to be displayed as part of a tourist drive. In the meantime art lovers can sigh as they leaf through a reference copy of some of the collection, available for viewing at reception.

In this palace, Shah Abbas II and his successors would receive dignitaries and ambassadors, either on the terrace or in one of the stately reception halls.

The eastern parts consists mostly of desert basins such as the Dasht-e Kavir, Iran&#8217;s largest desert, in the north-central portion of the country, and the Dasht-e Lut, in the east, and some salt lakes. There is also the Central desert which as can be understood from its name is located in the central regions. This is because the mountain ranges are too high for rain clouds to reach these regions.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">There are a lot of activities that can be done in the desert areas including; desert tracking, camel riding, bicycle riding and 4&#215;4 driving excursions.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In some parts of the deserts there are some camping sites available.

They read traditional Persian poems or stories.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Ashura-Tasua<\/b> is the most interesting and amazing days for tourists. Shia Muslims believe that Hussein, their popular leader and the grandson of their prophet Muhammad, was killed in the year 61\u00a0AH along with his family and 72 Muslims in the so-called battle of Karbala. He fought a king that he believed did not follow the real Islamic values. For Shia Muslims this was a very sad event and a period of intense grief and mourning. Therefore, Iranians throughout the country wear black clothes during the grieving month of Muharram and hoist black flags everywhere. On Ashura people do public carnival-like &#8216;theater plays&#8217; in mosques (with horses, sometimes huge fires) in memorial of Husseins sacrifice. So far the city of Yazd is probably the best place to observe Ashura as a large group of volunteers organise several days of &#8216;spiritual tourism&#8217;: free shuttle buses bring tourists to the sides, catering and English speaking volunteers who explain everything &#8211; for free.

Coins are rarely if ever used. Banknotes are produced in 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, 50,000, and 100,000 denominations and banknotes called &#8220;Iran Cheques&#8221; are produced in 500,000 and 1,000,000 denominations.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Toman.<\/strong>\u00a0Confusion with the currency is standard for a visitor, not just because of the large numbers but because of the shorthand routinely used. Prices of goods may be verbally communicated or written in toman instead of in rial. One toman is equal to ten rials. There are no toman notes &#8211; prices are quoted as such just as a shortcut. If it is not obvious, be sure to clarify in which currency the price is quoted.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Debit Card and ATM.<\/strong> ATMs and merchants in Iran generally do not accept foreign (non-Iranian) cards due to the sanctions, so bring all the money you might need in cash, preferably in US dollars or euros. Debit cards and credit cards issued by an Iranian bank are widely accepted in most places, and most of stores and ticket offices have a point-of-sale machine, without any commission. If you don&#8217;t want to carry a lot of cash, and feel panic about so many zeros in the prices, you can apply for a tourism debit card. Iranian banks cannot issue a debit card or tourism debit card to a foreign without a resident card. You should choose a tourism card company which cooperates with a bank to get a debit card.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Daripay: You can receive your card at Imam Khomeini International Airport or any hotels in Tehran. You can convert your euros or dollars in some large cities of Iran, they will send a clerk to you hotel for that.

The currency rate is based on the average price of black market which is much better than the official rate.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Another way to prevent having your money stolen is going to the nearest bank and getting a gift card (Kart-e Hadiyeh \u06a9\u0627\u0631\u062a \u0647\u062f\u06cc\u0647). They are exactly like ordinary ATM debit cards, but once they get empty, they cannot be recharged. The two first ways are more recommended. A list of permitted Iranian banks can be found here. Most of banks now don&#8217;t sell the gift card, although there is such restriction as for debit cards that requires a resident card for foreigners to buy gift cards.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Exchanging Money.<\/strong> Bills in good condition and large bills (US$100 or \u20ac100) tend to be preferred at currency exchange offices. Small denominations can be useful for small purchases before you get to an exchange office, although many exchange shops will not exchange small bills. On arrival at Tehran International Airport, the maximum amount that may be exchanged at night is to \u20ac50 per person.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The best places to exchange money are the private exchange offices (<i>sar\u0101fi<\/i>) scattered around most large cities and major tourist centres. Their rates are usually 20% better than the official rate offered by the banks, they are far quicker and don&#8217;t require any paperwork, and unlike their black market colleagues, they can be traced later on if something goes wrong. Exchange offices can be found in major cities, their opening times are usually Sunday to Thursday from 08:00 to 16:00. Most are closed on Fridays and on holidays. There is little point in risking the use of black market moneychangers who loiter outside of major banks and only offer marginally better rates than the banks.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The most widely-accepted currencies are US dollar and euros. Other major currencies such as the British pound, Australian or Canadian dollars and Japanese yen are accepted at a lot of money changers. Non-major currencies usually cannot be exchanged. US$100 and large euro unfolded notes tend to attract the best exchange rate, and you may be quoted lower rates or turned down for any old or ripped notes or small denomination notes.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Foreign <b>credit cards<\/b> are only accepted by select stores with foreign bank accounts such as Persian rugs stores but they will almost always charge an additional fee for paying by credit card rather than with cash. Most of these stores will be happy to forward you some cash on your credit card at the same time as your purchase. If you are desperate for cash, you can also try asking these shops to extend you the same favour without buying a rug or souvenir, but expect to pay a fee of around 10%.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Travellers&#8217; cheques<\/b>: Cashing travellers&#8217; cheques can be hit-or-miss and it is advised not to rely on travellers&#8217; cheques issued by American or European companies.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Prepaid<\/b> debit cards can be bought at Iranian banks and serve as a good alternative to carrying a large wad of cash around the country.

The ATM network in Iran is subject to outages so make sure that you withdraw the entire balance well before you leave the country.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Large Iranian banks, like Bank-e Melli-ye Iran (BMI, National Bank of Iran), Bank -e- Sepah, Bank Mellat, Bank-e Saaderaat-e Iran (BSI), Bank-e Paasaargad and Bank-e Saamaan (Saamaan Bank), and Beank-e Paarsiaan all have branches outside the country that can be found at their websites. You can open a bank account abroad before arrival. This might be possible even in some European countries. You can find the addresses of these banks&#8217; websites using famous search engines; then you need to click the link to the English section of their sites which is usually shown using the word <i>English<\/i> or the abbreviation <i>En<\/i>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Bazaars and Bargaining.<\/strong> While the shops offer a wide selection of quality goods, local items can be bought in the many bazaars. Purchases include hand-carved, inlaid woodwork, painted and molded copper, carpets, rugs, silks, leather goods, mats, tablecloths, gold, silver, glass, and ceramics. There are restrictions on which items may be taken out of the country and many countries restrict the amount of goods you can bring in due to sanctions.\u00a0<b>Bargain<\/b> ruthlessly when buying handcrafts, rugs or big ticket items and modestly when hailing private taxis. In most other aspects of life prices are fixed.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Tipping.<\/strong>\u00a0Tipping is generally not expected, but locals will generally round up the bill in taxis and add around 10% in restaurants. Porters and bellboys will expect 5,000 rials. A discreet gift of a few thousand <i>tom\u0101ns<\/i> may help grease the wheels of Iranian society and serve to thank an extraordinarily helpful local.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Foreign Surcharges<\/strong>.\u00a0You won&#8217;t be able to escape the government-sanctioned dual pricing system that applies to accommodation and some tourist attractions in Iran; foreigners often pay up to five times the price quoted to locals.

Lunch can be served from 12:00-15:00. and dinner is often eaten after 20:00. These and other social occasions in Iran are often long, drawn-out affairs conducted in a relatively relaxed tempo, often involving pastries, fruit and possibly nuts. As it is considered rude to refuse what is served, visitors should accept the items offered, even if they do not intend to consume them<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The importation and consumption of <b>alcohol<\/b> is strictly banned throughout the majority of Iran, but is tolerated in a few rural and poorly regulated areas. Penalties are severe. Registered religious minorities, however, are allowed to manufacture and consume small quantities of alcohol, but not to sell, export or import it. <b>Pork<\/b> and pork products are forbidden and, like alcohol, their import is illegal, though in practice shops serving the Christian community are allowed to sell pork with no major issues.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The good news for travellers is that Iranian cuisine is superb. A wide range of influences from Central Asia, the Caucasus, Russia, Europe and the Middle East have created a diverse, relatively healthy range of dishes that focus on fresh produce and aromatic herbs. The bad news, however, is that Iranians prefer to eat at home, rather than in restaurants, so decent eateries are scarce and stick to a repetitive selection of dishes (mainly kebabs). An invitation to an Iranian home for dinner will be a definite highlight of your stay. When visiting an Iranian household for the first time or on a special occasion it is customary for Iranians to bring a small gift. Flowers, sweets or pastries are popular gift choices.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Traditional Cuisine<br \/>\n<\/strong>Iranian cuisine is related to the cuisines of neighbouring Middle Eastern and South Asian countries but is in important ways highly distinctive.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Fragrant <b>rice<\/b> (\u0628\u0631\u0646\u062c, <i>berenj<\/i>) is the staple of Iranian food. Boiled and then steamed, it is often coloured with saffron or flavoured with a variety of spices. When served plain as an accompaniment it is known as <i>chelo<\/i> (\u0686\u0644\u0648).

Keep your wits about you, and take the usual precautions against pickpockets in crowded bazaars and buses.<br \/>\nIranian <b>traffic<\/b> is congested and chaotic. Guidelines are lax and rarely followed. Pedestrians are advised to exercise caution when crossing the roads, and even greater care when driving on them &#8211; Iranian drivers tend to overtake along pavements and any section of the road where there is space. In general, it is not recommended for inexperienced foreigners to drive in Iran. Watch out for <i><b>joobs<\/b><\/i> (\u062c\u0648\u0628), the open storm water drains that shoulder every road and are easy to miss when walking in the dark.<br \/>\nTravellers should avoid the <b>southeastern<\/b> area of Iran, particularly the province of Sistan va Baluchistan. The drug trade thrives based on smuggling heroin from Afghanistan. There is plenty of associated robbery, kidnapping and murder. Some cities, such as Zahedan, Zabol and Mirjaveh are particularly dangerous, although not every place in this region is dangerous. Chahbahar, which is close to the Pakistani border, is a very calm and friendly city.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><span id=\"Iranian_perceptions_of_outsiders\" class=\"mw-headline\">Iranian perceptions of outsiders.\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>Even though travellers may arrive with the image of a throng chanting &#8220;Death to America&#8221;, the chances of Westerners facing anti-Western sentiment as a traveller are slim. Even hardline Iranians make a clear distinction between the Western governments they distrust and individual travellers who visit their country. Americans may receive the odd jibe about their government&#8217;s policies, but usually nothing more serious than that. However, it is always best to err on the side of caution and avoid politically-oriented conversations, particularly in taxi cabs. In addition, a few Iranian-Americans have been detained and accused of espionage, as were three American hikers in 2009 who allegedly strayed across into Iran from Iraqi Kurdistan. These kind of incidents are rare, but still the broader implications are worth considering and bearing in mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-h2section\">\n<div class=\"mw-h3section\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Photography.<\/strong>\u00a0There are a lot of military and other sensitive facilities in Iran. Photography near military and other government installations is strictly prohibited. Any transgression may result in detention and serious criminal charges, including espionage, which can carry the death penalty. Do not photograph any military object, jails, harbours, or telecommunication devices, airports or other objects and facilities which you suspect are military in nature. Be aware that this rule is taken very seriously in Iran.<br \/>\n<strong>Women.<\/strong>\u00a0Female travellers should not encounter any major problems when visiting Iran, but will undoubtedly be the subject of at least some unwanted attention but they should obey local laws. Contrary to popular belief, Iranian women typically differ little from those in the West, although differences may be more prominent in highly religious families. In Tehran and several bigger cities Western clothing and formality is accepted but wearing a hijab may be required in most of rural areas. Women by law must wear a headscarf in public.<br \/>\n<strong>Gay and Lesbian Travellers.\u00a0<\/strong>Iran is one of the most anti-gay countries in the world: male homosexuality is punishable by death and sex by lesbians is punishable with lashes. These two punishments, in Iran&#8217;s judiciary system, are only administered if an act of gay or lesbian sex is proved by means of 4 or more witnesses (although the definition of a witness can be surprisingly broad).<br \/>\nGay or lesbian couples who travel in Iran should exercise full discretion. Public displays of affection between male or female couples, such as holding hands, arms draped over shoulders and kissing on the cheek might result in harassment by security forces.<br \/>\n<strong>Transgender People.<\/strong>\u00a0Although Iran has very tough legislation against homosexuals, the country is friendly to transgender people and those who are going to change their gender. Iran is the 2nd country in the world by transgender population and medical services are widely available. Also, after official gender changing process you can grant cheap loans for the business or any other purposes, which can be helpful for socialization.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>RESPECT<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In general, Iranians are warm, friendly and generous individuals with a strong interest in foreigners and other cultures. In dealing with Iranians, the following tips relating to customs and etiquette may prove useful:<br \/>\nAlthough its strict Islamic moral code is well known, Iranian laws are not as strict as those of Saudi Arabia. Respecting the dozens of unspoken rules and regulations of Iranian life can be a daunting prospect for travellers, but don&#8217;t be intimidated. As a foreigner you will be given leeway and it doesn&#8217;t take long to acclimatise yourself.<br \/>\nThe culture, like most others in the Middle East and Central Asia, has a strong tradition of hospitality. Guests are often treated extremely well. On the other hand, there is some insularity; any foreigner may be regarded with suspicion. In Persian for Mr, Ms they say \u201cAghaye [name], Khanoome [name]\u201d and out of respect they use plural verbs and pronouns. They often greet by raising hand to shake or\/and give a hug which is a common Middle Eastern tradition. And they will tell you: Kheili Khosh Amadid. (Welcome! for greeting.) But if you are a man, do not attempt to shake hands with a woman unless she voluntarily raises her hand. When you greet someone sitting, s\/he will stand up.<br \/>\n<strong>Iranian Nationality.<\/strong>\u00a0Most Iranian citizens are not Arabs and their primary language is Persian (natively known as \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc Farsi or \u067e\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc Parsi). Referring to them as &#8220;Arabs&#8221; in general conversation may irritate them. Iranians are very proud of their history, nationality and country and are highly sensitive to this.<br \/>\nIran has over 4,000 years of written history and organised civilisation; see Persian Empire. It was conquered three times: by the Greeks under Alexander in the 4th century BCE, the Arabs in the 8th CE, and the Mongols in the 13th. &#8220;Persia&#8221; is a name of Greek origin attributed to Iran. &#8220;Persian&#8221; cannot be equated with &#8220;Iranian,&#8221; as Iran has several ethnic groups, including Persian, Azeri, Kurd, Arab, Baluchi and Mazandarani. After the Arab conquest, Persian alphabet was changed to an Arabic-based one. Indeed the word &#8220;Farsi&#8221; itself is an Arabic articulation of the word &#8220;Parsi&#8221;, the original word meaning &#8220;Persian&#8221;. Today, the Persian language has many <i>loan words<\/i> taken from the Arabic language. The Arabic language has also adopted some words from Persian. There are several widely-spoken Iranian languages, Kurdish, Persian, and Balochi are all Western Iranian languages, while Pashto is an Eastern Iranian language. Persian is the official language of 3 nations &#8211; Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan &#8211; and is spoken within 13 nations of the region and in general by the Iranian diaspora elsewhere.<br \/>\nOver the 19th and 20th centuries Iran was frequently subjected to unfavorable political interference by the Russian Empire and its successor, the USSR. The British and then the USA also sought to influence and control the politics, resources and destiny of Iran. In 1980, Iraq under Saddam Hussein, supported by most of the global community, attacked and invaded Iran, causing the country to suffer a bloody 8-year war that drastically undermined its infrastructure and consumed its resources.<br \/>\nGiven the above, the Iranian people feel that history has frequently not been on their side and that the global community owes them respect and sensitivity.<br \/>\n<strong>Dress<br \/>\n<\/strong>Perhaps the most visible mark of Iran&#8217;s Islamic leanings is the conservative dress expected of its citizens. Although normal Western-style clothing is acceptable in private homes, when in public <b>women<\/b> are required to cover everything but their face, hands and feet.<br \/>\nThe most common uniform consists of a <b>head scarf<\/b> (<i>roo-sari<\/i>, \u0631\u0648\u0633\u0631\u06cc) to conceal the head and neck, a formless, knee-length coat known as a <i>manteau<\/i> (\u0645\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0648) and a <b>long dress<\/b> or pair of pants. In holy sites, you will be expected to dress even more modestly in a <i>ch\u0101dor<\/i>, a full-length swathe of black cloth designed to cloak everything but your face from view.<br \/>\nAs a foreigner, a female traveller is officially expected to cover her hair and body excluding hands and feet. Usually more tolerance tends to be shown towards foreigners over the detail of the dress code than is the case for Iranian women. However, this does not include leaving one\u2019s hair fully uncovered under any circumstance. &#8220;Acceptable&#8221; outfits may include a long, loose dress or shirt worn over loose skirt or pants and a scarf in the summer, and a full-length woolen coat and scarf in the winter (calf-length is acceptable if worn over pants). All colours and modest designs are acceptable. Even when undertaking sporting activity in public (such as tennis or jogging), the dress code described above must be maintained.<br \/>\n<b>Men<\/b> are also required to abide by the following dress code: Short-sleeved shirts and t-shirts are acceptable for daily wear. <b>Shorts<\/b> and three-quarter length pants are only acceptable on the beach. Dress attire for men is similar to that in Europe. Neckties are better to be avoided if visiting one of the more conservative government bodies. Regarded by the authorities as a sign of Imperialism and a reminder of the pro-western kingdom era, wearing neckties by the authorities and office workers of state-run companies is forbidden. It is quite acceptable in the areas outside though it denotes indifference toward or opposition against state regulations and values. Jogging in tracksuits (but not shorts) is acceptable for men.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-h2section\">\n<div class=\"mw-h3section\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><span id=\"Conduct\" class=\"mw-headline\">Conduct<br \/>\n<\/span><\/strong><b>Greet people<\/b> of the same sex with a handshake, three kisses or both, but avoid physical contact with people of the opposite sex in public. Wait for them to introduce themselves instead; or just introduce yourself normally. (Bowing with a hand over your heart may be seen occasionally.) In private, only shake hands with a member of the opposite sex when he\/she holds out his\/her hand first.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Be careful of initiating <b>political discussions<\/b>. The relative political freedom of ex-President Mohammad Khatami&#8217;s era is fading quickly and vocal opposition can be more trouble than it&#8217;s worth, even if your Iranian companions get engaged in it. It&#8217;s best not to discuss topics such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or the role of Islam in society regardless of what opinion you hold.<br \/>\n<strong>TAROF<\/strong>.\u00a0<i>Tarof<\/i> \u00a0is a genuine Persian form of civility emphasising both self-deference and social rank. The term encompasses a range of social behaviours, from a man displaying etiquette by opening the door for another person, to a group of colleagues standing on ceremony in front of a door that can permit the entry of only one at time, earnestly <i>imploring<\/i> the most senior to break the deadlock.<br \/>\nThe prevalence of <i>tarof<\/i> often gives rise to different styles of negotiation than one would see in a European or North American culture. For example, a worker negotiating a salary might begin with a eulogy of the employer, followed by a lengthy bargaining session consisting entirely of indirect, polite language &#8212; both parties are expected to understand the implied topic of discussion. It is quite common for an Iranian worker (even one employed in an Iranian neighbourhood within Europe) to work unpaid for a week or two before the issue of wages is finally broached. Likewise, a shopkeeper may initially refuse to quote a price for an item, suggesting that it is worthless. <i>Tarof<\/i> obliges the customer to insist on paying, possibly several times, before a shopkeeper finally quotes a price and real negotiation can begin.<br \/>\n<i>Tarof<\/i> also governs the rules of hospitality: a host is obliged to offer anything a guest might want, and a guest is equally obliged to refuse it. This ritual may repeat itself several times before the host and guest finally determine whether the host&#8217;s offer and the guest&#8217;s refusal are real or simply polite. It is possible to ask someone not to <i>tarof<\/i> (<i>tarof n\u00e4konid<\/i>), but that raises new difficulties, since the request itself might be a devious type of <i>tarof<\/i>. The best approach to handle Tarof is to be politely direct. Accept or reject as soon as you wish to, and be sure that Iranians will not be offended. Even though Tarof is <i>purely<\/i> about the art of civility, your engagement in Tarof might enter you into a vicious cycle of hypocrisy that may ruin your entire stay. The exception to this may be with food; as mentioned above, guests are expected to accept food they are offered at dinner, regardless of whether they intend to eat it.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Visiting Holy Sites<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Although no trip to Iran would be complete without a glimpse at the stunning architecture and sombre environments of its mosques or holy shrines, many travellers are daunted by the prospect of walking into the foreign world of a mosque. Don&#8217;t let these fears stop you; Iranians are welcoming and will understand any unintended breach of protocol.<br \/>\nSome mosques, and most holy shrines, require women to be wearing a <i>ch\u0101dor<\/i> before entering the complex. If you don&#8217;t have one, there are sometimes kiosks by the door that lend or hire <i>ch\u0101dors<\/i>. It is better for men to wear long-sleeved shirts inside a mosque or shrine, though this is not mandatory.<br \/>\nShoes are not worn within prayer areas of a mosque or shrine. Busier mosques have free shoe repositories where you trade your shoes for a token. Also try to avoid mosques on the holy day of Friday as they will be much busier and don&#8217;t photograph a mosque while prayers are taking place.<br \/>\nHoly shrines, like those in Mashad and Qom, are usually off limits to non-Muslims, although the surrounding complexes are fine.

Like in Japan, if you are an obvious occidental you are likely to make rapid and friendly progress.

Muslims fast every day for its duration and most restaurants will be closed until the fast breaks at dusk. Nothing (including water and cigarettes) is supposed to pass through the lips from dawn to sunset. Non-Muslims are exempt from this, but should still refrain from eating or drinking in public as this is considered very impolite. Working hours are decreased as well in the corporate world. Exact dates of Ramadan depend on local astronomical observations and may vary somewhat from country to country. Ramadan concludes with the festival of <i>Eid al-Fitr<\/i>, which may last several days, usually three in most countries.<br \/>\nContrary to popular belief, public observance of other religions, except the Baha&#8217;i faith and Ahmadiyyah, is officially tolerated in Iran. There is a sizable Christian community, most of whom are ethnic Armenians or Assyrians\/Chaldean, and a small Jewish community (which is nevertheless, the largest Jewish community in the Middle East outside Israel). In addition to the Abrahamic faiths, there are also significant numbers of Zoroastrians who are basically free to practise their own religion.<br \/>\nHowever, this is a fundamentalist Muslim country: do not do or say anything which can be perceived as an insult to Islam.

With 82 million inhabitants, Iran is the world&#8217;s 18th most populous country. Its territory spans 1,648,195\u00a0km2 (636,372\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), making it the second largest country in the Middle East and the 17th largest in the world. Iran is bordered to the northwest by Armenia and the Republic of Azerbaijan, to the north by the Caspian Sea, to the northeast by Turkmenistan, to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan, to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, and to the west by Turkey and Iraq. Its central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, give it geostrategic importance. Tehran is the political and economic center of Iran, and the largest and most populous city in Western Asia with more than 8.8 million residents in the city and 15 million in the larger metropolitan area.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Iran is home to one of the world&#8217;s oldest civilizations, beginning with the formation of the Elamite kingdoms in the fourth millennium BCE. It was first unified by the Iranian Medes in the seventh century BCE, and reached its territorial height in the sixth century BCE under Cyrus the Great, whose Achaemenid Empire stretched from Eastern Europe to the Indus Valley, one of the largest empires in history. The empire fell to Alexander the Great in the fourth century BCE and was divided into several Hellenistic states. An Iranian rebellion established the Parthian Empire in the third century BCE, which was succeeded in the third century CE by the Sasanian Empire, a leading world power for the next four centuries.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Arab Muslims conquered the empire in the seventh century CE, and the subsequent Islamization of Iran led to the decline of the once dominant Zoroastrian religion. Iran&#8217;s major contributions to art, philosophy, and science spread throughout the Muslim world and beyond during the Islamic Golden Age. Over the next two centuries, a series of native Muslim dynasties emerged before the Seljuq Turks and the Ilkhanate Mongols conquered the region. The rise of the native Safavids in the 15th century led to the reestablishment of a unified Iranian state and national identity, with the country&#8217;s conversion to Shia Islam marking a turning point in Iranian and Muslim history.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Under Nader Shah, Iran was one of the most powerful states in the 18th century, though by the 19th century, a series of conflicts with the Russian Empire led to significant territorial losses. The Persian Constitutional Revolution in the early 20th century created a constitutional monarchy and the country&#8217;s first legislature. A 1953 coup instigated by the United Kingdom and the United States resulted in greater autocratic rule under Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and growing Western political influence. A far-reaching series of reforms known as the White Revolution was launched by the Shah in 1963, prompting industrial growth, land reforms, and increased women&#8217;s rights. Nevertheless, widespread dissatisfaction and unrest against the monarchy persisted, leading to the Iranian Revolution, which established the current Islamic Republic. For most of the 1980s, Iran fought a war with Iraq that resulted in severe casualties and economic devastation for both sides.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Iran&#8217;s political system has elements of a presidential democracy with a theocracy governed by an autocratic &#8220;Supreme Leader&#8221;. It has been described as authoritarian, with significant constraints and abuses against human rights.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Iran is a founding member of the UN, ECO, NAM, OIC, and OPEC. It is a major regional and middle power, and its large reserves of fossil fuels\u2014including the world&#8217;s largest natural gas supply and the fourth largest proven oil reserves &#8211; exert considerable influence in international energy security and the world economy. The country&#8217;s rich cultural legacy is reflected in part by its 22 UNESCO World Heritage sites, the third largest number in Asia and 11th largest in the world. Historically a multi-ethnic country, Iran remains a pluralistic society comprising numerous ethnic, linguistic, and religious groups, the largest being Persians, Azeris, Kurds, Mazandaranis and Lurs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>NAME OF IRAN<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The term Iran derives directly from Middle Persian \u0112r\u0101n, first attested in a third-century inscription at Rustam Relief, with the accompanying Parthian inscription using the term Ary\u0101n, in reference to the Iranians. According to the Iranian mythology, the country&#8217;s name comes from name of Iraj, a legendary prince and briefly shah, who was killed by his brothers.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Historically, Iran has been referred to as Persia by the West, due mainly to the writings of Greek historians who referred to all of Iran as Pers\u00eds meaning &#8220;land of the Persians&#8221;, while Persis itself was one of the provinces of ancient Iran that is today defined as Fars. As the most extensive interaction the Ancient Greeks had with any outsider was with the Persians, the term persisted, even long after the Greco-Persian Wars (499\u2013449 BC).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In 1935, Reza Shah requested the international community to refer to the country by its native name, Iran, effective March 22 that year. Opposition to the name change led to the reversal of the decision in 1959, and Professor Ehsan Yarshater, editor of Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica, propagated a move to use Persia and Iran interchangeably. Today, both Iran and Persia are used in cultural contexts, while Iran remains irreplaceable in official state contexts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>HISTORY<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Prehistory. <\/strong>The earliest attested archaeological artifacts in Iran, like those excavated at Kashafrud and Ganj Par in northern Iran, confirm a human presence in Iran since the Lower Paleolithic. Iran&#8217;s Neanderthal artifacts from the Middle Paleolithic have been found mainly in the Zagros region, at sites such as Warwasi and Yafteh. From the 10th to the seventh millennium BC, early agricultural communities began to flourish in and around the Zagros region in western Iran, including Chogha Golan, Chogha Bonut, and Chogha Mish.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The emergence of Susa as a city, as determined by radiocarbon dating, dates back to early 4,395\u00a0BC. There are dozens of prehistoric sites across the Iranian Plateau, pointing to the existence of ancient cultures and urban settlements in the fourth millennium BC. During the Bronze Age, the territory of present-day Iran was home to several civilizations, including Elam, Jiroft, and Zayanderud. Elam, the most prominent of these civilizations, developed in the southwest alongside those in Mesopotamia, and continued its existence until the emergence of the Iranian empires. The advent of writing in Elam was paralleled to Sumer, and the Elamite cuneiform was developed since the third millennium BC.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">From the 34th to the 20th century BC, northwestern Iran was part of the Kura-Araxes culture, which stretched into the neighboring Caucasus and Anatolia. Since the earliest second millennium BC, Assyrians settled in swaths of western Iran and incorporated the region into their territories.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Classical antiquity <\/strong>(Median Empire, Achaemenid Empire, Seleucid Empire, Parthian Empire, and Sasanian Empire)By the second millennium BC, the ancient Iranian peoples arrived in what is now Iran from the Eurasian Steppe, rivaling the native settlers of the region. As the Iranians dispersed into the wider area of Greater Iran and beyond, the boundaries of modern-day Iran were dominated by Median, Persian, and Parthian tribes.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">From the late 10th to the late seventh century BC, the Iranian peoples, together with the &#8220;pre-Iranian&#8221; kingdoms, fell under the domination of the Assyrian Empire, based in northern Mesopotamia. Under king Cyaxares, the Medes and Persians entered into an alliance with Babylonian ruler Nabopolassar, as well as the fellow Iranian Scythians and Cimmerians, and together they attacked the Assyrian Empire. The civil war ravaged the Assyrian Empire between 616 and 605\u00a0BC, thus freeing their respective peoples from three centuries of Assyrian rule. The unification of the Median tribes under king Deioces in 728\u00a0BC led to the foundation of the Median Empire which, by 612\u00a0BC, controlled almost the entire territory of present-day Iran and eastern Anatolia. This marked the end of the Kingdom of Urartu as well, which was subsequently conquered and dissolved.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In 550\u00a0BC, Cyrus the Great, the son of Mandane and Cambyses I, took over the Median Empire, and founded the Achaemenid Empire by unifying other city-states. Later conquests under Cyrus and his successors expanded the empire to include Lydia, Babylon, Egypt, parts of the Balkans and Eastern Europe proper, as well as the lands to the west of the Indus and Oxus rivers.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">539 BC was the year in which Persian forces defeated the Babylonian army at Opis, and marked the end of around four centuries of Mesopotamian domination of the region by conquering the Neo-Babylonian Empire. Cyrus entered Babylon and presented himself as a traditional Mesopotamian monarch. Subsequent Achaemenid art and iconography reflect the influence of the new political reality in Mesopotamia.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">At its greatest extent, the Achaemenid Empire included territories of modern-day Iran, Republic of Azerbaijan (Arran and Shirvan), Armenia, Georgia, Turkey (Anatolia), much of the Black Sea coastal regions, northeastern Greece and southern Bulgaria (Thrace), northern Greece and North Macedonia (Paeonia and Macedon), Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian territories, all significant population centers of ancient Egypt as far west as Libya, Kuwait, northern Saudi Arabia, parts of the United Arab Emirates and Oman, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and much of Central Asia, making it the first world government and the largest empire the world had yet seen.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">It is estimated that in 480 BC, 50 million people lived in the Achaemenid Empire. The empire at its peak ruled over 44% of the world&#8217;s population, the highest such figure for any empire in history<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The Achaemenid Empire is noted for the release of the Jewish exiles in Babylon, building infrastructures such as the Royal Road and the Chapar (postal service), and the use of an official language, Imperial Aramaic, throughout its territories. The empire had a centralized, bureaucratic administration under the emperor, a large professional army, and civil services, inspiring similar developments in later empires.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Eventual conflict on the western borders began with the Ionian Revolt, which erupted into the Greco-Persian Wars and continued through the first half of the fifth century BC, and ended with the withdrawal of the Achaemenids from all of the territories in the Balkans and Eastern Europe proper.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In 334\u00a0BC, Alexander the Great invaded the Achaemenid Empire, defeating the last Achaemenid emperor, Darius III, at the Battle of Issus. Following the premature death of Alexander, Iran came under the control of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire. In the middle of the second century BC, the Parthian Empire rose to become the main power in Iran, and the century-long geopolitical arch-rivalry between the Romans and the Parthians began, culminating in the Roman\u2013Parthian Wars. The Parthian Empire continued as a feudal monarchy for nearly five centuries, until 224\u00a0CE, when it was succeeded by the Sasanian Empire. Together with their neighboring arch-rival, the Roman-Byzantines, they made up the world&#8217;s two most dominant powers at the time, for over four centuries.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The Sasanians established an empire within the frontiers achieved by the Achaemenids, with their capital at Ctesiphon. Late antiquity is considered one of Iran&#8217;s most influential periods, as under the Sasanians their influence reached the culture of ancient Rome (and through that as far as Western Europe), Africa, China, and India, and played a prominent role in the formation of the medieval art of both Europe and Asia<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Most of the era of the Sasanian Empire was overshadowed by the Roman\u2013Persian Wars, which raged on the western borders at Anatolia, the Western Caucasus, Mesopotamia, and the Levant, for over 700 years. These wars ultimately exhausted both the Romans and the Sasanians and led to the defeat of both by the Muslim invasion.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Throughout the Achaemenid, Parthian, and Sasanian eras, several offshoots of the Iranian dynasties established eponymous branches in Anatolia and the Caucasus, including the Pontic Kingdom, the Mihranids, and the Arsacid dynasties of Armenia, Iberia (Georgia), and Caucasian Albania (present-day Republic of Azerbaijan and southern Dagestan).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Medieval period <\/strong>(Muslim conquest of Persia and Medieval Iran).\u00a0The prolonged Byzantine\u2013Sasanian wars, most importantly the climactic war of 602\u2013628, as well as the social conflict within the Sasanian Empire, opened the way for an Arab invasion of Iran in the seventh century. The empire was initially defeated by the Rashidun Caliphate, which was succeeded by the Umayyad Caliphate, followed by the Abbasid Caliphate. A prolonged and gradual process of state-imposed Islamization followed, which targeted Iran&#8217;s then Zoroastrian majority and included religious persecution, demolition of libraries and fire temples, a special tax penalty (&#8220;jizya&#8221;), and language shift.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In 750, the Abbasids overthrew the Umayyads, notably by the support from the &#8220;mawali&#8221; (converted Iranians). The mawali formed the majority of the rebel army, which was led by converted Iranian general Abu Muslim. The arrival of the Abbasid Caliphs saw a relative revival of Iranian culture and influence, as the role of the old Arab aristocracy was partially replaced by a Muslim Iranian bureaucracy.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">After two centuries of Arab rule, semi-independent and independent Iranian kingdoms\u2014including the Tahirids, Saffarids, Samanids, and Buyids\u2014began to appear on the fringes of the declining Abbasid Caliphate. By the Samanid era in the ninth and 10th centuries, the efforts of Iranians to regain their independence had been well solidified.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The blossoming literature, philosophy, mathematics, medicine, astronomy and art of Iran became major elements in the formation of a new age for the Iranian civilization, during a period known as the Islamic Golden Age. The Islamic Golden Age reached its peak by the 10th and 11th centuries, during which Iran was the main theater of scientific activities. After the 10th century, Persian, alongside Arabic, was used for scientific, medical, philosophical, arithmetical, historical, and musical works, and renowned Iranian writers\u2014such as Tusi, Avicenna, Qotb-od-Din Shirazi, and Biruni\u2014had major contributions in scientific writing. Among Iran&#8217;s famous medieval scientists, Al-Khwarizmi (whose name was Latinized as Algoritmi) gave a significant role in the development of the Arabic numerals and algebra through his 9th-century work On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals that is globally adopted as the modern numerical system.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The cultural revival that began in the Abbasid period led to a resurfacing of the Iranian national identity; thus, the attempts of Arabization never succeeded in Iran. The Shu&#8217;ubiyya movement became a catalyst for Iranians to regain independence in their relations with the Arab invaders. The most notable effect of this movement was the continuation of the Persian language attested to the works of the epic poet Ferdowsi, now considered the most prominent figure in Iranian literature.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The 10th century saw a mass migration of Turkic tribes from Central Asia into the Iranian Plateau. Turkic tribesmen were first used in the Abbasid army as mamluks (slave-warriors), replacing Iranian and Arab elements within the army. As a result, the Mamluks gained a significant political power. In 999, large portions of Iran came briefly under the rule of the Ghaznavids, whose rulers were of mamluk Turkic origin, and longer subsequently under the Seljuk and Khwarezmian empires. These dynasties had been Persianized, and had adopted Persian models of administration and rulership. The Seljuks subsequently gave rise to the Sultanate of Rum in Anatolia, while taking their thoroughly Persianized identity with them. The result of the adoption and patronage of Iranian culture by Turkish rulers was the development of a distinct Turko-Persian tradition.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">From 1219 to 1221, under the Khwarazmian Empire, Iran suffered a devastating invasion by the Mongol army of Genghis Khan. According to Steven R. Ward, &#8220;Mongol violence and depredations killed up to three-fourths of the population of the Iranian Plateau, possibly 10 to 15 million people. Some historians have estimated that Iran&#8217;s population did not again reach its pre-Mongol levels until the mid-20th century.&#8221;<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Following the fracture of the Mongol Empire in 1256, Hulagu Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan, established the Ilkhanate in Iran. In 1370, yet another conqueror, Timur, followed the example of Hulagu, establishing the Timurid Empire which lasted for another 156 years. In 1387, Timur ordered the complete massacre of Isfahan, reportedly killing 70,000 citizens. The Ilkhans and the Timurids soon came to adopt the ways and customs of the Iranians, surrounding themselves with a culture that was distinctively Iranian.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Early modern period. <\/strong>By the 1500s, Ismail I of Ardabil established the Safavid Empire, with his capital at Tabriz. Beginning with Azerbaijan, he subsequently extended his authority over all of the Iranian territories, and established an intermittent Iranian hegemony over the vast relative regions, reasserting the Iranian identity within large parts of Greater Iran. Iran was predominantly Sunni, but Ismail instigated a forced conversion to the Shia branch of Islam, spreading throughout the Safavid territories in the Caucasus, Iran, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia. As a result, modern-day Iran is the only official Shia nation of the world, with it holding an absolute majority in Iran and the Republic of Azerbaijan, having there the first and the second highest number of Shia inhabitants by population percentage in the world. Meanwhile, the centuries-long geopolitical and ideological rivalry between Safavid Iran and the neighboring Ottoman Empire led to numerous Ottoman\u2013Iranian wars<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The Safavid era peaked in the reign of Abbas I (1587\u20131629), surpassing their Turkish archrivals in strength, and making Iran a leading science and art hub in western Eurasia. The Safavid era saw the start of mass integration from Caucasian populations into new layers of the society of Iran, as well as mass resettlement of them within the heartlands of Iran, playing a pivotal role in the history of Iran for centuries onwards. Following a gradual decline in the late 1600s and the early 1700s, which was caused by internal conflicts, the continuous wars with the Ottomans, and the foreign interference (most notably the Russian interference), the Safavid rule was ended by the Pashtun rebels who besieged Isfahan and defeated Sultan Husayn in 1722.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In 1729, Nader Shah, a chieftain and military genius from Khorasan, successfully drove out and conquered the Pashtun invaders. He subsequently took back the annexed Caucasian territories which were divided among the Ottoman and Russian authorities by the ongoing chaos in Iran. During the reign of Nader Shah, Iran reached its greatest extent since the Sasanian Empire, reestablishing the Iranian hegemony all over the Caucasus, as well as other major parts of the west and central Asia, and briefly possessing what was arguably the most powerful empire at the time.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Nader Shah invaded India and sacked far off Delhi by the late 1730s. His territorial expansion, as well as his military successes, went into a decline following the final campaigns in the Northern Caucasus against then revolting Lezgins. The assassination of Nader Shah sparked a brief period of civil war and turmoil, after which Karim Khan of the Zand dynasty came to power in 1750, bringing a period of relative peace and prosperity.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Compared to its preceding dynasties, the geopolitical reach of the Zand dynasty was limited. Many of the Iranian territories in the Caucasus gained de facto autonomy, and were locally ruled through various Caucasian khanates. However, despite the self-ruling, they all remained subjects and vassals to the Zand king. Another civil war ensued after the death of Karim Khan in 1779, out of which Agha Mohammad Khan emerged, founding the Qajar dynasty in 1794. In 1795, following the disobedience of the Georgian subjects and their alliance with the Russians, the Qajars captured Tbilisi by the Battle of Krtsanisi, and drove the Russians out of the entire Caucasus, reestablishing the Iranian suzerainty over the region.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>From the 1800s to the 1940s. <\/strong>The Russo-Iranian wars of 1804\u20131813 and 1826\u20131828 resulted in large irrevocable territorial losses for Iran in the Caucasus, comprising all of Transcaucasia and Dagestan, which made part of the very concept of Iran for centuries, and thus substantial gains for the neighboring Russian Empire.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">As a result of the 19th-century Russo-Iranian wars, the Russians took over the Caucasus, and Iran irrevocably lost control over its integral territories in the region (comprising modern-day Dagestan, Georgia, Armenia, and Republic of Azerbaijan), which got confirmed per the treaties of Gulistan and Turkmenchay. The area to the north of Aras River, among which the contemporary Republic of Azerbaijan, eastern Georgia, Dagestan, and Armenia are located, were Iranian territory until they were occupied by Russia in the course of the 19th century.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">As Iran shrank, many Transcaucasian and North Caucasian Muslims moved towards Iran, especially until the aftermath of the Circassian Genocide, and the decades afterwards, while Iran&#8217;s Armenians were encouraged to settle in the newly incorporated Russian territories, causing significant demographic shifts.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Around 1.5 million people\u201420 to 25% of the population of Iran\u2014died as a result of the Great Famine of 1870\u20131871<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Between 1872 and 1905, a series of protests took place in response to the sale of concessions to foreigners by Qajar monarchs Naser-ed-Din and Mozaffar-ed-Din, and led to the Constitutional Revolution in 1905. The first Iranian constitution and the first national parliament of Iran were founded in 1906, through the ongoing revolution. The Constitution included the official recognition of Iran&#8217;s three religious minorities, namely Christians, Jews, and Zoroastrians, which has remained a basis in the legislation of Iran since then. The struggle related to the constitutional movement was followed by the Triumph of Tehran in 1909, when Mohammad Ali Shah was defeated and forced to abdicate. On the pretext of restoring order, the Russians occupied northern Iran in 1911 and maintained a military presence in the region for years to come. But this did not put an end to the civil uprisings and was soon followed by Mirza Kuchik Khan&#8217;s Jungle Movement against both the Qajar monarchy and foreign invaders.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">During World War I, the British occupied much of the territory of western Iran, and fully withdrew in 1921. Meanwhile, a famine in northern Iran killed between eight and 10 million people. The Persian Campaign commenced furthermore in northwestern Iran after an Ottoman invasion, as part of the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I. In the course of the Assyrian Genocide of 1914\u20131920 and the Armenian Genocide of 1915\u20131917, a large number of Iranian Assyrians and Armenians were subjected to mass murders committed by the Ottoman troops that were crossing the northwestern border, notably in and around Khoy, Maku, Salmas, and Urmia.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Apart from the rule of Agha Mohammad Khan, the Qajar rule is characterized as a century of misrule. The Iranian Cossack Brigade, which was the most effective military force available to the crown, began a military coup supported by the British in February 1921. The Qajar dynasty was subsequently overthrown, and Reza Khan, the former general of the Cossack Brigade, became the new Prime Minister of Iran. Eventually, he was declared the new monarch in 1925\u2014thence known as Reza Shah\u2014establishing the Pahlavi dynasty.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In the midst of World War II, in 1941, Nazi Germany launched Operation Barbarossa and invaded the Soviet Union, breaking the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact. This had a major impact on Iran, which had declared neutrality in the conflicts. Later that year, following an Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran, Reza Shah was forced to abdicate in favor of his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Subsequently, Iran became a major conduit for British and American aid to the Soviet Union, until the end of the ongoing war.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">At the 1943 Tehran Conference, the Allied &#8220;Big Three&#8221;\u2014Joseph Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Winston Churchill\u2014issued the Tehran Declaration to guarantee the post-war independence and boundaries of Iran. However, at the end of the war, Soviet troops remained in Iran and local pro-Soviet groups established two puppet states in north-western Iran, namely the People&#8217;s Government of Azerbaijan and the Republic of Mahabad. Receiving a promise of oil concessions, the Soviets withdrew from Iran proper in May 1946. The two puppet states were soon overthrown following the Iran crisis of 1946, and the oil concessions were revoked.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Contemporary era. <\/strong>In 1951, Mohammad Mosaddegh was appointed as the Prime Minister. He became enormously popular in Iran after he nationalized Iran&#8217;s petroleum industry and oil reserves. He was deposed in the 1953 Iranian coup d&#8217;\u00e9tat, an Anglo-American covert operation that marked the first time the United States had participated in the overthrow of a foreign government during the Cold War.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">After the coup, the Shah became increasingly autocratic and sultanistic, and Iran entered a phase of decades-long controversial close relations with the United States and some other foreign governments. While the Shah increasingly modernized Iran and claimed to retain it as a fully secular state, arbitrary arrests and torture by his secret police, the SAVAK, were used to crush all forms of political opposition.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Ruhollah Khomeini, a radical Muslim cleric, became an active critic of the Shah&#8217;s far-reaching series of reforms known as the White Revolution. Khomeini publicly denounced the government, and was arrested and imprisoned for 18 months. After his release in 1964, he refused to apologize, and was eventually sent into exile.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Due to the 1973 spike in oil prices, the economy of Iran was flooded with foreign currency, which caused inflation. By 1974, the economy of Iran was experiencing double digit inflation, and despite the many large projects to modernize the country, corruption was rampant and caused large amounts of waste. By 1975 and 1976, an economic recession led to increased unemployment, especially among millions of youth who had migrated to the cities of Iran looking for construction jobs during the boom years of the early 1970s. By the late 1970s, many of these people opposed the Shah&#8217;s regime and began to organize and join the protests against it.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The 1979 Revolution, later known as the Islamic Revolution, began in January 1978 with the first major demonstrations against the Shah. After a year of strikes and demonstrations paralyzing the country and its economy, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi fled to the United States, and Ruhollah Khomeini returned from exile to Tehran in February 1979, forming a new government. After holding a referendum, Iran officially became an Islamic republic in April 1979. A second referendum in December 1979 approved a theocratic constitution.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The immediate nationwide uprisings against the new government began with the 1979 Kurdish rebellion and the Khuzestan uprisings, along with the uprisings in Sistan and Baluchestan and other areas. Over the next several years, these uprisings were subdued in a violent manner by the new Islamic government. The new government began purging itself of the non-Islamist political opposition, as well as of those Islamists who were not considered radical enough. Although both nationalists and Marxists had initially joined with Islamists to overthrow the Shah, tens of thousands were executed by the new regime afterwards. Many former ministers and officials in the Shah&#8217;s government, including former prime minister Amir-Abbas Hoveyda, were brutally shot dead by firing squads on Khomeini&#8217;s order to purge the new government of any remaining officials still loyal to the exiled Shah.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">On 4 November 1979, a group of Muslim students seized the United States Embassy and took the embassy with 52 personnel and citizens hostage, after the United States refused to extradite Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to Iran, where his execution was all but assured. Attempts by the Jimmy Carter administration to negotiate for the release of the hostages, and a failed rescue attempt, helped force Carter out of office and brought Ronald Reagan to power. On Jimmy Carter&#8217;s final day in office, the last hostages were finally set free as a result of the Algiers Accords. Mohammad Reza Pahlavi left the United States for Egypt, where he died of complications from cancer only months later, on July 27, 1980.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The Cultural Revolution began in 1980, with an initial closure of universities for three years, in order to perform an inspection and clean up in the cultural policy of the education and training system.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">On 22 September 1980, the Iraqi army invaded the western Iranian province of Khuzestan, launching the Iran\u2013Iraq War. Although the forces of Saddam Hussein made several early advances, by mid 1982, the Iranian forces successfully managed to drive the Iraqi army back into Iraq. In July 1982, with Iraq thrown on the defensive, the regime of Iran took the decision to invade Iraq and conducted countless offensives in a bid to conquer Iraqi territory and capture cities, such as Basra. The war continued until 1988 when the Iraqi army defeated the Iranian forces inside Iraq and pushed the remaining Iranian troops back across the border. Subsequently, Khomeini accepted a truce mediated by the United Nations. The total Iranian casualties in the war were estimated to be 123,220\u2013160,000 KIA, 60,711 MIA, and 11,000\u201316,000 civilians killed.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Following the Iran\u2013Iraq War, in 1989, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and his administration concentrated on a pragmatic pro-business policy of rebuilding and strengthening the economy without making any dramatic break with the ideology of the revolution. In 1997, Rafsanjani was succeeded by moderate reformist Mohammad Khatami, whose government attempted, unsuccessfully, to make the country more free and democratic.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The 2005 presidential election brought conservative populist candidate, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to power. By the time of the 2009 Iranian presidential election, the Interior Ministry announced incumbent President Ahmadinejad had won 62.63% of the vote, while Mir-Hossein Mousavi had come in second place with 33.75%. The election results were widely disputed, and resulted in widespread protests, both within Iran and in major cities outside the country, and the creation of the Iranian Green Movement.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Hassan Rouhani was elected as the president on 15 June 2013, defeating Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf and four other candidates. The electoral victory of Rouhani has relatively improved the relations of Iran with other countries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>GEOGRAPHY<br \/>\n<\/strong>Iran has an area of 1,648,195\u00a0km2 (636,372\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). It lies between latitudes 24\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 N, and longitudes 44\u00b0 and 64\u00b0 E. It is bordered to the northwest by Armenia (35\u00a0km or 22\u00a0mi), the Azeri exclave of Nakhchivan (179\u00a0km or 111\u00a0mi), and the Republic of Azerbaijan (611\u00a0km or 380\u00a0mi); to the north by the Caspian Sea; to the northeast by Turkmenistan (992\u00a0km or 616\u00a0mi); to the east by Afghanistan (936\u00a0km or 582\u00a0mi) and Pakistan (909\u00a0km or 565\u00a0mi); to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman; and to the west by Iraq (1,458\u00a0km or 906\u00a0mi) and Turkey (499\u00a0km or 310\u00a0mi).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Iran consists of the Iranian Plateau, with the exception of the coasts of the Caspian Sea and Khuzestan. It is one of the world&#8217;s most mountainous countries, its landscape dominated by rugged mountain ranges that separate various basins or plateaux from one another. The populous western part is the most mountainous, with ranges such as the Caucasus, Zagros, and Alborz, the last containing Mount Damavand, Iran&#8217;s highest point at 5,610\u00a0m (18,406\u00a0ft), which is also the highest mountain on the Eurasian landmass west of the Hindu Kush.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The northern part of Iran is covered by the lush lowland Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests, located near the southern shores of the Caspian Sea. The eastern part consists mostly of desert basins, such as the Kavir Desert, which is the country&#8217;s largest desert, and the Lut Desert, as well as some salt lakes.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The only large plains are found along the coast of the Caspian Sea and at the northern end of the Persian Gulf, where the country borders the mouth of the Arvand river. Smaller, discontinuous plains are found along the remaining coast of the Persian Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz, and the Gulf of Oman.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Climate.\u00a0<\/strong>Having 11 climates out of the world&#8217;s 13, Iran&#8217;s climate is diverse, ranging from arid and semi-arid, to subtropical along the Caspian coast and the northern forests. On the northern edge of the country (the Caspian coastal plain), temperatures rarely fall below freezing and the area remains humid for the rest of the year. Summer temperatures rarely exceed 29\u00a0\u00b0C (84.2\u00a0\u00b0F). Annual precipitation is 680\u00a0mm (26.8\u00a0in) in the eastern part of the plain and more than 1,700\u00a0mm (66.9\u00a0in) in the western part. Gary Lewis, the United Nations Resident Coordinator for Iran, has said that &#8220;Water scarcity poses the most severe human security challenge in Iran today&#8221;.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">To the west, settlements in the Zagros basin experience lower temperatures, severe winters with below zero average daily temperatures and heavy snowfall. The eastern and central basins are arid, with less than 200\u00a0mm (7.9\u00a0in) of rain, and have occasional deserts. Average summer temperatures rarely exceed 38\u00a0\u00b0C (100.4\u00a0\u00b0F). The coastal plains of the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman in southern Iran have mild winters, and very humid and hot summers. The annual precipitation ranges from 135 to 355\u00a0mm (5.3 to 14.0\u00a0in).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Fauna<br \/>\n<\/strong>The wildlife of Iran is composed of several animal species, including bears, the Eurasian lynx, foxes, gazelles, gray wolves, jackals, panthers, and wild pigs. Other domestic animals of Iran include Asian water buffaloes, camels, cattle, donkeys, goats, horses, and the sheep. Eagles, falcons, partridges, pheasants, and storks are also native to the wildlife of Iran.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">One of the most famous members of the Iranian wildlife is the critically endangered Asiatic cheetah, also known as the Iranian cheetah, whose numbers were greatly reduced after the 1979 Revolution. The Persian leopard, which is the world&#8217;s largest leopard subspecies living primarily in northern Iran, is also listed as an endangered species. Iran lost all its Asiatic lions and the now extinct Caspian tigers by the earlier part of the 20th century.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">At least 74 species of the Iranian wildlife are on the red list of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, a sign of serious threats against the country&#8217;s biodiversity. The Iranian Parliament has been showing disregard for wildlife by passing laws and regulations such as the act that lets the Ministry of Industries and Mines exploit mines without the involvement of the Department of Environment, and by approving large national development projects without demanding comprehensive study of their impact on wildlife habitats.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>ADMIMISTRATIVE DIVISIONS<br \/>\n<\/strong>Iran is divided into five regions with thirty-one provinces (ost\u0101n), each governed by an appointed governor (ost\u0101nd\u0101r). The provinces are divided into counties (\u0161ahrest\u0101n), and subdivided into districts (bax\u0161) and sub-districts (dehest\u0101n).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The country has one of the highest urban growth rates in the world. From 1950 to 2002, the urban proportion of the population increased from 27% to 60%. The United Nations predicts that by 2030, 80% of the population will be urban. Most internal migrants have settled around the cities of Tehran, Isfahan, Ahvaz, and Qom. The listed populations are from the 2006\/07 census <strong>Tehran,<\/strong> with a population of around 8.8 million (2016 census), is the capital and largest city of Iran. It is an economical and cultural center, and is the hub of the country&#8217;s communication and transport network.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The country&#8217;s second most populous city, <strong>Mashhad<\/strong>, has a population of around 3.3 million (2016 census), and is capital of the province of Razavi Khorasan. Being the site of the Imam Reza Shrine, it is a holy city in Shia Islam. About 15 to 20 million pilgrims visit the shrine every year.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Isfahan<\/strong> has a population of around 2.2 million (2016 census), and is Iran&#8217;s third most populous city. It is the capital of the province of Isfahan, and was also the third capital of the Safavid Empire. It is home to a wide variety of historical sites, including the famous Shah Square, Siosepol, and the churches at the Armenian district of New Julfa. It is also home to the world&#8217;s seventh largest shopping mall, Isfahan City Center.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The fourth most populous city of Iran, <strong>Karaj,<\/strong> has a population of around 1.9 million (2016 census). It is the capital of the province of Alborz, and is situated 20\u00a0km west of Tehran, at the foot of the Alborz mountain range. It is a major industrial city in Iran, with large factories producing sugar, textiles, wire, and alcohol.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">With a population of around 1.7 million (2016 census), <strong>Tabriz<\/strong> is the fifth most populous city of Iran, and had been the second most populous until the late 1960s. It was the first capital of the Safavid Empire, and is now the capital of the province of East Azerbaijan. It is also considered the country&#8217;s second major industrial city (after Tehran).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Shiraz,<\/strong> with a population of around 1.8 million (2016 census), is Iran&#8217;s sixth most populous city. It is the capital of the province of Fars, and was also the capital of Iran under the reign of the Zand dynasty. It is located near the ruins of Persepolis and Pasargadae, two of the four capitals of the Achaemenid Empire.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS<br \/>\n<\/strong>The political system of the Islamic Republic is based on the 1979 Constitution. According to international reports, Iran&#8217;s human rights record is exceptionally poor. The regime in Iran is undemocratic, has frequently persecuted and arrested critics of the government and its Supreme Leader, and severely restricts the participation of candidates in popular elections as well as other forms of political activity. Women&#8217;s rights in Iran are described as seriously inadequate, and children&#8217;s rights have been severely violated, with more child offenders being executed in Iran than in any other country in the world. Sexual activity between members of the same sex is illegal and is punishable by up to death. Since the 2000s, Iran&#8217;s controversial nuclear program has raised concerns, which is part of the basis of the international sanctions against the country. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, an agreement reached between Iran and the P5+1, was created on 14 July 2015, aimed to loosen the nuclear sanctions in exchange for Iran&#8217;s restriction in producing enriched uranium.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Supreme Leader. <\/strong>The Leader of the Revolution (&#8220;Supreme Leader&#8221;) is responsible for delineation and supervision of the policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Iranian president has limited power compared to the Supreme Leader Khamenei. The current longtime Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, has been issuing decrees and making the final decisions on the economy, environment, foreign policy, education, national plannings, and everything else in the country. Khamenei also outlines elections guidelines and urges for the transparency, and has fired and reinstated presidential cabinet appointments. Key ministers are selected with the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei&#8217;s agreement and he has the ultimate say on Iran&#8217;s foreign policy. The president-elect is required to gain the Leader Khamenei&#8217;s official approval before being sworn in before the Parliament (Majlis). Through this process, known as Tanfiz (validation), the Leader agrees to the outcome of the presidential election. The Supreme Leader is directly involved in ministerial appointments for Defense, Intelligence and Foreign Affairs, as well as other top ministries after submission of candidates from the president. Iran&#8217;s regional policy is directly controlled by the office of the Supreme Leader with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs&#8217; task limited to protocol and ceremonial occasions. All of Iran&#8217;s ambassadors to Arab countries, for example, are chosen by the Quds Corps, which directly reports to the Supreme Leader. The budget bill for every year, as well as withdrawing money from the National Development Fund of Iran, require Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei&#8217;s approval and permission. The Supreme Leader Khamenei can and did order laws to be amended. Setad, estimated at $95 billion in 2013 by the Reuters, accounts of which are secret even to the Iranian parliament, is controlled only by the Supreme Leader.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The Supreme Leader is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, controls the military intelligence and security operations, and has sole power to declare war or peace. The heads of the judiciary, the state radio and television networks, the commanders of the police and military forces, and six of the 12 members of the Guardian Council are directly appointed by the Supreme Leader.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The Assembly of Experts elects and dismisses (to date, never did) the Supreme Leader on the basis of qualifications and popular esteem. To date, the Assembly of Experts has not challenged any of the Supreme Leader&#8217;s decisions. The current head of the judicial system, Sadeq Larijani, appointed by the longtime Supreme Leader, said that it is illegal for the Assembly of Experts to supervise the Supreme Leader. Due to Khamenei&#8217;s very longtime unchallenged rule, many believe the Assembly of Experts has become a ceremonial body without any real power. There have been instances when the current Supreme Leader publicly criticized members of the Assembly of Experts, resulting in their arrest and dismissal. For example, Khamenei publicly called then-member of the Assembly of Experts Ahmad Azari Qomi a traitor, resulting in Qomi&#8217;s arrest and eventual dismissal from the Assembly of Experts. Another instance is when Khamenei indirectly called Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani a traitor for a statement he made, resulting Rafsanjani to retract it.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Guardian Council. <\/strong>Presidential candidates and parliamentary candidates must be approved by the Guardian Council (all members of which are directly or indirectly elected by the Leader) or the Leader before running, in order to ensure their allegiance to the Supreme Leader. The Leader very rarely does the vetting himself directly, but has the power to do so, in which case additional approval of the Guardian Council would not be needed. The Leader can also revert the decisions of the Guardian Council. The Guardian Council can, and has dismissed some elected members of the Iranian parliament in the past. For example, Minoo Khaleghi was disqualified by Guardian Council even after winning election, as she had been photographed in a meeting without wearing headscarf.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>President. <\/strong>After the Supreme Leader, the Constitution defines the President of Iran as the highest state authority. The President is elected by universal suffrage for a term of four years, however, the president is still required to gain the Leader&#8217;s official approval before being sworn in before the Parliament (Majlis). The Leader also has the power to dismiss the elected president anytime. The President can only be re-elected for one term.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The President is responsible for the implementation of the constitution, and for the exercise of executive powers in implementing the decrees and general policies as outlined by the Supreme Leader, except for matters directly related to the Supreme Leader, who has the final say in all matters. Unlike the executive in other countries, the President of Iran does not have full control over anything, as these are ultimately under the control of the Supreme Leader. Chapter IX of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran sets forth the qualifications for presidential candidates. The procedures for presidential election and all other elections in Iran are outlined by the Supreme Leader. The President functions as the executive of affairs such as signing treaties and other international agreements, and administering national planning, budget, and state employment affairs, all as approved by the Supreme Leader.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The President appoints the ministers, subject to the approval of the Parliament, as well as the approval of the Supreme Leader, who can dismiss or reinstate any of the ministers at any time, regardless of the decisions made by the President or the Parliament. The President supervises the Council of Ministers, coordinates government decisions, and selects government policies to be placed before the legislature. The current Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, has fired as well as reinstated Council of Ministers members. Eight Vice Presidents serve under the President, as well as a cabinet of twenty-two ministers, who must all be approved by the legislature.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Legislature. <\/strong>The legislature of Iran, known as the Islamic Consultative Assembly, is a unicameral body comprising 290 members elected for four-year terms. It drafts legislation, ratifies international treaties, and approves the national budget. All parliamentary candidates and all legislation from the assembly must be approved by the Guardian Council.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The Guardian Council comprises twelve jurists, including six appointed by the Supreme Leader. Others are elected by the Parliament, from among the jurists nominated by the Head of the Judiciary. The Council interprets the constitution and may veto the Parliament. If a law is deemed incompatible with the constitution or Sharia (Islamic law), it is referred back to the Parliament for revision. The Expediency Council has the authority to mediate disputes between the Parliament and the Guardian Council, and serves as an advisory body to the Supreme Leader, making it one of the most powerful governing bodies in the country. Local city councils are elected by public vote to four-year terms in all cities and villages of Iran.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Law. <\/strong>The Supreme Leader appoints the head of the country&#8217;s judiciary, who in turn appoints the head of the Supreme Court and the chief public prosecutor. There are several types of courts, including public courts that deal with civil and criminal cases, and revolutionary courts which deal with certain categories of offenses, such as crimes against national security. The decisions of the revolutionary courts are final and cannot be appealed.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The Special Clerical Court handles crimes allegedly committed by clerics, although it has also taken on cases involving laypeople. The Special Clerical Court functions independently of the regular judicial framework, and is accountable only to the Supreme Leader. The Court&#8217;s rulings are final and cannot be appealed. The Assembly of Experts, which meets for one week annually, comprises 86 &#8220;virtuous and learned&#8221; clerics elected by adult suffrage for eight-year terms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>FOREIGN RELATIONS<br \/>\n<\/strong>The officially stated goal of the government of Iran is to establish a new world order based on world peace, global collective security, and justice. Since the time of the 1979 Revolution, Iran&#8217;s foreign relations have often been portrayed as being based on two strategic principles; eliminating outside influences in the region, and pursuing extensive diplomatic contacts with developing and non-aligned countries.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Since 2005, Iran&#8217;s nuclear program has become the subject of contention with the international community, mainly the United States. Many countries have expressed concern that Iran&#8217;s nuclear program could divert civilian nuclear technology into a weapons program. This has led the United Nations Security Council to impose sanctions against Iran which had further isolated Iran politically and economically from the rest of the global community. In 2009, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence said that Iran, if choosing to, would not be able to develop a nuclear weapon until 2013.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">As of 2009, the government of Iran maintains diplomatic relations with 99 members of the United Nations, but not with the United States, and not with Israel\u2014a state which Iran&#8217;s government has derecognized since the 1979 Revolution. Among Muslim nations, Iran has an adversarial relationship with Saudi Arabia due to different political and Islamic ideologies. While Iran is a Shia Islamic Republic, Saudi Arabia is a conservative Sunni monarchy. Regarding the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, the government of Iran has recognized Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Palestine, after Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">On 14 July 2015, Tehran and the P5+1 came to a historic agreement (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) to end economic sanctions after demonstrating a peaceful nuclear research project that would meet the International Atomic Energy Agency standards<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Iran is a member of dozens of international organizations, including the G-15, G-24, G-77, IAEA, IBRD, IDA, IDB, IFC, ILO, IMF, IMO, Interpol, OIC, OPEC,[282] WHO, and the United Nations, and currently has observer status at the World Trade Organization.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In September 2018, Iran ambassador to the United Nations asked the UN to condemn Israeli threats against Tehran and also bring Israel&#8217;s nuclear program under the International Atomic Energy Agency&#8217;s supervision.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In April 2019 the U.S. threatened to sanction countries continuing to buy oil from Iran after an initial six-month waiver announced in November expired. According to the BBC, U.S. sanctions against Iran &#8220;have led to a sharp downturn in Iran&#8217;s economy, pushing the value of its currency to record lows, quadrupling its annual inflation rate, driving away foreign investors, and triggering protests.&#8221;<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">On September 1, 2019, the Iranian authorities took a step to enhance its relations with Qatar, and decided to grant Qatari passport holders tourist visas upon arrival at Iranian airports. Besides, Qatari nationals were also permitted to obtain a single or multiple-entry visa from Iran&#8217;s embassy in Doha.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>MILITARY<br \/>\n<\/strong>The Islamic Republic of Iran has two types of armed forces: the regular forces of the Army, the Air Force, and the Navy, and the Revolutionary Guards, totaling about 545,000 active troops. Iran also has around 350,000 Reserve Force, totaling around 900,000 trained troops.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The government of Iran has a paramilitary, volunteer militia force within the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, called the Basij, which includes about 90,000 full-time, active-duty uniformed members. Up to 11 million men and women are members of the Basij who could potentially be called up for service. GlobalSecurity.org estimates Iran could mobilize &#8220;up to one million men&#8221;, which would be among the largest troop mobilizations in the world. In 2007, Iran&#8217;s military spending represented 2.6% of the GDP or $102 per capita, the lowest figure of the Persian Gulf nations. Iran&#8217;s military doctrine is based on deterrence. In 2014, the country spent $15 billion on arms, while the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council spent eight times more. The United States under President Donald Trump officially labeled the Revolutionary Guard as a foreign terrorist organization. It is the first time that an element of a foreign state was designated as a terrorist organization.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The government of Iran supports the military activities of its allies in Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon (Hezbollah) with military and financial aid. Iran and Syria are close strategic allies, and Iran has provided significant support for the Syrian Government in the Syrian Civil War. According to some estimates, Iran controlled over 80,000 pro-Assad Shi&#8217;ite fighters in Syria.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Since the 1979 Revolution, to overcome foreign embargoes, the government of Iran has developed its own military industry, produced its own tanks, armored personnel carriers, missiles, submarines, military vessels, missile destroyer, radar systems, helicopters, and fighter planes. In recent years, official announcements have highlighted the development of weapons such as the Hoot, Kowsar, Zelzal, Fateh-110, Shahab-3, Sejjil, and a variety of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).[298] Iran has the largest and most diverse ballistic missile arsenal in the Middle East. The Fajr-3, a liquid fuel missile with an undisclosed range which was developed and produced domestically, is currently the most advanced ballistic missile of the country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>ECONOMY<br \/>\n<\/strong>Tehran is the economic center of Iran, hosting 45% of the country&#8217;s industries.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Iran&#8217;s economy is a mixture of central planning, state ownership of oil and other large enterprises, village agriculture, and small-scale private trading and service ventures. In 2017, GDP was $427.7 billion ($1.631 trillion at PPP), or $20,000 at PPP per capita. Iran is ranked as an upper-middle income economy by the World Bank. In the early 21st century, the service sector contributed the largest percentage of the GDP, followed by industry (mining and manufacturing) and agriculture.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran is responsible for developing and maintaining the Iranian rial, which serves as the country&#8217;s currency. The government doesn&#8217;t recognize trade unions other than the Islamic labour councils, which are subject to the approval of employers and the security services. The minimum wage in June 2013 was 487 million rials a month ($134). Unemployment has remained above 10% since 1997, and the unemployment rate for women is almost double that of the men.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In 2006, about 45% of the government&#8217;s budget came from oil and natural gas revenues, and 31% came from taxes and fees. As of 2007, Iran had earned $70 billion in foreign-exchange reserves, mostly (80%) from crude oil exports. Iranian budget deficits have been a chronic problem, mostly due to large-scale state subsidies, that include foodstuffs and especially gasoline, totaling more than $84 billion in 2008 for the energy sector alone. In 2010, the economic reform plan was approved by parliament to cut subsidies gradually and replace them with targeted social assistance. The objective is to move towards free market prices in a five-year period and increase productivity and social justice.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The administration continues to follow the market reform plans of the previous one, and indicates that it will diversify Iran&#8217;s oil-reliant economy. Iran has also developed a biotechnology, nanotechnology, and pharmaceutical industry.[312] However, nationalized industries such as the bonyads have often been managed badly, making them ineffective and uncompetitive with years. Currently, the government is trying to privatize these industries, and, despite successes, there are still several problems to be overcome, such as the lagging corruption in the public sector and lack of competitiveness. In 2010, Iran was ranked 69, out of 139 nations, in the Global Competitiveness Report.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Iran has leading manufacturing industries in the fields of automobile manufacture, transportation, construction materials, home appliances, food and agricultural goods, armaments, pharmaceuticals, information technology, and petrochemicals in the Middle East. According to the 2012 data from the Food and Agriculture Organization, Iran has been among the world&#8217;s top five producers of apricots, cherries, sour cherries, cucumbers and gherkins, dates, eggplants, figs, pistachios, quinces, walnuts, and watermelons.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Economic sanctions against Iran, such as the embargo against Iranian crude oil, have affected the economy. Sanctions have led to a steep fall in the value of the rial, and as of April\u00a02013, one US dollar is worth 36,000 rial, compared with 16,000 in early 2012. In 2018, after the withdrawal of the US from the JCPOA, the price of dollar hit an all-time high at just over 190,000 rials, which halted the market from trades and stores from selling goods, particularly in the consumer electronics sector until the prices were stable. In 2015, Iran and the P5+1 reached a deal on the nuclear program that removed the main sanctions pertaining to Iran&#8217;s nuclear program by 2016.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Tourism.\u00a0<\/strong>Although tourism declined significantly during the war with Iraq, it has been subsequently recovered. About 1,659,000 foreign tourists visited Iran in 2004, and 2.3 million in 2009, mostly from Asian countries, including the republics of Central Asia, while about 10% came from the European Union and North America. Since the removal of some sanctions against Iran in 2015, tourism has re-surged in the country. Over five million tourists visited Iran in the fiscal year of 2014\u20132015, four percent more than the previous year.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Alongside the capital, the most popular tourist destinations are Isfahan, Mashhad, and Shiraz. In the early 2000s, the industry faced serious limitations in infrastructure, communications, industry standards, and personnel training. The majority of the 300,000 travel visas granted in 2003 were obtained by Asian Muslims, who presumably intended to visit pilgrimage sites in Mashhad and Qom. Several organized tours from Germany, France, and other European countries come to Iran annually to visit archaeological sites and monuments. In 2003, Iran ranked 68th in tourism revenues worldwide. According to the UNESCO and the deputy head of research for Iran&#8217;s Tourism Organization, Iran is rated fourth among the top 10 destinations in the Middle East. Domestic tourism in Iran is one of the largest in the world. Weak advertising, unstable regional conditions, a poor public image in some parts of the world, and absence of efficient planning schemes in the tourism sector have all hindered the growth of tourism.|<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Energy.\u00a0<\/strong>Iran holds 10% of the world&#8217;s proven oil reserves and 15% of its gas. It is OPEC&#8217;s second largest exporter and the world&#8217;s 7th largest oil producer.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Iran has the world&#8217;s second largest proved gas reserves after Russia, with 33.6 trillion cubic metres, and the third largest natural gas production after Indonesia and Russia. It also ranks fourth in oil reserves with an estimated 153,600,000,000 barrels. It is OPEC&#8217;s second largest oil exporter, and is an energy superpower. In 2005, Iran spent US$4 billion on fuel imports, because of contraband and inefficient domestic use. Oil industry output averaged 4 million barrels per day (640,000\u00a0m3\/d) in 2005, compared with the peak of six million barrels per day reached in 1974. In the early 2000s, industry infrastructure was increasingly inefficient because of technological lags. Few exploratory wells were drilled in 2005.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In 2004, a large share of Iran&#8217;s natural gas reserves were untapped. The addition of new hydroelectric stations and the streamlining of conventional coal and oil-fired stations increased installed capacity to 33,000 megawatts. Of that amount, about 75% was based on natural gas, 18% on oil, and 7% on hydroelectric power. In 2004, Iran opened its first wind-powered and geothermal plants, and the first solar thermal plant was to come online in 2009. Iran is the world&#8217;s third country to have developed GTL technology.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Demographic trends and intensified industrialization have caused electric power demand to grow by 8% per year. The government&#8217;s goal of 53,000 megawatts of installed capacity by 2010 is to be reached by bringing on line new gas-fired plants, and adding hydropower and nuclear power generation capacity. Iran&#8217;s first nuclear power plant at Bushire went online in 2011. It is the second nuclear power plant ever built in the Middle East after the Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant in Armenia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>EDUCATION, SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY<br \/>\n<\/strong>Education in Iran is highly centralized. The adult literacy rated 93.0% in September 2015, while it had rated 85.0% in 2008, up from 36.5% in 1976.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">According to the Webometrics Ranking of World Universities (as of January\u00a02017), Iran&#8217;s top five universities include Tehran University of Medical Sciences (478th worldwide), the University of Tehran (514th worldwide), Sharif University of Technology (605th worldwide), Amirkabir University of Technology (726th worldwide), and the Tarbiat Modares University (789th worldwide).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Iran placed its domestically built satellite Omid into orbit on the 30th anniversary of the 1979 Revolution, on 2 February 2009, through its first expendable launch vehicle Safir, becoming the ninth country in the world capable of both producing a satellite and sending it into space from a domestically made launcher.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The Iranian nuclear program was launched in the 1950s. Iran is the seventh country to produce uranium hexafluoride, and controls the entire nuclear fuel cycle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>DEMOGRAPHICS.<br \/>\n<\/strong>Iran is a diverse country, consisting of numerous ethnic and linguistic groups that are unified through a shared Iranian nationality. Iran&#8217;s population grew rapidly during the latter half of the 20th century, increasing from about 19\u00a0million in 1956 to around 75 million by 2009. However, Iran&#8217;s birth rate has dropped significantly in recent years, leading to a population growth rate\u2014recorded from July 2012\u2014of about 1.29%. Studies project that the growth will continue to slow until it stabilizes above 105\u00a0million by 2050.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Iran hosts one of the largest refugee populations in the world, with more than one million refugees, mostly from Afghanistan and Iraq. Since 2006, Iranian officials have been working with the UNHCR and Afghan officials for their repatriation. According to estimates, about five million Iranian citizens have emigrated to other countries, mostly since the 1979 Revolution.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">According to the Iranian Constitution, the government is required to provide every citizen of the country with access to social security, covering retirement, unemployment, old age, disability, accidents, calamities, health and medical treatment and care services. This is covered by tax revenues and income derived from public contributions.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Languages. <\/strong>The majority of the population speak Persian, which is also the official language of the country. Others include speakers of a number of other Iranian languages within the greater Indo-European family, and languages belonging to some other ethnicities living in Iran.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In northern Iran, mostly confined to Gilan and Mazenderan, the Gilaki and Mazenderani languages are widely spoken, both having affinities to the neighboring Caucasian languages. In parts of Gilan, the Talysh language is also widely spoken, which stretches up to the neighboring Republic of Azerbaijan. Varieties of Kurdish are widely spoken in the province of Kurdistan and nearby areas. In Khuzestan, several distinct varieties of Persian are spoken. Lurish and Lari are also spoken in southern Iran.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Azerbaijani Turkish, which is by far the most spoken language in the country after Persian, as well as a number of other Turkic languages and dialects, is spoken in various regions of Iran, especially in the region of Azerbaijan.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Notable minority languages in Iran include Armenian, Georgian, Neo-Aramaic, and Arabic. Khuzi Arabic is spoken by the Arabs in Khuzestan, as well as the wider group of Iranian Arabs. Circassian was also once widely spoken by the large Circassian minority, but, due to assimilation over the many years, no sizable number of Circassians speak the language anymore.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Percentages of spoken language continue to be a point of debate, as many opt that they are politically motivated; most notably regarding the largest and second largest ethnicities in Iran, the Persians and Azerbaijanis. Percentages given by the CIA&#8217;s World Factbook include 53% Persian, 16% Azerbaijani Turkish, 10% Kurdish, 7% Mazenderani and Gilaki, 7% Lurish, 2% Turkmen, 2% Balochi, 2% Arabic, and 2% the remainder Armenian, Georgian, Neo-Aramaic, and Circassian.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Ethnic groups.\u00a0<\/strong>As with the spoken languages, the ethnic group composition also remains a point of debate, mainly regarding the largest and second largest ethnic groups, the Persians and Azerbaijanis, due to the lack of Iranian state censuses based on ethnicity. The CIA&#8217;s World Factbook has estimated that around 79% of the population of Iran are a diverse Indo-European ethno-linguistic group that comprise the speakers of the Iranian languages, with Persians (incl. Mazenderanis and Gilaks) constituting 61% of the population, Kurds 10%, Lurs 6%, and Balochs 2%. Peoples of other ethno-linguistic groups make up the remaining 21%, with Azerbaijanis constituting 16%, Arabs 2%, Turkmens and other Turkic tribes 2%, and others (such as Armenians, Talysh, Georgians, Circassians, Assyrians) 1%.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The largest population of Azerbaijanis in the world live in Iran.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Religion.\u00a0<\/strong>Historically, early Iranian religions such as the Proto-Iranic religion and the subsequent Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism were the dominant religions in Iran, particularly during the Median, Achaemenid, Parthian, and Sasanian eras. This changed after the fall of the Sasanian Empire by the centuries-long Islamization that followed the Muslim Conquest of Iran. Iran was predominantly Sunni until the conversion of the country (as well as the people of what is today the neighboring Republic of Azerbaijan) to Shia Islam by the order of the Safavid dynasty in the 16th century.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Today, Twelver Shia Islam is the official state religion, to which about 90% to 95% of the population adhere. About 4% to 8% of the population are Sunni Muslims, mainly Kurds and Baloches. The remaining 2% are non-Muslim religious minorities, including Christians, Jews, Bahais, Mandeans, Yezidis, Yarsanis, and Zoroastrians.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">There are about 3,000,000 adherents of Yarsanism, a Kurdish indigenous religion related to Zoroastrianism: making it the largest (unrecognized) minority religion in Iran. Its followers are mainly Gorani Kurds and certain groups of Lurs. They are based in Kurdistan Province, Kermanshah Province and Lorestan mainly.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Judaism has a long history in Iran, dating back to the Achaemenid conquest of Babylonia. Although many left in the wake of the establishment of the State of Israel and the 1979 Revolution, about 8,756 to 25,000 Jewish people live in Iran. Iran has the largest Jewish population in the Middle East outside of Israel.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Around 250,000 to 370,000 Christians reside in Iran, and Christianity is the country&#8217;s largest recognized minority religion. Most are of Armenian background, as well as a sizable minority of Assyrians.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Christianity, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, and the Sunni branch of Islam are officially recognized by the government, and have reserved seats in the Iranian Parliament. Bah\u00e1&#8217;\u00ed Faith, said to be the largest non-Muslim religious minority in Iran is not officially recognized, and has been persecuted during its existence in Iran since the 19th century, while according to statistics center of Iran, Bahais constitute only about 0.37% of Iran, namely about 25.000 to 40.000 people, and it is also said that there does seem to be a kind of exaggeration in declaration of their population by the order of Bahais heads. Since the 1979 Revolution, the persecution of Bahais has increased with executions and denial of civil rights, especially the denial of access to higher education and employment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>CULTURE<br \/>\n<\/strong>The earliest attested cultures in Iran date back to the Lower Paleolithic. Owing to its geopolitical position, Iran has influenced cultures as far as Greece and Italy to the west, Russia to the north, the Arabian Peninsula to the south, and south and east Asia to the east.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Art. <\/strong>The art of Iran encompasses many disciplines, including architecture, stonemasonry, metalworking, weaving, pottery, painting, and calligraphy. Iranian works of art show a great variety in style, in different regions and periods.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Architecture.\u00a0<\/strong>The history of architecture in Iran goes back to the seventh millennium BC. Iranians were among the first to use mathematics, geometry and astronomy in architecture. Iranian architecture displays great variety, both structural and aesthetic, developing gradually and coherently out of earlier traditions and experience. The guiding motif of Iranian architecture is its cosmic symbolism, &#8220;by which man is brought into communication and participation with the powers of heaven&#8221;.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Iran ranks seventh among UNESCO&#8217;s list of countries with the most archaeological ruins and attractions from antiquity.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Weaving. <\/strong>Iran&#8217;s carpet-weaving has its origins in the Bronze Age, and is one of the most distinguished manifestations of Iranian art. Iran is the world&#8217;s largest producer and exporter of handmade carpets, producing three quarters of the world&#8217;s total output and having a share of 30% of world&#8217;s export markets.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Literature.\u00a0<\/strong>Iran&#8217;s oldest literary tradition is that of Avestan, the Old Iranian sacred language of the Avesta, which consists of the legendary and religious texts of Zoroastrianism and the ancient Iranian religion, with its earliest records dating back to the pre-Achaemenid times.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Of the various modern languages used in Iran, Persian, various dialects of which are spoken throughout the Iranian Plateau, has the most influential literature. Persian has been dubbed as a worthy language to serve as a conduit for poetry, and is considered one of the four main bodies of world literature. In spite of originating from the region of Persis (better known as Persia) in southwestern Iran, the Persian language was used and developed further through Persianate societies in Asia Minor, Central Asia, and South Asia, leaving massive influences on Ottoman and Mughal literatures, among others.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Iran has a number of famous medieval poets, most notably Rumi, Ferdowsi, Hafez, Saadi Shirazi, Omar Khayyam, and Nezami Ganjavi. Iranian literature also inspired writers such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Henry David Thoreau, and Ralph Waldo Emerson.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Philosophy.\u00a0<\/strong>Iranian philosophy originates from Indo-European roots, with Zoroaster&#8217;s reforms having major influences.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">According to The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, the chronology of the subject and science of philosophy starts with the Indo-Iranians, dating this event to 1500 BC. The Oxford dictionary also states, &#8220;Zarathushtra&#8217;s philosophy entered to influence Western tradition through Judaism, and therefore on Middle Platonism.&#8221;<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">While there are ancient relations between the Indian Vedas and the Iranian Avesta, the two main families of the Indo-Iranian philosophical traditions were characterized by fundamental differences, especially in their implications for the human being&#8217;s position in society and their view of man&#8217;s role in the universe.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The Cyrus Cylinder, which is known as &#8220;the first charter of human rights&#8221;, is often seen as a reflection of the questions and thoughts expressed by Zoroaster, and developed in Zoroastrian schools of the Achaemenid era.[441][442] The earliest tenets of Zoroastrian schools are part of the extant scriptures of the Zoroastrian religion in Avestan. Among them are treatises such as the Zatspram, Shkand-gumanik Vizar, and Denkard, as well as older passages of the Avesta and the Gathas.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Mythology.\u00a0<\/strong>Iranian mythology consists of ancient Iranian folklore and stories, all involving extraordinary beings, reflecting attitudes towards the confrontation of good and evil, actions of the gods, and the exploits of heroes and fabulous creatures.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Myths play a crucial part in Iranian culture, and understanding of them is increased when they are considered within the context of actual events in Iranian history. The geography of Greater Iran, a vast area covering present-day Iran, the Caucasus, Anatolia, Mesopotamia and Central Asia, with its high mountain ranges, plays the main role in much of Iranian mythology.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Tenth-century Persian poet Ferdowsi&#8217;s long epic poem \u0160\u0101hn\u0101me (&#8220;Book of Kings&#8221;), which is for the most part based on Xwad\u0101yn\u0101mag, a Middle Persian compilation of the history of Iranian kings and heroes from mythical times down to the reign of Chosroes II, is considered the national epic of Iran. It draws heavily on the stories and characters of the Zoroastrian tradition, from the texts of the Avesta, the Denkard, and the Bundahishn.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Music.\u00a0<\/strong>Iran is the apparent birthplace of the earliest complex instruments, dating back to the third millennium BC. The use of both vertical and horizontal angular harps have been documented at the sites Madaktu and Kul-e Farah, with the largest collection of Elamite instruments documented at Kul-e Farah.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Iranian traditional musical instruments include string instruments such as chang (harp), qanun, santur, rud (oud, barbat), tar, dotar, setar, tanbur, and kamanche, wind instruments such as sorna (zurna, karna) and ney, and percussion instruments such as tompak, kus, daf (dayere), and naqare.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Iran&#8217;s first symphony orchestra, the Tehran Symphony Orchestra, was founded by Qolam-Hoseyn Minbashian in 1933. It was reformed by Parviz Mahmoud in 1946, and is currently Iran&#8217;s oldest and largest symphony orchestra.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Iranian pop music has its origins in the Qajar era.
