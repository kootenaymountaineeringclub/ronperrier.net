The conflict has been crippling the national economy, killing thousands, and causing around 200,000 Libyans to be internally displaced. The ongoing crisis is made all the more tragic when considered alongside the country\u2019s rich cultural history. Libya is home to five UNESCO World Heritage sites, including the remarkably preserved remains of Leptis Magna \u2014 described by the organization as \u201cone of the most beautiful cities of the Roman Empire.\u201d<br \/>\nUpdate 2022, Travel in Libya is very safe as one stays in the Tripoli\/Ghadamas area.

The north-western region on the Mediterranean Sea with the capital city and ancient Roman ruins.<strong><\/p>\n<p>TRIPOLI\u00a0<\/strong>(pop 1.1 million) is the\u00a0capital\u00a0and largest city of\u00a0Libya, It is located in the northwest of Libya on the edge of the\u00a0desert, on a point of rocky land projecting into the\u00a0Mediterranean Sea\u00a0and forming a bay. It includes the\u00a0port of Tripoli\u00a0and the country&#8217;s largest commercial and manufacturing center. It is also the site of the\u00a0University of Tripoli. The vast\u00a0<span title=\"Arabic-language text\"><span lang=\"ar-Latn\">Bab al-Azizia<\/span><\/span> barracks, which includes the former family estate of\u00a0Muammar Gaddafi, is also located in the city. Colonel Gaddafi largely ruled the country from his residence in his barracks.<br \/>\nTripoli was founded in the\u00a07th century BC\u00a0by the\u00a0Phoenicians, before passing into the hands of the Greek rulers of\u00a0Cyrenaica\u00a0as\u00a0Oea.\u00a0Due to the city&#8217;s long history, there are many sites of archeological significance in Tripoli.<br \/>\nTraditional walled\u00a0<em>medina<\/em> with\u00a0labyrinthine streets\u00a0that\u00a0remains quintessentially North African, with many beautiful\u00a0mosques, fountains and statues to remind of its historic role in the great Ottoman Empire.\u00a0Tripoli was called &#8220;A City of the Orient&#8221;.<strong><\/p>\n<p>Italian architecture in three neighbourhoods immediately south of Martyrs \u0301 Square. <\/strong>The breakfast at the hotel was lavish but I had no appetite. At 08:30, I met my guides and paid cash for the trip US$1750. I met my tour group and we left Tripoli for Ghadamas, a 600 km, 7-hour drive. It was a nice 11-passenger van. We used the guide&#8217;s wifi hotspot to connect to the internet.<br \/>\nAfter passing through the outskirts of Tripoli, the flat terrain initially was olive trees, then low brush and desert. The ditches are full of garbage. Military checkpoints were common and fast. The road is a good 2-lane pavement.\u00a0<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Jebel Nafusa<\/strong> &#8211; 70 km south of Tripoli is this wall of rock that rises 750 m abruptly from the desert plain to 968 meters. Mountains are bare, rugged, and without vegetation. Plains full of olive, fig, and fruit trees, and vineyards. Heartland of the Berber people.<br \/>\nWe passed three tanks from the Quaddafi era arranged into a &#8220;monument&#8221;.<br \/>\n<strong>Qasr al-Haj<\/strong> This 12th-century fortified granary has 141 storage crypts and 30 tunnels (used for storing water and oil) in a round 3-story complex. It was used by groups on the way to Mecca. Each had a door &#8211; the hinge is hard olive wood and the door soft palm wood. All are divided up by low walls for sons and grandchildren. There is residual wheat, barley and some amphorae. A man stored wheat in 1968, returned in 2008 and the wheat was still good. It was possible to walk around the upper level.<br \/>\nA large, round, elevated metal &#8220;tray&#8221; held 2500 kg of couscous when they surpassed the largest couscous dish in the world for a Guinness World record. 4 small alcoves had kitchen utensils, agricultural tools, Koran tablets, and fossils of an ostrich egg and petrified wood.<br \/>\nIt was surrounded by ruins of several buildings used as accommodation for pilgrims. A large well still had water in it.<br \/>\nFrom Wikipedia: It is a huge fortified granary of circular shape built in the 13th century AD about 130 km from Tripoli. It was built to serve as a granary for families from the surrounding area in return for the quarter of their crops, which, it is said, the owner had endowed as a waqf for teaching Qur&#8217;an and Islamic-related subjects to the people of the area. The building originally comprised 114 chambers, which could be the number of the subscribing families during the time of construction. It is also speculated that the number 114 was used symbolically to reflect the number of Sura in the Qur&#8217;an, a view widely accepted by villagers in the region nowadays. The number of chambers as of now, is 119, as a result of splitting 10 chambers due to inheritance disputes. Other changes include the addition of 29 cellars.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/www.culturalheritageonline.com\/images\/Qasr%20al-Hajj.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"346\" \/><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/castlesintheworld.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/10\/castello-di-qasr-hadj2.jpg?w=529&amp;h=349\" alt=\"Castello di Qasr-Hadj\" width=\"620\" height=\"408\" \/><br \/>\n<em><br \/>\nAfter the Qasr, it was a long, switchbacking climb up into the Nafusa Mountains.

The plateau ends abruptly on the north with a 350m escarpment. The mountain villages raise primarily goats, olives and grain, but also have fig and apricot orchards.<br \/>\nIt has most of Libya&#8217;s Berber-speaking population, who speak Nafusi Berber and practice Ibadi Islam frequently at odds with the largely orthodox Sunni population of the rest of Libya.

Established ~750 years ago, it was lived in until the 20th century. Maybe as many as 100 people lived here in houses constructed of stone walls and stone columns supporting olive\/palm tree\/rock roofs. Each family also had an underground home. There was a complete olive oil production facility with a large grinding wheel and a press &#8211; all of huge stones. The large roof was constructed identically to Anazasi kiva roofs. A courtyard led to a mosque at the end and large rocks on the edge of the cliff.<br \/>\n<em>Shortly after we stopped at a lovely restaurant for lunch &#8211; a spicy soup, salad, naan and a small tureen full of couscous, baked squash and baked chicken.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<strong>Jadu<\/strong> &#8211; capital of the Nafusa Mountains.<br \/>\n<em>After Jadu, the desert was one of the driest I&#8217;ve ever seen (comparable to the Atacama) &#8211; no plants, small rocks and sand.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<strong>Ain az Zarqa<\/strong> &#8211; natural spring\u00a0with a small, crystal-clear pool fringed by palm trees surrounded by cliffs on\u00a0three sides.

ON Ghadames Stars<br \/>\nHotel. (B, L, D)<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Day 3<\/span> Sun Sept 11.<br \/>\nGHADAMES<\/strong><br \/>\nAn oasis town on the trans-Saharan caravan routes between Timbuktu and the Mediterranean coastal cities of Libya, it sits in a huge southern desert region with amazing scenery and some of the hottest temperatures recorded anywhere in the world. Ghadames is virtually on the Algerian border near the south tip of Tunisia. The ruins of its ancient theatre, church and temples are a major attraction.<br \/>\nOld Ghadames was surrounded by a semi-circular wall. Buildings are constructed of sunbaked clay bricks on seven main streets each with a small square\u00a0used for public gatherings. Narrow roofed alleyways connect the main streets so that houses are joined allowing running along the rooftops. Men traveled along the lower streets whilst women used the upper streets between sunrise and sunset. Atmospheric with unique Saharan architecture.<br \/>\nMy experience. Our guide was Mohammed Ali, a 66-year-old former air traffic controller who is now retired.<br \/>\nGhadames was founded before Christ as the Romans were here. In 551 &#8211; Ottomans, 1911 &#8211; Italy occupied until 1943. On Jan 11, 1943, the old town was bombed by the Americans and British. 13,500 kg of bombs were dropped destroying 70 houses and severely damaging 200, 40 died, all Libyans, as the bombing did not affect the Italians (there was a plaque on one wall commemorating the event). French &#8211; 1943. Independence 1951, Quadaffi 1969-2011. The new city was started in 1970 and by 1982, all residents of the old town had left and moved. They then had running water, flush toilets (only dry toilets in the old city) and air conditioning. It is now virtually empty but there were small groups of men hanging out.<br \/>\nThere are 7 gates through the 3-4 story walls. The walls are heavily buttressed on the outside and the walls are remudded as needed so all are in good shape. The houses are 3-4 stories. We walked down Jerasan Street passing the closed Juma Mosque. The street is about 6-7 feet wide, and has palm tree joists and light wells every 10-20 metres. Doors to the houses have palm tree boards. Ones with multiple yellow\/green\/red leather patches indicated that the occupant had been on the Haj to Mecca. Originally the only address for mail was the owner&#8217;s name and street, but house numbers were added later. Electricity arrived in 1962. Niches in the walls held candles.<br \/>\nJersan Street turned into Tingazin Street, now with arched ceilings and wonderful geometric designs painted on the walls. Inset designs were also very nice. Multiple side streets branch off creating a maze of narrow alleys.<br \/>\n<strong>School.<\/strong> Supposedly the oldest in Libya, the school graces the Libyan 20 Dinar money note. Views from the roof looked out to the oasis and palm trees in one direction and back into the old town the other way. The walls were decorated with geometrics.<br \/>\nWe walked down Tafarfara Street to the main square and the large spring that supplies water to the town. It is a big, deep pool with 5 channels branching off to supply water to the town and fields. Kids were swimming as the water now is not used for drinking but only ablutions and for agriculture. The guide explained the water distribution system. A large bucket could be emptied in 3 minutes, one hour was allotted per farmer and so was able to fill 20 buckets of water.<br \/>\nWe saw many mosques, most closed. The active &#8220;new&#8221; mosque had 16 square columns. The &#8220;ancient&#8221; mosque was locked behind a bright green door. The &#8220;old&#8221; mosque dated from 668 AD.<br \/>\n<strong>Dan Magrouma House.<\/strong> Over a thousand years old, this fantastically decorated house is the most famous in the old town. The front door has markers indicating attendance at a least one Haj. First floor was stores. Second floor: large two-story room with carpets, pillows lining the walls and walls covered with mirrors, copper bowls and woven tagine covers. All the doors and small cupboard doors were fantastically designed and painted in the three colours of yellow, green and red. Third floor: the kitchen. Fourth floor: the roof. A special room off the main room was used for weddings, circumcisions and as the 4-month and 10-day mourning period for women after their husbands died (when they were only allowed to go to the toilet. She is visited by family and friends.<br \/>\nWe had lunch in the main room (cucumber\/tomato salad, soup, bread, rice and lamb) and then returned to the van to return to the hotel and a siesta.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/d\/da\/Old_Town_Of_Ghadames.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/da\/Old_Town_Of_Ghadames.jpg\/800px-Old_Town_Of_Ghadames.jpg?20170504084022\" srcset=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/da\/Old_Town_Of_Ghadames.jpg\/1200px-Old_Town_Of_Ghadames.jpg?20170504084022 1.5x, https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/d\/da\/Old_Town_Of_Ghadames.jpg?20170504084022 2x\" alt=\"File:Old Town Of Ghadames.jpg\" width=\"622\" height=\"415\" data-file-width=\"1516\" data-file-height=\"1011\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Sunset at the steep dunes close to Ghadames.\u00a0<\/strong>We hired 2 4x4s to go out to the dunes at 6 pm. We stopped first at <strong>Qasr Al Ghoul<\/strong> (ghost), a large rock with stone walls on top. It was a short hike to the top. There was an incredible well that must have been the depth of the mountain.<br \/>\nThe boys driving the 4-Runners stopped and let air out of the tires preparing to drive on the dunes. They accelerated hard and kept the revs high in low gear to climb the dunes like a dune buggy. We drove all over even on the crest of steep dunes where it got kind of freaky. They drove around so much that we missed sunset, which would have been very ordinary with no clouds on the horizon.<br \/>\nWe returned to town well after dark, had coffee at a 1000 year-old house and then another over-the-top meal. The volume of food is massive &#8211; a salad, soup, and then a large plate of rice, chicken, tagine (very good with potato base, spiced meat and pastry on top), French fries and vegetables. I didn&#8217;t bother with the large plate. Then came a large plate of fruit.<br \/>\nON Dar Ghadames Hotel. (B, L, D)<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Day 4<\/span> Mon Sept 12.<\/strong> Drive to Tripoli via Gharyan. This was a slightly different route than we took on the way to Ghadames.<br \/>\n<strong>Gharyan<\/strong> (pop 85,219) lies at the foot of the Nafusa Mountains, 50 miles (80 km) south of Tripoli. It was\u00a0on the trade routes both south to Fezzan and over the Nafusa Mountains.\u00a0 Olive oil processing, flour milling, carpet weaving, and pottery (Al-Qawasem). Troglodyte caves are famous and &#8220;Ghar&#8221; means &#8220;cave&#8221;. The caves were dug vertically down into the rocky ground.<br \/>\n<strong>Belhaj Troglodyte Home.<\/strong> We had lunch in the only troglodyte home open to tourists (there are 3000 troglodyte homes in Gharvan &#8211; each family had one). This one was built in 1666, is square, and had 8 main rooms (and 8 families). This was last lived in the 1990s although the young guide says he sleeps here every night.
