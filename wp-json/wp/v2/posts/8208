HOLMES\u00a0 \u00a0<\/strong>2498m 8195\u2019\u00a0<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">July 17 by Kim Kratky\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\nMap Slocan 82F\/14<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Mt. Holmes, part of the Kokanee Group, is 5 km. northeast of Mt. Carlyle and lies between Keen Creek and Twelve Mile Creek. \u201cBack in the day,\u201d as the kids say, it was accessed via a bridge across Keen Creek and a road up Montezuma Creek, but the bridge and road have long ago disappeared. For some years the upgraded road up Twelve Creek was gated at the Kaslo River bridge, 18.5 km. from Kaslo. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">On May 29th this year, I found the gate was removed, and so drove to about 4800\u2019 (take switchback left at km. 1.7 and then stay on mainline) for an attempt on Holmes. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Travelling solo, I gained a long north ridge but turned back at about 950-348 (7100\u2019) after 2 hrs. 45 min., as deep clefts farther south looked impassable. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">On a mid-July Sunday, I returned with Peter Tchir to finish the job. This time we drove to the end of the driveable portion of the Twelve Mile road at km. 6.1 (946-363; bridge broken out; passable for ATVs beyond this point). <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Starting at 9:30, we hiked up the road to the southwest for 10 min. past cliff bands and a narrow chasm in the creek (941-360). From this point, we headed straight up through steep, open timber to reach the crest of a north ridge (942-352), which we followed to 7550\u2019. Here, we exited left or east onto grassy meadows and descended into a spacious alpine bowl northwest of Holmes. We then traversed southeast and ascended a snow tongue to a 7800\u2019 col at 943-339. After following the ridge east for 1 km. to the base of Holmes, we finished the climb with 350\u2019 of class 3 steep, crumbly black shale on the west ridge\/southwest face. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">On top at 1:45 after a 4 \u00bc hour effort, we unsuccessfully inspected the cairn for a record, admired five lakes in the Montezuma basin to the southwest, commented on the mild and sunny weather, and speculated about ski-touring opportunities. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">At 2:30 pm, we headed down, re-tracing our steps to the basin and following it north to a rockslide at 6100\u2019, whence we re-gained the north ridge, thus avoiding its annoying portions. The ridge gave way to timbered slopes, we then slithered down steep, rhody-infested terrain to emerge on the road 100\u2019 upstream from where we had left it. As we meandered down the road, we were passed by two ATVs and a dirt bike descending from the Utica Mine site northeast of Paddy Pk. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Back to the truck just after 5:00, we calculated a 7-hour day and a brisk 2\u00bd hour descent. Excellent minor outing with a chance to explore an attractive, seldom-visited landscape. Kim Kratky<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>MT.
