Significant buildings in ancient Cuicul include a theatre, two fora, temples, basilicas, arches, streets, and houses. The exceptionally well preserved ruins surround the forum of the Harsh, a large paved square with an entry marked by a majestic arch.<br \/>\nUnder the name of Cuicul, the city was built 900 metres (3,000\u00a0ft) above sea level during the 1st century AD as a Roman military garrison situated on a narrow triangular plateau in the province of\u00a0Numidia. The terrain is somewhat rugged, being located at the\u00a0confluence\u00a0of two rivers.<br \/>\nCuicul&#8217;s builders followed a standard plan with a forum at the center and two main streets, the\u00a0Cardo Maximus\u00a0and the\u00a0Decumanus Maximus, composing the major axes. The city was initially populated by a colony of Roman soldiers from Italy, and eventually grew to become a large trading market. The resources that contributed to the prosperity of the city were essentially agricultural (cereals, olive trees and farm).<br \/>\nDuring the reign of\u00a0Caracalla\u00a0in the 3rd century, Cuicul&#8217;s administrators took down some of the old ramparts and constructed a new forum. They surrounded it with larger and more impressive edifices than those that bordered the old forum. The terrain hindered building, so that they built the theatre outside the town walls, which was exceptional.<br \/>\nChristianity became very popular in the 4th century (after some persecutions in the early third century) and brought the addition of a basilica and\u00a0baptistry. They are to the south of Cuicul in a quarter called &#8220;Christian&#8221;, and are popular attractions.<br \/>\nThe city was slowly abandoned after the fall of the Roman Empire around the 5th century and 6th century. There were some improvements under emperor\u00a0Justinian I, with wall reinforcements.<br \/>\nMuslims later dominated the region, but did not reoccupy the site of Cuicul, which they renamed Dj\u00e9mila (&#8220;beautiful&#8221; in Arabic).<\/p>\n<p><strong>TIPASA<\/strong><br \/>\nA very nice city next to Algiers with beautiful beaches and Roman ruins next to the sea.<br \/>\nSince 2002, it has been declared by UNESCO a &#8220;World Heritage Site&#8221;.<br \/>\n<strong>Roman colony. <\/strong>Initially a small ancient\u00a0Punic\u00a0trading-post turned into a military\u00a0colony\u00a0by the\u00a0emperor\u00a0Claudius\u00a0for the conquest of the kingdoms of\u00a0Mauretania, it had a population of 20,000 in the fourth century. Under Roman rule the city acquired greater commercial and military importance because of its harbour and its central position on the system of Roman coastal roads in North Africa. A wall of 2,300 metres was built around the city for defense against nomadic tribes, and Roman public buildings and districts of houses were constructed within the enclosure.<br \/>\nAll that remains are ruins of three churches \u2014 the Great Basilica and the Basilica Alexander on the western hill, and the Basilica of St Salsa on the eastern hill, two cemeteries, the baths, theatre, amphitheatre and nymphaeum. The line of the ramparts can be distinctly traced and at the foot of the eastern hill the remains of the ancient harbour.<br \/>\nThe basilicas are surrounded by cemeteries, which are full of coffins, all of stone and covered with\u00a0mosaics.<br \/>\n<strong>Christianity.<\/strong> Algeria became an important centre of Christianity in the 3rd century. In the third century Christianity was worshipped by all the Romanised Berbers and Roman colonists of Tipasa. From this period comes the oldest Christian epitaph in Roman Africa dated October 17, 237 AD. In Tipasa were built the biggest basilicas of actual Algeria: the Alexander basilica and the basilica of Saint Salsa.<br \/>\nAbout 372 Tipasa withstood an assault by Firmus, the leader of a Berber rebellion that had overrun the nearby cities of Caesarea (modern Cherchell) and Icosium (modern Algiers). Tipasa then served as the base for the Roman counter-campaign. However, Tipasa\u2019s fortifications did not prevent the city from being conquered by the Vandals about 429, bringing to an end the prosperity that the city had enjoyed during the Roman period. In 484, during the persecution of the Catholic church by the Vandal king Huneric, the Catholic bishop of Tipasa was expelled and replaced with an Arian bishop\u2014prompting many inhabitants of the city to flee to Spain. In the ensuing decades the city fell into ruin.<br \/>\nMost of the inhabitants continued to be non-Christian until, according to the legend, Salsa, a Christian maiden, threw the head of their serpent idol into the sea, whereupon the enraged populace stoned her to death. The body, miraculously recovered from the sea, was buried, on the hill above the harbour, in a small chapel which gave place subsequently to the stately basilica. Salsa&#8217;s\u00a0martyrdom\u00a0took place in the 4th century.<br \/>\n<strong>Decline.<\/strong> Tipasa was partially destroyed by the\u00a0Vandals\u00a0in 430, but was rebuilt by the Byzantines one century later. Tipasa revived for a brief time during the Byzantine occupation in the\u00a06th century but was given the\u00a0Arabic language\u00a0name,\u00a0Tefassed, when Arabs arrived there. The term translated means\u00a0badly damaged.<br \/>\nAt the end of the seventh century the city was destroyed by the\u00a0Arabs\u00a0and reduced to ruins. Modern city In 1857 was settled again the area, with the creation of the city of\u00a0Tipaza\u00a0that now has nearly 30,000 inhabitants. The town and its surroundings is home to the largest Berber-speaking group of western Algeria, the\u00a0Chenoua\u00a0people.<\/p>\n<p>Al Qal&#8217;a of Beni Hammad<\/p>\n<p>Timgad<\/p>\n<p><strong>The ROYAL MAUSOLEUMS of NUMIDIA, MAURITANIA and PRE-ISLAMIC FUNERARY MONUMENTS<\/strong>\u00a0A Tentative WHS, (17\/01\/2012), these are funerary goods produced from a brilliant original civilization, both African and Mediterranean.<br \/>\n|These royal monuments represent a selection of remarkable examples of burials dating back to different periods and from different regions.\u00a0They testify to the diversity of architectural designs and craft techniques developed over several millennia.<br \/>\nThis set consists of:<br \/>\n<strong>1. Soumaa El Khroub<\/strong> 15 km south east of Cirta, capital of the kingdom Massyle, and 570 m altitude.\u00a0It is the tomb of Massinissa grand unifier of the ancient Maghreb.\u00a0Its architecture is Greco-Punic and dates back to the 2nd century BC<br \/>\n<strong>2.

It is surrounded by a fence and you don&#8217;t miss much by not being able to go inside. This tomb looks very much like that of Tipasa &#8211; but is smaller at 18.5m high.<br \/>\nThe \u201cPunic Culture\u201d was the result of an intermingling with distinctively North African, Berber\/Numidian culture to create something still \u201cMediterranean\u201d and linked to Greece, Rome and even Egypt. The Punic remains of Carthage were of course virtually obliterated by Roman occupation and Tipasa etc also eventually became essentially Roman cities but here \u2013 near Batna some 200kms inland from the Mediterranean was something truly \u201cPunic\u201d.<br \/>\n<strong>3.
