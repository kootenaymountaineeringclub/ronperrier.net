Previously named Ainsworth, this historic village on Kootenay Lake was founded on May 31, 1883, making it the oldest surviving community on the lake.\u00a0<sup id=\"cite_ref-hanic_2-0\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>It is located on Highway 31, 18 km north of Balfour and 19 km south of Kaslo.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>History.<\/strong> The founder of Ainsworth Hot Springs was George Ainsworth,<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup> a steamboat captain from Portland, Oregon, who, with his father John, had already made a fortune operating sternwheelers on the Columbia River. Upon hearing of the discoveries of silver-lead ore in the Kootenays, the brothers travelled to British Columbia from Idaho via Bonners Ferry. On May 31, 1883, George Ainsworth received a Crown Grant of 166 acres (67 ha) at what was originally Hot Springs Camp. Ainsworth grew into a town in 1884 when &#8220;A.D. Wheeler landed there&#8221; with the first general store &#8220;started by G.B. Wright in the fall of 1888.&#8221;<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"thumbimage\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\" src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/3\/36\/Tariff_Mine_near_Ainsworth.gif\/300px-Tariff_Mine_near_Ainsworth.gif\" srcset=\"\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/3\/36\/Tariff_Mine_near_Ainsworth.gif\/450px-Tariff_Mine_near_Ainsworth.gif 1.5x, \/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/3\/36\/Tariff_Mine_near_Ainsworth.gif\/600px-Tariff_Mine_near_Ainsworth.gif 2x\" alt=\"\" width=\"629\" height=\"495\" data-file-width=\"620\" data-file-height=\"487\" \/><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Miners at Tariff Mine near Ainsworth, 1897<\/span><br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\nFrom 1884, the mountains above Ainsworth were alive with mining activity and prospectors had staked nearly every inch of ground from the townsite to the glacial summits. By 1889, several mines including Number One, Skyline, Little Donald and Krao were operating. Among the prospectors was road builder Gustavus Blin Wright, who had built part of the Old Cariboo Road. However, like many others, Wright would have no luck. Then in 1891, Eli Carpenter and John Seaton left Ainsworth for their mining claims, but returned after several futile weeks of searching. They returned to town by a route that took them over Payne Mountain, where they discovered ore samples worth CN$170 to $240 a ton. Carpenter&#8217;s and Seaton&#8217;s discoveries would be the catalyst for the Slocan Silver Rush and the region would become known as the &#8220;Silvery Slocan&#8221;.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The town of Ainsworth prospered during this period and Gold Commissioner, Henry Anderson petitioned the government for a wagon road from the town to the mines and a wharf. Both were built in 1889 and 1891, the town was visited by the new sternwheeler <i>Nelson<\/i>, the first sternwheeler built to provide service for the communities on Kootenay Lake.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div class=\"thumbinner\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"thumbimage\" src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/2\/29\/SS_Ainsworth.gif\/300px-SS_Ainsworth.gif\" srcset=\"\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/2\/29\/SS_Ainsworth.gif\/450px-SS_Ainsworth.gif 1.5x, \/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/2\/29\/SS_Ainsworth.gif\/600px-SS_Ainsworth.gif 2x\" alt=\"\" width=\"631\" height=\"410\" data-file-width=\"620\" data-file-height=\"403\" \/><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><i>City of Ainsworth<\/i><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u00a0on\u00a0Kootenay Lake\u00a0in 1894<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The\u00a0<i>Nelson<\/i> didn&#8217;t operate during the winter months and supplies had to be brought in by packhorse, driving up food prices and making such luxuries as liquor hard to come by. To solve the problems caused by this isolation, the community decided to build its own sternwheeler, one that could run all year round, connecting with Bonners Ferry. That sternwheeler was the <i>City of Ainsworth<\/i>, launched on May 4, 1892. The ill-fated boat had an unlucky launch, sliding down the ways stern first and flipping over onto her\u00a0starboard\u00a0side. She was soon righted by the steamer\u00a0<i>Galena<\/i>\u00a0and went on her maiden voyage without further incident.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Meanwhile, the town of Ainsworth continued to boom and the saloons and brothels prospered. One of the best-known hotels in town was the Olson Hotel, built by Charles Olson, who had paddled up to the area on a raft in 1883. He built the hotel when he was 21 and kept it until he died in 1926. The Olson Hotel&#8217;s most unusual feature was its two-story outhouse. The upper floor could be reached from the rooms in the second story of the hotel, while the ground floor was for patrons entering from the hotel&#8217;s grounds. The toilets were bowls with lids on top, which the proprietor&#8217;s wife kept from freezing in the winter by heating them with coal oil lamps.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"thumbimage\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\" src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/1\/14\/Mainstreet_Ainsworth.gif\/300px-Mainstreet_Ainsworth.gif\" srcset=\"\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/1\/14\/Mainstreet_Ainsworth.gif\/450px-Mainstreet_Ainsworth.gif 1.5x, \/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/1\/14\/Mainstreet_Ainsworth.gif\/600px-Mainstreet_Ainsworth.gif 2x\" alt=\"\" width=\"633\" height=\"428\" data-file-width=\"620\" data-file-height=\"419\" \/><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Main Street in Ainsworth, 1894<\/span><br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\nBy 1893, Ainsworth began to fall into a decline, while\u00a0Kaslo\u00a0became the terminus for the\u00a0Kaslo and Slocan Railway\u00a0and thus was the supply center of Kootenay Lake.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Fire was a constant hazard in these pioneer communities and on April 26, 1896, much of Ainsworth was destroyed. The fire brigade saved the Green Brothers store and several houses, but the fire burned down thirteen hotels including Olson&#8217;s. Rebuilding started immediately and most of the hotels were rebuilt. The Deering even boasted a swimming pool in its basement. Still, Ainsworth suffered in its isolation, having no roads until 1914 and not having electrical service until 1928. For many years, there was no hospital and the town&#8217;s medical needs were provided by the local\u00a0veterinarian, Dr. Henry.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Ainsworth continued in the early years of the century. The Highland Boy and the No. 1 mine provided employment. Adjoining mines at Kaslo, Coffee Creek and the Molly Gibson made Ainsworth a supply point. Mining continued at Ainsworth nearly continuously until 1953. Ainsworth never achieved the fame of the nearby Slocan district, particularly, Sandon.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Olson Hotel was torn down in 1960, but the family name is honoured by Mount Olson in the\u00a0Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park.\u00a0Another pioneer hotel, McKinnon House, survived and is now Silver Ledge. In 1963, Ainsworth officially changed its name to Ainsworth Hot Spring. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Today.
