The archipelago is made up of two populated islands, Madeira and Porto Santo, and two groups of unpopulated islands called the Desertas and Selvagens Islands. Geographically in\u00a0Africa, it is an ultra-peripheral region of the European Union. It is perhaps best known as the birthplace of the Portuguese football (soccer) player Cristiano Ronaldo.<br \/>\nMadeira island is 500 km from the African coast and 1,000 km from the European continent, only 1.5 hr flight from mainland Portugal and about 3 hr from all the main countries in Europe.<br \/>\nKnown worldwide as the Islands of eternal spring, Madeira, &#8220;Ilha Jardim&#8221; (Garden Island) or &#8220;Pearl of the Atlantic&#8221;, has a mild climate throughout the entire year. Just a short trip from Europe (4 hours from UK), one can combine holidays by the sea, in the mountains or in the city.<br \/>\nThe levadas, an ingenious system of stone- and concrete-lined watercourses distributing water from the rainy north to the dry south, help flowers and crops flourish all year. That&#8217;s why this island is called the\u00a0Garden in the Atlantic. The maintenance pathways for these water canals provide wonderful level trails for hiking in the mountains (up to 1861 m) and through the tremendous landscape.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><em style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><br \/>\nExperiences:<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/em><strong style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Fado performance<br \/>\n<\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Cozido.\u00a0<\/strong>Portuguese stew is a type of\u00a0<i>cozido<\/i>, traditional Portuguese boiled meal.\u00a0Numerous regional variations exist throughout\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Portugal, and the dish is considered part of the\u00a0Portuguese\u00a0heritage, as well as one of the\u00a0national dishes\u00a0of Portugal.\u00a0<\/span><i style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Cozido \u00e0 portuguesa<\/i><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\u00a0is prepared with a multitude of vegetables (cabbages,\u00a0beans,\u00a0potatoes,\u00a0carrots,\u00a0turnips,\u00a0rice), meat (chicken,\u00a0pork ribs,\u00a0bacon, pork\u00a0ear\u00a0and\u00a0trotters, various parts of\u00a0beef), and\u00a0smoked sausages\u00a0(chouri\u00e7o,\u00a0farinheira,\u00a0morcela, and\u00a0blood sausage), among others.

They need an\u00a0ecosystem\u00a0of high humidity, such as\u00a0cloud forests, with abundant rainfall throughout the year usually on tropical or subtropical\u00a0mountains. Laurel forests are typically multi-species, and diverse in both the number of species and the genera and families represented. Species diversity generally increases towards the tropics.\u00a0In this sense, the laurel forest is a transitional type between temperate forests and tropical rainforests.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The<\/span>\u00a0trees reach up to 40 metres (130\u00a0ft) in height.\u00a0Some species belong to the true laurel family, but many have similar foliage to the Lauraceae due to\u00a0convergent evolution and adapt to high rainfall and humidity &#8211; leaves that repel water due to a generous layer of\u00a0wax, making them glossy in appearance, and a narrow, pointed oval shape with an\u00a0apical mucro\u00a0or \u201cdrip tip\u201d, which permits the leaves to shed water despite the humidity, allowing perspiration and respiration.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Mature laurel forests typically have a dense\u00a0tree canopy\u00a0and low light levels at the forest floor.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Origin.\u00a0<\/strong>Laurel forests are composed of\u00a0vascular plants\u00a0that evolved millions of years ago including the southern beech.

They were used in the past also by women to wash clothes in areas where running water to homes was not available. The idea of this style of water channel was brought to Portugal by the\u00a0Moors\u00a0during the time of\u00a0al-Andalus. Similar examples can still be found in Iberia, such as some\u00a0Acequias\u00a0in Spain.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In the sixteenth century the Portuguese started building levadas to carry water to the agricultural regions. The most recent were made in the 1940s. Madeira is very mountainous, and building the levadas was often difficult. Many are cut into the sides of mountains, and it was also necessary to dig 25 kilometres (16\u00a0mi) of tunnels.<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Today the levadas not only supply water to the southern parts of the island, they also provide\u00a0hydroelectric power.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Hiking. There are more than 1,350 miles (2,170\u00a0km) of levadas and they provide a remarkable network of walking paths.

Has challenging hiking trails, delightful villages and demanding off-road cycling routes. Porto Santo Line ferry from Funchal is two-hour for great views of the Madeira coastline (http:\/\/www.portosantoline.pt\/index.php?lang=en. \u20ac64.20 cheaper online). Interestingly, the waters between Porto Santo and Madeira are incredible deep, descending for almost 4,000m between the two extinct volcanic islands.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The ferry moors on the western side, a 2.5km walk to the centre of Vila Baleira, or 1.2km to the very western edge of the beach (not the best section). Once out of the harbour complex, the route does follow the beach, but there are much better walks on the island. Taxis into town (\u20ac5) or local bus (\u20ac1.60). A rental car (\u20ac67 per day) for a day trip is a little excessive.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">I would suggest we <em>rent a bicycle<\/em>\u00a0to explore the island (\u20ac12per day).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Porto Santo has deforestation and erosion. When settlers first arrived in the 15th century many of the trees were cleared for farming and heavy rains washed away the nutrient rich top soil. The poor sandy soil is all that remains today, giving the distinctive yellow appearance to the island, and is difficult to grow on. Its porous consistency quickly drains away the meagre amount of rainfall.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">A guided tour is apparently the only real way to explore the whole of the island in a single day with either of two very different tour companies:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Lazermar\u00a0<u style=\"color: #ff4b33;\"><a style=\"color: #ff4b33;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.lazermar.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https:\/\/www.lazermar.com\/<\/a><\/u>provides three types of tour: small group,\u00a02-hour\u00a0coach \u20ac20 or an Off-road jeep tour to inaccessible off-road viewpoints and lasts a bone-shaking 3.5 hours.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><em>Vila Baleira<\/em>\u00a0delightful centre of white washed houses, historic buildings and Portuguese character, perfect for lunch or coffee. <em>Igreja Matriz church<\/em><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"imagecentremidpost\" src=\"https:\/\/myportugalholiday.com\/images\/madeira\/porto-santo-beach.jpg\" alt=\"beach Porto Santo\" \/><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><em>Porto Santo Beach<\/em>. 7km long sandy beach that extends along the entire southern side of the island.
