The same rings true with Greek pitas and other soft flatbread. Only tortillas have a long shelf-life.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Soups and stews are better with fresh bread.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Some breads can be easily made in a pot or frying pan. The bannock recipe can even be made over a campfire.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">With a backpacking oven you can make pizza, focaccia, muffins, rolls, and biscuits.<br \/>\nBackpacker&#8217;s Pantry used to sell the Outback Oven, but the manufacturer stopped producing them and they are no longer commercially available. They come up sporadically on eBay and that is where I purchased by second Outback Oven. You can make anything in the wild that you could make at home. There were two sizes: 10 inch that came with a non-stick &#8220;fry pan&#8221;, an aluminum lid with a central hole for the thermostat and the pot parka, a non-combustible cover that fits over the pans and holds in the heat. The 8 inch &#8220;backpacker&#8217;s&#8221; model was only an 8&#8243; pot parka and you use your own pots\/fry pan to cook. I have not seen this small pot parka for sale second hand anywhere.<br \/>\nThere are several other key elements necessary to bake, all orientated around reducing the heat available to keep the thermostat in the Bake zone and not burn the bottom. 1. stove with simmer (MSR Dragonfly) 2. heat diffusers. Corrugated plates that disperse heat and provide a platform for 3. riser bars. These clip into the diffuser plates. For best results, it may necessary to use 3 diffuser plates with bars to bake some items &#8211; high baking heat with low bottom burning potential. It takes experimentation to get best results with your equipment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>FRY BREADS<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Bannock<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Flatbread<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Lefse<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Polenta Cakes<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Corn Tortillas<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Date Nut Bread<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> <strong>OUTBACK OVEN<\/strong> Complete Instructions on Use of the Oven<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Tamale Pie<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Basic Bread<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Bread Rolls<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Pizza<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Focaccia<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Cinnamon Rolls<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Biscuit Base<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Corn Bread<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Felafel Pie<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Chocolate Muffins<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>FRY BREADS<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> <strong>1.

Makes 4 servings<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Traditionally, bannock is baked on a stick, but it also cooks well in a frying pan. Bannock is good to dip in soups or stews and also makes great sandwiches. Add a tablespoon of sugar and dried fruit to the dry ingredients for a sweet bannock. Add roasted garlic powder to some butter and use the bannock as a base for garlic bread. If you prefer to use whole wheat flour you can replace half of the all-purpose flour with all-purpose whole wheat flour.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> 1 cup all purpose flour<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> 1 tablespoon baking powder<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> 1\/8 teaspoon salt<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> 1\u20132 tablespoons vegetable oil<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> <em>At Home:<\/em> Mix the dry ingredients, and add to a ziplock bag.

Mix into a ball. Flour hands, make a smaller ball and pinch into a flat circle about 4mm thick. Cook the dough in a frying pan on medium heat. When the bottom is golden, flip the bannock to cook the top. If your pan is smaller than 9 inches in diameter, divide the dough in half and cook half at a time. You want the bannock to be about 1\/2 inch thick after cooking.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Allow to cool. Wrap any leftovers in parchment paper, and store in a ziplock freezer bag.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Bannock is delicious with rhubarb and strawberries dehydrated at home. It\u2019s also great alongside your morning eggs or your favorite soup or stew. Bannock with some cheese and shelf-stable sausage is good for lunch \u2013 make the bannock at breakfast or even the night before. For dessert, stuff with caramel and apples.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>2.

Knead the bag for 8\u201310 minutes, adding more flour if needed. Divide the dough into 6 pieces and flatten each piece into a 1\/4-inch thick circle. Heat a little of the oil in a frying pan over medium heat and fry each flatbread, flipping once, until golden brown on both sides.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> If you prefer to use whole wheat flour you can replace half of the all-purpose flour with all-purpose whole wheat flour.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Leftover flatbread can be use the next day for lunch with your favorite hummus or spread.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>3.

Use lots of flour to keep from sticking. Place on a hot 350-400? flat skillet ( I use teflon) Turn over in about 30 seconds to the other side. Then remove and place on a cloth or paper to cool. The tool used to turn and move the lefse is a thin small wooden stick that slides under the dough. I use a couple of wooden skewers. To freeze I place them between wax paper and put about 8 into ziplock bags.They will keep for several months. You can put PB or PB&amp;J, butter and sugar\/cinnamon, or whatever you like on them.

It is just like bringing dehydrated food. The backpacking pot parka is only 8&#8243; in diameter and you use your own fry pan or pot. I normally bring a scorch buster and a riser adds little weight. The whole system weighs only a few ounces.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> There&#8217;s nothing wrong with oatmeal, but freshly-baked cinnamon rolls sure taste good a week or so into a wilderness paddling trip. Consider expanding your cooking methods beyond boiling and simmering and produce downright delicious food.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> I was on a guided kayak trip in New Zealand and the guide and owner used his oven for something in every meal \u2013 pizza, cake, you name it \u2013 anything that you bake at home. He had an old, not made anymore 12\u201d outback that had more versatility (but he was always cooking for a group and needed the large size). To prevent burning, he would stack up to 3 diffuser plates each with a riser bar &#8211; great idea for the kayak gourmet.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> For trips shorter than 10 days, you can rely on fresh food the whole time. For longer excursions, try stopping every 4-5 days and spending a half-day to bake. That means bringing along an Outback Oven. That&#8217;s the secret for famous cinnamon buns along with enough fat for baking &#8211; tubs of margarine, the crucial ingredient for the blissful cinnamon buns.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Rather than portioning out &#8216;recipe mixes&#8217; in baggies, take along separate bags of flour, sugar and baking powder and make up different recipes as you go. This is much less preparation. It is possible to use the oven over the coals of a fire. Some items take a long time to cook, so this saves on fuel.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> With an oven, make carrot cake, brownies and scones with salal berries to home-made tortillas, refried beans and falafel pie.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> <strong>Equipment<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Along with a stove and basic cooking gear, the only thing you&#8217;ll need to buy is an oven. The most used is the Outback Oven Plus Ten, with a 10-inch baking pan and costs $60 at Mountain Equipment Coop. There are larger and smaller versions and a lightweight one, but the Plus Ten is just the right size for two or three hungry paddlers. The oven consists of a Teflon-coated pan, a lid with knob that serves as the oven thermometer, a circular rack to raise the pan and diffuse the flame, a reflector collar, and a fibreglass dome that fits over the whole works to keep heat in. The aluminum reflector collar, which shields the fuel tank from excessive heat, has to be custom cut to fit your stove\u2014a fiddly job. Over time, the collar can tear, so we always carry a spare (about $3).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Read and retain the booklet that comes with the oven. It contains operating instructions, baking tips, and some foolproof recipes. ddddddddOne common mistake is to try to get the oven up to temperature too fast. If the fibreglass dome starts to smoke at all, the burner is too high. Cut it back a little, and let the oven get up to temperature over about a 10-minute period. You start timing the baking as soon as the oven temperature reaches &#8216;B&#8217; of BAKE on the indicator. Don&#8217;t allow the temperature to go above the &#8216;E&#8217;; you could get scorching.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> These ovens are surprisingly fuel-efficient, but if you bake something every day, you&#8217;ll need to carry a bit more fuel than for non-baked alternatives. Yes, kayakers, you&#8217;ll need a bit of extra space to store the oven and ingredients, but not much. Our oven weighs 730g. Components fit inside the baking pan, which doubles as a covered frying pan.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Other than the oven and some fuel, you shouldn&#8217;t need to tote any extra equipment. Saucepans are fine as mixing bowls, coffee cups and teaspoons are precise enough for measuring any ingredients not pre-mixed at home, a wooden spoon for mixing and a rubber spatula for scraping the bowl. An upside down kayak makes a handy surface for rolling out piecrust, pizza dough, or cinnamon rolls.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Outback Oven Ultralight. 9.5 oz. $47.90.

To keep supplies light and nonperishable, use powdered milk and powdered eggs. Powdered eggs may be available in your local health foods store. Most recipes require shortening: cooking oil, margarine, or butter. Canola Gold is not quite as tasty as butter, but is all-purpose, designed to be stored at room temperature, and comes in a flip-top plastic bottle. At home, powdered eggs and shortening can be pre-blended with other recipe ingredients, but in damp conditions separately.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Outback Oven Mixes<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Just-add-water mixes, portioned to fit the Outback Oven, can be purchased from outfitting or sporting goods stores. Numerous entrees, breakfasts, breads, and desserts are available; popular choices include quiche, lasagna, pizza, apple pie, brownies, carrot cake, and scones. These mixes are easy and almost foolproof, and the quality is good. Convenience comes at a cost, though\u2014about $7 for a batch of fudge brownies, $11 for mushroom and olive pizza.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> <strong>Mixes from the Grocery Store<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Cakes, brownies, muffins, and quick breads are a good place to start, either on their own or dressed up. When assembling food for your trip, check the package directions and bring along any ingredients you will need to add to the mixes, such as powdered eggs, cooking oil, or powdered milk.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Cake. Before your trip, buy a pouch of cake mix (the size that makes a one-layer cake; often on sale for about 59 cents) and some goodies from the bulk foods section to put on top in lieu of icing. Some combinations we like are chocolate chips on top of chocolate cake, Smarties on yellow or white cake, and peanut butter cups on spice cake. At supper time, mix the cake mix with any required ingredients, and pour it into the greased baking pan. Sprinkle on the chocolate chips or other topping. Bake about 15 minutes.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Muffins. Buy muffin mix (the size that makes 8-12 muffins). Bring along some dried fruit or nuts or pick wild blueberries to add. Greased the baking pan. Bake about 15 minutes. Never mind that the package says &#8216;spoon into 12 muffin cups&#8217;; it works just fine as one big muffin.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> <strong>Advanced Baking<\/strong>: Recipes &#8220;From Scratch&#8221;<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Any of your favourite recipes will work in the Outback, although you may need to scale down the volume so that ingredients fit into a 10-inch pan. All that&#8217;s required is some advance preparation.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> The ultimate is pantry baking. Basic ingredients include: flour, nuts, powdered eggs, vanilla, salt, powdered milk, sugar, yeast, oil or margarine, baking powder. Other ideas: nuts, spices, cocoa powder, chocolate chips, raisins, extra chocolate, pizza toppings.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> <strong>Advanced Baking Tips.<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> <em>Modulating heat.<\/em> Start with a moderate flame as the scorch buster and baking pan get hot. Turn down as the thermometer enters BAKE zone, and lower till at top of BAKE zone. At end of baking time, turn of stove and cover pot parka with a towel, food will continue to bake using no additional fuel. The thicker the dough or batter, the more important it is to modulate heat for even doneness.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Save on <em>clean up<\/em> by mixing batters right in oven pan. A quick wipe cleans all.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> <em>Multi-baking sprees<\/em>. Have the next item mixed up and ready to go.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> <em>Browning<\/em>. To get foods browned on top, bake without the hood. With experience, you can tell if the heat is right by listening to the sound of the stove, appearance of the flame, and smell of food, so hopefully you don\u2019t need the lid and thermometer. It works best for bread and pizzas, etc. The pot parka rests directly on the food, so clean off the heat and cover with a towel or jacket. Repeat heat if needed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>OTHER METHODS OF BAKING<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> <strong>NOLS method<\/strong>. Stack rocks near stove at level of burner. Place covered pot on burner so \u00bc is over a low flame and \u00be is on the rocks. Every 2-3 minutes, give the pot a \u00bc turn so a new section is over the flame. Keep rotating till done. I\u2019m not sure how well this works. NOLS is the ultimate minimalist organization.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> <strong>Fire on top method<\/strong>. Make a pyramid shaped fire using palm-length sticks on the lid of the cooking pot and a stove on low under the whole thing. I think the only result will be a scorched lid.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> <strong>Dutch Oven<\/strong>.
