It is an Attempted World Heritage Site listed for its cultural ensemble.<br \/>\nClaiming to be Belgium\u2019s oldest city, it was a prosperous 2nd-century\u00a0Roman settlement on the Cologne-Bavay Roman road. By the 4<sup>th<\/sup> century, it had become one of the Low Countries\u2019 earliest Christian bishoprics, but in 1677, it was catastrophically torched by Louis XIV\u2019s French troops. Today it retains 8 sections of Roman walls and has a famous antique market on Sundays.<br \/>\n<strong>Grote Markt.<\/strong> The city\u2019s main square is lined by cafes.<br \/>\n<strong>Ambiorix Statue.<\/strong> In the Grote Markt, this large muscular statue venerates the local chieftain who led a brief 54BC revolt against Julius Caesar\u2019s Roman rule, losing 8000 men in the process. Ambiorix was largely forgotten by historians until the 1830s when Belgium was newly founded and in need of national heroes. The statue dates from 1866.<br \/>\n<strong>Onze Lieve Vrouwebasiliek.<\/strong> This large, mostly 14<sup>th<\/sup> to 16th-century\u00a0church dominates the Grote Markt, Tongerin\u2019s main square. The church marks the first place north of the Alps where the Virgin Mary is said to have been worshipped. Every seventh year in July, a venerated 1479 walnut Madonna statue is paraded around town in the large-scale but staid Kroningsfeesten procession. The basilica\u2019s rich treasury has artifacts dating back to the 6<sup>th<\/sup> century.<br \/>\n<strong>Gallo-Roman Museum.<\/strong> Besides and part of the church, this museum uses multimedia and thousands of artifacts to show the way of life at the time of Tongerin\u2019s Roman heyday.<br \/>\n<strong>National Park Hoge Kempen.<\/strong> This national park is a vast area of wild dense forest with farms and villages scattered through it. Google Maps took me to Lietsberg, a blocked entrance and the middle of a bare-foot walking path. There was a tower, Indian teepee, mud walk and it looked like a fun experience. The park is littered with towns as part of the below Industrial Transition Complex, an area of coal mining.<\/p>\n<p><strong>INDUSTRIAL TRANSITION COMPLEX \u2013 HOGE KEMPEN<br \/>\n<\/strong>Listed as a World Heritage Site, the Hoge Kempen Plateau is a mixed, evolutionary cultural landscape, making an entangled union. The geological formation of the subsoil &#8211; an underground coal layer and the lean, barren, gravel-rich sand at the surface, (this sizeable river sediment cone formed during the most recent Ice Ages &#8211; pebbles, gravel deposits, glacial ground profiles, dry valleys, and wind-borne sand deposits), mainly resulting in heathland, coniferous and ancient forests. There are very pronounced plateau edges due to the river Meuse cutting through its own sediment.<br \/>\nDue to human intervention since Neolithic times, inland heather vegetation developed on this sand, which was the basis for agriculture for centuries.<br \/>\nThe discovery of coal ensured that an entire industry developed employing people from all over Europe (1902 &#8211; 1980&#8217;s). These two land-based economic phenomena had an enormous architectural and social impact.<br \/>\nThe unique feature that the Hoge Kempen area is the transition from a rural to an industrial society, both visibly represented next to each other. It includes unique community expression of local, Southern, and Eastern European cultures as a result of 20th-century migration flows organized and\/or initiated by the mining industry.<br \/>\nThe Hoge Kempen area covers the following municipalities partly or as a whole: As, Dilsen-Stokkem, Genk, Lanaken, Maaseik, Maasmechelen, Opglabbeek and Zutendaal Several villages, town centres, hamlets and garden cities &#8211; the former colliers of Winterslag, Waterschei, Zwartberg and Eisden. These still retain their typical street patterns, plantation instructions, and architectural features. A selection of the buildings are listed as monuments. Belonging to the mining districts are the landmarks of the early 20th-century collieries: headgear and slag heaps (spoil tips). There are also former gravel and sand quarries currently being transformed into scenic nature areas.<br \/>\nAt the heart of the area lies Hoge Kempen National Park (5700 hectares) which is surrounded by more forests, heathland and scenic areas, village centers, and streams.<br \/>\nComparison with other similar properties. The World Heritage List was inspected looking specifically at cultural landscapes in Europe: glacial landscape formation, heather vegetation, artists, land use, mixed heritage, and mining history (with a focus on the last 3 benchmarks). Based on these elements, 10 were studied more in detail with regard to their similarities and differences: Cornwall &amp; West-Devon mining landscape (United Kingdom), Blaenavon industrial landscape (United Kingdom), Mont Perdu (France &amp; Spain), Saint Kilda (United Kingdom), South \u00d6land (Sweden), Rhine Valley (Germany), Hortob\u00e1gy (Hungary), Val d&#8217;Orcia (Italy), Portovenere &#8211; Cinque Terre (Italy) and the Madriu Valley (Andorra).<br \/>\nThere are few landscapes with industrial characteristics (only Cornwall and Blaenavon). The other landscapes are characterized by (pastoral) rural land use, and they tend to be located in mountain areas or focus on the wealthy local trading or cultural history (the Rhine Valley and Val d&#8217;Orcia). There are only two &#8220;mixed&#8221; cultural landscapes: Mont Perdu and Saint Kilda, which are not industrial landscapes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bokrijk Openlucht Museum.<\/strong> Outside of Genk, this open-air museum offers a look at Flanders\u2019 past with over 100 original old buildings reassembled here in 1958 and undergoing constant renovation since. It starts with a farming community with many animals and moves through a sixties recreation. Some of the signs have English but the few demonstrations were all in Flemish and some houses had no English. None show the origin of the original building, street signs are only in Flemish and it was hard to know where to go. I didn\u2019t enjoy this much \u2013 the inside of the homes was realistic but the outside looked like a theme park. The presence of many restaurants detracted from the recreated look. \u20ac12.50 concession + \u20ac5 for parking.<br \/>\n<strong>Limburg.<\/strong> In the NM small town series, I had a helluva time finding this town \u2013 does it exist?

Limburg is the name of the province in this part of East Flanders.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HASSELT<\/strong> (pop 75,000)<br \/>\nBelgium\u2019s unofficial gin capital has a gin festival on the 3<sup>rd<\/sup> weekend in October. The town\u2019s little barrel-carrying man dispenses gin briefly. This is a crazy place to drive with so many one-ways and pedestrianized streets, it was impossible. Parking was non-existent but I eventually got out and walked 10 minutes to the gin museum.<br \/>\n<strong>Nationaal Jenevermuseum.<\/strong> Housed in a restored, still active 19th-century distillery, it tells all there is known about gin.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Crematorium Hefheide.<\/strong> In the NM Modern Architecture series, it is about 45 km east of Brussels. I expected smokestacks but there were none. The crematorium runs west to east with a large parking area on the north side. The main crematorium is a windowless 20m wide X 110m long X 10m high windowless concrete block. There is a cladding of many 30cm X 6m rusted iron rectangles that are suspended about 3m outside the box of concrete. Each rectangle is angled differently to break up the fa\u00e7ade. Separated by a 6m walkway, at the east end is a second similarly spare concrete building about 20m wide X 35m long that contains a cafeteria and family rooms. The only windows are on the east end of the cafeteria which has a small area with tables and chairs outside. A driveway descends into the bowels of the structure at the west end. All the doors and parking signs are of the same rusted metal.<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.infosteel.be\/tools\/83-nederlands\/projecten\/elementen-in-staal\/579-crematorium-hofheide.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwi6hKfLkYrdAhUE_SwKHT0xB68QjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/www.infosteel.be\/images\/cca\/2014\/Crematorium-Hofheide\/staalbouw-construction-metallique-143.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Crematorium Hofheide\" width=\"656\" height=\"369\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/575686764854291504\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwjw_YvmkYrdAhUFhSwKHTvZA_IQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/bc\/1b\/cd\/bc1bcd6d999f5c9dd73270ccb6d4114c.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Crematorium Hofheide\" width=\"483\" height=\"386\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nThe building is surrounded by a lovely moat full of cattails, some water plants, little fish, and a few ducks. A small lake extends to the east of the outside seating area. Separating the parking area from the structure is a 10m wide row of mature trees.\u00a0\u00a0 On the south side is an orchard probably not part of the property and to the SE a large area of grass and newly planted trees.<br \/>\nIt was opened in 2014 with funding from the European Union and three local governments.<br \/>\nI love crematoriums as they are the only reasonable way to deal with dead people. It amazes me the amount of room devoted to cemeteries. In the mid-1800s, church graveyards were the main way Christians were buried, but they were very unsanitary, and most had run out of room. As a result, many large cemeteries were built outside cities all over Europe (Highgate outside of London is one of the most famous). Besides using valuable land, they are a waste of a coffin, embalming, maintenance of the cemetery, headstones, good clothes to dress the dead in \u2013 I could go on and on. And many headstones deteriorate so ones before 1850 are often hard to read. I do like the grave slabs that now adorn the walls of many a church. Some of the best are in the Orkney and in Li\u00e8ge Belgium.<br \/>\nAlthough many other religions bury their dead (Moslems, Jews), Christianity has a perverse love of cemetery burial \u2013 it is all about going to heaven with an intact body and living forever after. What a load of hooey. Paris had the best idea \u2013 when there was no more room in the cemeteries in the city, they dug them all up and put the bones in the catacombs. The Capuchins also had some interesting ideas: the monastery in Rome has great decorations using bones to make chandeliers and decorative wall \u201cornaments\u201d.<br \/>\nHindus burn their dead in wood pyres but it uses a lot of valuable wood and makes funerals in India quite expensive. The ghats in Varanasi and Katmandu are the best examples I have been to.<br \/>\nI have requested sky burial in my will. In Tibet, bodies are placed on pyres on the top of mountains to feed the vultures and rodents and the bones are then thrown in the river. I think this will present a problem for the executor of my will. Feeding wildlife seems eminently practical but I doubt if our governments agree.<br \/>\n<em>For some reason, I was the only one in the parking lot and had a lovely sleep in the peaceful rural setting. It was another hot day in Belgium. But the area is used a lot by locals: walkers, runners, and bikers.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00a0<\/em><strong>Vlooybeigtoren.<\/strong> This tower is an art installation accessed via a narrow gravel road, in the middle of a field \u2013 a staircase that climbs to a high panorama. Unfortunately, a recent fire and an explosion severely damaged some of the side panels. It was surrounded by a fence and tape was across the entrance.<br \/>\nThe Flemish Brabant municipality of\u00a0Tielt-Winge\u00a0-Belgium has been a place for people to enjoy a striking example of landscape architecture since May 2015. An eye-catching structure that blurs the distinction between a tower and a stairway floats high above the famous Kabouterbos (fairy tale forest) and draws the curiosity of many Tielt residents and passers-by. The intriguing volume of steel is clad in weathering steel from top to bottom.<br \/>\nThe story of the Tielt stairway tower goes back a long way. For many years, the hill to the west of the Vlooiberg was adorned by a wooden lookout tower about four meters in height. Aside from all the youth of Tielt, unfortunately, this tower also attracted vandals who irreparably damaged it by setting it on fire. The pride of\u00a0Tielt-Winge\u00a0had to be closed to the public for the sake of safety. Heated debates followed, and the municipality finally decided to replace the small wooden tower with a new, monumental object that would be able to withstand the ravages of time.<br \/>\nThe requirements in the specifications reflected this goal: the new tower was to be made completely out of metal, be at least ten meters high, including a shelter, and be resistant to any form of vandalism.<br \/>\nInstead of conventional construction with a spiral staircase, the designer conceived a suspended volume without too many decorative frills. The \u201cVlooybergtoren\u201d as it is called is 11.28 meters tall (the top platform comes out at 10.08 meters + 1.20-meter railing wall) and is built on a galvanized substructure that is clad in weathering steel, a subtle reference to the typical red-brown colour of the ironstone in the Hageland region. All in all, the imposing stairway tower weighs no less than thirteen tons.<br \/>\nIn the designer\u2019s own words, modelling the Vlooyberg Tower was \u201ca war against its own weight.\u201d To ensure that the structure would be strong enough and would not sag, he manually calculated the forces acting in each element. His findings gave the stairway tower its ultimate form and dimensions. The structure evolves from large, heavy and strong, to small, light, and slender. The railing wall functions as a structural beam that makes the steel structure strong and stable enough to withstand the forces acting on it. Two vibration dampers ensure that the stairway tower does not start to vibrate underfoot.<br \/>\nThe structure was fully prefabricated and assembled on-site section by section. In the end, it only took half a day to install. As a landmark with strong iconic value, the Vlooyberg Tower literally and figuratively raises the profile of the beautiful region around\u00a0Tielt-Winge.<br \/>\n<a class=\"js-image-size__link lazy-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/www.archdaily.com\/787423\/vlooyberg-tower-close-to-bone\/5735b040e58ece6f9e000114-vlooyberg-tower-close-to-bone-photo\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"b-lazy b-loaded\" src=\"https:\/\/images.adsttc.com\/media\/images\/5735\/b040\/e58e\/ce6f\/9e00\/0114\/newsletter\/_MG_5713_kopi%C3%ABren_kopi%C3%ABren.jpg?1463136294\" alt=\"\u00a9 Kris Van den Bosch \" longdesc=\"https:\/\/www.archdaily.com\/787423\/vlooyberg-tower-close-to-bone\/5735b040e58ece6f9e000114-vlooyberg-tower-close-to-bone-photo\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>LEUVEN<\/strong> (pop 98,000)<br \/>\nAn ancient capital, it is a prominent brewing capital (Stella Artois is still here) and Flanders&#8217; oldest university town with 25,000 students studying here now.s<br \/>\n<strong>Staduis.<\/strong> The city\u2019s most iconic site, this 15th-century architectural marvel is loaded with terraced turrets, fancy stonework, and colourful flags. 236 statues were added in the mid-19<sup>th<\/sup> century, each representing a prominent local scholar, artist, or noble from the city\u2019s history.

Christophe Plantin, a bookbinder and leather crafter from France, published his first book in 1555 and soon prominent writers and scientists were using his printing office, the <em>Officinia Plantiniana<\/em>. He was a shrewd businessman, maneuvering around religious and political conflicts. The publishing firm became multinational with branches in Frankfurt, Leiden, and Paris. In less than 20 years, Plantin&#8217;s publishing firm ranked among the top industry leaders. He was the founding father of nine generations of printers in Antwerp.<br \/>\nThe medieval building and 1622 courtyard alone would be worth a visit, but the world\u2019s oldest printing press, priceless manuscripts and books (some by Rubens and his brother illustrated by Pieter Paul), and original type sets (special letter types were used to prevent copying) add real flavour. Other highlights are the 1640 library, a bookshop dating from 1700, a valuable painting collection, tapestries, furniture, chandeliers, wood wainscoting, fireplaces, wrought iron fountains, and ancient leather \u201cwallpaper\u201d. It is purposely dimly lit \u2013 all the shutters are closed, curtains are drawn and lights dimmed to protect the colors in the displayed books (pages are turned every few months, and reproductions of the most valuable books are displayed). The place is a maze of rooms and stairways.<br \/>\nThe business made the southern Netherlands the crossroads of knowledge distribution as they published 55% of all the known scientific books \u2013 atlases and books on medicine, astronomy, mathematics, physics, and botany, many in several languages. The Bible was published in five languages \u2013 Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic, and Old Syrian. Antwerp was known as the international \u2018City of Books\u2019.<br \/>\n<strong>Onze-Lieve Vrouwekathedraal<\/strong>. One of Belgium\u2019s finest cathedrals, it was 169 years in the making (1352-1521). The 123m-high spire is visible from all over Antwerp. The interior is late baroque including four early Rubens canvases and while the KMSA is closed, some of that museum&#8217;s religious masterpieces. \u20ac4<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.robertharding.com\/index.php?lang=en&amp;page=search&amp;s=onze%2Blieve%2Bvrouwekathedraal&amp;smode=0&amp;zoom=1&amp;display=5&amp;sortby=1&amp;bgcolour=white\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwj2k6ze0ozdAhVJBywKHevUBK8QjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/images.robertharding.com\/preview\/RM\/RH\/VERTICAL\/832-162951.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Onze-Lieve Vrouwekathedraal\" width=\"257\" height=\"386\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<strong>DIVA \u2013 The House of Diamonds.<\/strong> In the back of a diamond retail store, the museum displays special works of art and has videos on cutting and polishing stones and jewelry making.<br \/>\n80% of the world\u2019s diamonds are traded in Antwerp in 4 exchange buildings along pedestrianized Hovenderstraat and Schopstraat. Though now Indian dominated, historically the business was mainly the domain of Orthodox Jews, whose black coats, broad-brimmed hats and long hair still remain a presence.<br \/>\n<strong>Het Steen.<\/strong> This is a small but photogenic castle dating from 1200 and occupying the original Gallo-Roman settlement (it is almost the only surviving part of the WHS Antwerp ramparts). There is nothing to see inside the castle and it was closed for renovation anyway. Outside is the humorous statue of Lange Wapper, a tall folkloric \u2018peeping Tom\u2019 figure showing off his codpiece to two tiny onlookers.<br \/>\n<strong>Sint-Paulusstraat.<\/strong> Don\u2019t miss this church with its fantastic Baroque interior. A former Dominican monastery (1256-1796), it had 1700 monks who were evicted by the French. It then reopened as the parish church in 1803. A 1968 fire destroyed the monastery but thankfully spared the church. The white interior is set off by the 5m wood panelling fronted by magnificent confessionals each with two saints and two angels fronting them. The choir has 8m wood walls. There was no room for the Ways of the Cross and the wonderful wood bas-reliefs are displayed in a separate chapel. The walls are a treasury of art.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazingbelgium.be\/2015\/10\/st-pauls-church-in-antwerp.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwiwj8380ozdAhXD1iwKHbaoCY8QjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-gwF4PdJlMBU\/VhAjnvWW5JI\/AAAAAAAA_qM\/CRL4hJCzLL8\/s1600\/Sint-Paulus%2Bkerk%2Bout.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Sint-Paulusstraat.\" width=\"515\" height=\"386\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Rockoxhuis.<\/strong> Nicolas Rockoxhuis was a 17th-century Antwerp celebrity: lawyer, city councillor, patron of the arts, and humanist intellectual.

Rescued from ruins in 1937, the building has an indulgent baroque portico, rear fa\u00e7ade and formal garden (much being restored and under scaffold when I was there). 14 Ruben canvases are displayed along with period pieces.<br \/>\n<strong>St-Carolus-Borromseuskerk<\/strong>.
