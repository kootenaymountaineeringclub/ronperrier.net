The wooden image of Christ, by an unknown artist, in a Renaissance-style representation of the\u00a0<i>Ecce Homo<\/i>, represents the episode of Jesus of Nazareth\u2019s life when the martyred religious figure was presented to the crowd following his whipping, and includes a crown of thorns, uncovered torso and bruised\/beaten body. Narrated in the New Testament, the artist represented in grande artistic style the contrast between violence on the body and the serenity of the expression, emphasized by the gaze from the image.<br \/>\nNormally, this statue and piece of art is on display in the Sanctuary of the Lord Holy Christ, in the Convent of Our Lady of Hope, but annually leads a procession through the streets of the city on the fifth Sunday after Easter, and terminating on the Thursday of Ascension.

I arrived 3 hours early, but met a nice couple from Denmark (originally from Latvia), so had lots to talk about. Upstairs in the ferry terminal was a lovely restaurant.<\/em><br \/>\n<em>They had arranged to climb Pico at night to arrive at sunrise.

Lava rock from ancient eruptions forms the walls of many homes and borders vineyards for the local wine, Verdelho. <em>I arrived by ferry at 20:20 but was not able to get a rental car or scooter (the Azores is very busy in the summer). I had befriended a Danish couple, but the car they reserved could not be rented as he had not had his driver&#8217;s license for 3 years. They found me needing someone and I ended up renting, driving and taking all the responsibility for accidents and tickets. I drove them to their accommodation on the west of the island, drove 30 km to the other side of the island, checked into my accommodation, tried to sleep for an hour and returned to their place at 00:30 to drive up to Mountain House to climb Pico.<br \/>\n<\/em><strong>Mount Pico\u00a0<\/strong>(2351m). This is perfectly cone-shaped and the third-highest peak in the Atlantic Ocean and highest in Portugal. Climbing this dormant volcano is the ultimate Azorean challenge.<br \/>\nAll climbers \u2013 with or without a guide \u2013 must check-in at Casa da Montanha at 1200m, the starting point for everyone. You are given a GPS and your location is tracked constantly. Fees in 2021 were 35\u20ac. It is a very steep hike with a wide range of hard rock and soil. Guides are suggested as they know the shortcuts, shelters in bad weather and best paths. Weather can be anything and change rapidly. Bring warm sweaters, jackets, gloves and toques.<br \/>\nStart early (6:30?). There are 47 numbered poles on the way to the peak \u2013 although after #44 you\u2019re already on the crater with a 70m summit scramble to a mini-mountain called Piquinho, which may be the hardest part. There are no trees but all kinds of different kinds of lava, craters, and formations. 8-9 hours.<br \/>\nFeel heat, and steam escaping between the rocks, the stones are hot, the air is hot. The 360-degree views of the Atlantic and the nearby islands of Faial and Sao Jorge. Views are not usually clear. The almost perfect cone of the volcano is topped by an almost perfectly round, 30m deep flat-bottom crater of ~550 m diameter. The floor of the crater has stone pits and shelters made by climbers to spend the night and see sunrise and sunset. Tents are mandatory if sleeping here.<br \/>\nSeveral companies offer night climbs starting at 01:30 to arrive on top for sunrise. Another major advantage is to avoid cloud and get a good view.<\/p>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<div id=\"page\">\n<div id=\"main-wrapper\" class=\"clearfix\">\n<div id=\"main\" class=\"clearfix\">\n<div id=\"content\" class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"section clearfix\">\n<div class=\"region region-content\">\n<div class=\"region region-content\">\n<div id=\"block-system-main\" class=\"block block-system\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"panel-flexible panels-flexible-2 clearfix\">\n<div class=\"panel-flexible-inside panels-flexible-2-inside\">\n<div class=\"panels-flexible-column panels-flexible-column-2-5 panels-flexible-column-first \">\n<div class=\"inside panels-flexible-column-inside panels-flexible-column-2-5-inside panels-flexible-column-inside-first\">\n<div class=\"panels-flexible-region panels-flexible-region-2-left panels-flexible-region-first panels-flexible-region-last left-content\">\n<div class=\"inside panels-flexible-region-inside panels-flexible-region-2-left-inside panels-flexible-region-inside-first panels-flexible-region-inside-last\">\n<div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-body\">\n<div class=\"pane-content\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden mCustomScrollbar _mCS_1\">\n<div id=\"mCSB_1\" class=\"mCustomScrollBox mCS-dark-thick\">\n<div class=\"mCSB_container\">\n<div class=\"field-items\">\n<div class=\"field-item even\">\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-11923\" src=\"https:\/\/www.portugalist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Piquinho.jpg\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.portugalist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Piquinho.jpg 2000w, https:\/\/www.portugalist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Piquinho-150x115.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.portugalist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Piquinho-300x229.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.portugalist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Piquinho-768x587.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.portugalist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Piquinho-1024x783.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.portugalist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Piquinho-735x562.jpg 735w\" alt=\"Piquinho\" width=\"618\" height=\"473\" \/><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/volcanohotspot.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/pi01.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-20846\" style=\"border-width: 0px; max-width: 100%; width: 618px; height: 422px;\" src=\"https:\/\/volcanohotspot.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/pi01.jpg?w=627&amp;h=428\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/volcanohotspot.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/pi01.jpg?w=627&amp;h=428 627w, https:\/\/volcanohotspot.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/pi01.jpg?w=150&amp;h=102 150w, https:\/\/volcanohotspot.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/pi01.jpg?w=300&amp;h=205 300w, https:\/\/volcanohotspot.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/pi01.jpg?w=768&amp;h=524 768w, https:\/\/volcanohotspot.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/pi01.jpg 1024w\" alt=\"Aerial view eastwards and into the crater of Mt.

I was able to join a night trip (Experience 2351, 60\u20ac, including mandatory GPS, headlight and hiking poles) starting at 01:30 to get to the summit for sunrise &#8211; and to avoid the inevitable cloud that covers the top most days. The 1151m (3726 ft) climb was at a nice grade and easy walking. Follow 47 numbered poles to the crater rim below Piquinho, the 70m climb at the end to the summit of the crater. It gradually became colder and very windy as I added a wool vest and then a wind jacket and gloves. Climbing Piquinho is a class 3 scramble, much through fumaroles venting. We were able to stay out of the wind for sunrise which was obscured by a distant cloud over Sao Jorge. I put on all my clothes and slowly warmed up as I had gotten very cold. After about 1.5 hours, we descended. Cloud blew in and it was very misty. At Mountain House, there was a dense downpour for 30 minutes.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nLandscape of the Pico Island Vineyard Culture.<\/strong>\u00a0World Heritage Site.

Pico Island is one of nine volcanic islands in the Azores with a long evidence of grape-growing and wine-making (viniculture), with an imposing pattern of orderly, long, linear walls running inland from, and parallel to, the rocky coastline around its northern and western edges. The stone walls form thousands of small, contiguous, rectangular plots built to protect crops from wind and salt spray. Vines were, and continue to be, planted within the small and soilless plots (locally called\u00a0<em>currais<\/em>). The extensive system of small fields, as well as the buildings (manor houses, wine cellars, warehouses, conventional houses, and churches), pathways and wells, ports and ramps, were produced by generations of farmers enabling the production of wine.<br \/>\nBegun in the 15th century, wine production on Pico Island reached its peak in the 19th century and then gradually declined due to plant disease and desertification (loss of soil and reduced rainfall). However, a low level of grapevine growing and high-quality wine production continues to be undertaken and expanded, especially around the village of Cria\u00e7\u00e3o Velha, just a few kilometres south of Madalena. Wine production is managed under a regime designed to ensure economic viability and sustainability as well as to retain traditional farming techniques.<br \/>\nAbandoned, stone-walled enclosures suffer from a low level of deterioration resulting from disuse and neglect, while certain invasive plant species have colonized many of -these abandoned <em>currais<\/em>.<br \/>\n<em>This covers a large area north of Madalena. There is an amazing number of tiny plots surrounded by walls. Vines grow but don&#8217;t appear tended.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>The Whaling Industry Museum<\/strong>\u00a0details the historic transition of Pico from a whaling station to a renowned place to see whales in the wild.\u00a0The museum is in three old houses where the whalers used to keep their boats and an old blacksmith\u2019s forge, a set of buildings dating from the 19th century that still preserve many of their original features.<br \/>\nAlso on display is a collection of the tools and equipment used in whale hunting, as well as scrimshaw &#8211; carved and engraved pieces made from the bones and teeth of whales.<\/p>\n<p><em>I caught the plane at 19:00 (1.5 hours late) to return to Ponta Delgada.
