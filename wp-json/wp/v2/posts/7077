There is a hikeable ridge about 10 km long joining the major peaks from Naumulten in the north to Hilda in the south. In 2003, the Glasheen family built a backcountry lodge on the west slope of Naumulten, which made the logistics of doing this hike easier. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">At 1:00 pm, Aug 11, eleven of us met in Burton at the winter staging area for Valkyr Adventures. After meeting Martin Glasheen and his son Ryan, we were driven for about 45 minutes up Stony FSR to a trailhead for the hike into their lodge. This hike took about 2 \u00bd hours at a leisurely pace through scenic, mostly alpine terrain. At this point, the trip made a radical departure from normal KMC fare. We were greeted at the lodge by Shelly Glasheen and shown our rooms, complete with sheets and towels (for the hot shower). Then hors d\u2019oeuvres were served, after which people relaxed in the lodge, hiked close by or played bocce. Supper got full marks for both quality and quantity, and shortly after (encouraged by the looming 5:00 am wake-up call), people started heading for bed. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">We left the lodge at 6:00 am the next morning, and, fueled by Shelly\u2019s granola and eggs, most of us made it up the 900\u2019 to Naumulten peak (8118\u2019) by 6:45. From there it was an easy 3 km ridge walk (which included losing and then gaining 500\u2019 elevation) to the summit of Rollins. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The next stage was the 2 km ridge to McBride (8300\u2019). This involved a 300\u2019 descent and a 500\u2019 ascent with a 200\u2019 bump in the middle. Occasional light scrambling was required, and the final ascent was a bit steep and exposed. Two participants decided to avoid this ascent by going into the bowl to go around the east peak of McBride about 500\u2019 below the summit and contouring around to join us on the ridge leading to Prough. While in the bowl, they decided they would rather regain the ridge between the two peaks of McBride via a muddy, rock-strewn gully. All this took time and had me more than a little nervous. This leg made it evident to me that there was a significant disparity in pace among our group. By the time everyone had assembled on the ridge just south of McBride, around noon, the speedy ones had been waiting 2.5 hours and had even enjoyed a nap. Because of our slow pace and the uncertain weather (cool, cloudy, the odd snowflake and afternoon showers in the forecast), I decided that the keen and well-rested hikers (3 volunteered) should continue with our original route on the ridge system to Prough and Hilda. At the same time, the rest of us would descend into Hilda&#8217;s bowl. Group splitting was possible because I was in radio contact with our subgroup (as well as the Glasheen family). <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The speedy three summited Prough and then Hilda (8600\u2019) by 2:30, an awe-inspiring accomplishment considering the scrambling and effort involved. Congratulations, Jen, Shannon and Caroline! <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">On their way down to the pickup point on Tait FSR, they met Ryan Glasheen, who, after summiting Hilda himself, drove them back to the staging area, via a 2-hour stop in Fauquier, where they corrected their hamburger and beer deficiencies. Meanwhile, back in Hilda basin, our group\u2019s revised plan to get to the Tait FSR pick-up point by skirting the east flank of Hilda at about 7000\u2019 and then contouring around to the south (thus avoiding the time-consuming and exposed ridge route to the summit) was revised again. In the interests of time (getting slower) and safety (starting to rain), we decided to descend in a NE direction to the Burton Creek FSR, where Martin agreed to pick us up (thank goodness for radios). Fortunately, Rudy was very familiar with this route as the trail was intermittent. We made it to the FSR by 5:00 and then had to walk 3-4 km to the vehicle as the road was washed out at km 15. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">By 7:00, we were back at our vehicles in Burton and met the other 3 group members who had just arrived from Fauquier. Everyone agreed that it was an interesting and enjoyable day, although, as is often the case with large groups and ambitious agendas, it didn\u2019t go quite according to plan. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Thanks to the following participants: Caroline Dahlen, Rudy Goerzen, Graham Jamin, Jen Kyler, Caroline LaFace, Kate Murphy, Shannon Naylor, Diane Paolini, Jill Watson, and Mary Woodward. Special thanks to the Glasheen family, Martin, Shelly and Ryan, for setting a new standard in hospitality and service. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Bill Sones<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Part of the Valkyr Range, this group of mountains extends for 11 kilometres in a north-south line to the west of Burton Creek.
