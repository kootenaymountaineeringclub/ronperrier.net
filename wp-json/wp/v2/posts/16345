Both had expertise in lung disease, and right away they knew COVID-19 was unusual. The two were especially concerned about reports of a \u201csilent hypoxia\u201d that left COVID-19 patients awake but caused their blood oxygen levels to plummet.<br \/>\nAckermann and Jonigk suspected that SARS-CoV-2 was somehow attacking the lungs\u2019 blood vessels. As the disease spread through Germany in March 2020, the duo began conducting autopsies of COVID-19 victims. They soon tested their blood-vessel hypothesis by injecting tissue samples with resin and then dissolving the tissues in acid, which left behind faithful casts of the original vasculature.<br \/>\nUsing this technique, Ackermann and Jonigk compared the tissues of people who hadn\u2019t died of COVID-19 with those who had. They immediately saw that among COVID-19 victims, the smallest blood vessels in the lungs were distorted and reshaped. These landmark results,\u00a0published online in May 2020, showed that COVID-19 wasn\u2019t strictly a respiratory disease but a vascular one\u2014one that could affect organs across the entire body.<br \/>\n\u201cIf you go through the human body and you take all the blood vessels in one line, you come up with [60,000] to 70,000 miles, double the distance around the Equator,\u201d says Ackermann, who is also a pathologist at Wuppertal, Germany\u2019s HELIO Clinics. If just one percent of these blood vessels gets attacked by a virus, he adds, the blood\u2019s flow and ability to absorb oxygen can be impaired, with potentially devastating consequences across entire organs.<br \/>\nAs soon as they recognized COVID-19\u2019s vascular effects, Jonigk and Ackermann realized that they needed a much better view of the damage.<br \/>\nMedical x-rays such as CT scans can provide a view of an entire organ, but they weren\u2019t high-resolution enough. Biopsies can let scientists study tissue samples under a microscope, but the resulting images are only small bits of a whole organ and can\u2019t show how COVID-19 progresses across an entire lung. And the team\u2019s resin technique required dissolving tissue, which destroys the sample and limits further study.<br \/>\n\u201cAt the end of the day, [the] lung is oxygen in, carbon dioxide out\u2014but for that, it has thousands and thousands of miles of blood vessels and capillaries that are so finely and nicely arranged \u2026 it\u2019s almost a miracle,\u201d says Jonigk, the founding principal investigator of the German Center of Lung Research. \u201cSo how could we actually assess something as complex as COVID-19 \u2026 without destroying the organ?\u201d<br \/>\nJonigk and Ackermann needed the unprecedented: a series of x-rays, all done on the same organ, that would let researchers zoom into portions of the organ down to the cellular scale. In March 2020, the German duo reached out to a longtime collaborator of theirs, Peter Lee, a materials scientist and chair of emerging technologies at UCL. Lee\u2018s specialty is studying biological materials with powerful x-rays\u2014so his mind immediately went to the French Alps.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\" data-bumper-index=\"10\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/b40550a6-0b09-4fea-a98e-caec44cc2ba3\/MM9847-_211214_0691.jpg?w=1280&amp;h=854\" alt=\"A brain conserved in the biomedical sample preparation lab, where donated human organs are stored for research purposes part of Human Organ ATLAS.\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">A donated brain undergoes conservation in the ESRF\u2019s biomedical sample preparation lab, where the Human Organ Atlas\u2019s donated human organs are stored for research purposes.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop InlineVideo\" aria-label=\"Video\" data-bumper-index=\"12\">\n<div class=\"SingleVideo\">\n<div data-meta-id=\"Brain-Video\">\n<div class=\"NatGeoVideoPlayer NatGeoVideoPlayer--videoPlaying aspect-ratio--parent aspect-ratio--16x9 VideoPlayer\">\n<div class=\"VideoPlayer--placeholder absolute-fill\">\n<div class=\"MediaPlaceholder relative MediaPlaceholder--16x9 cursor-pointer height-contain\" tabindex=\"-1\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent MediaPlaceholder__Image\">\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper aspect-ratio--child\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/c6c5f1dd-3cbe-4f9c-ab3e-2748f9345b14\/0000017e-8d19-d562-ab7e-edf985bb0000_16x9.jpg?w=1280&amp;h=720\" alt=\"\" aria-hidden=\"true\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<div class=\"LoadAnimation LoadAnimation--darkBG LoadAnimation--md\"><span class=\"RichText\">This video shows a 3D reconstruction of the complete brain of a 69-year-old female donor.

The facility is a particle accelerator that makes electrons travel at nearly the speed of light around\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.esrf.fr\/home\/UsersAndScience\/Accelerators\/parameters.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a half-mile-long circular track<\/a>. As these electrons careen round and round, powerful magnets along the track bend the particle stream, which causes the electrons to emit the world\u2019s brightest x-rays.<br \/>\nThis powerful radiation lets the ESRF peer into objects at the scale of micrometers, even nanometers. It is frequently used to study materials such as alloys and composites, check the molecular structures of proteins, and even reconstruct ancient fossils without having to separate rock from bone. Ackermann, Jonigk, and Lee wanted to use this huge instrument to perform the world\u2019s most detailed x-ray scans of a human organ.<br \/>\nEnter Tafforeau, whose work at the ESRF has stretched the limits of what synchrotron scans can see. His impressive bag of tricks previously let scientists peer inside dinosaur eggs and virtually unwrap mummies, and almost immediately, Tafforeau confirmed that the synchrotron could, in theory, make a good scan of an entire lung lobe. But actually scanning a whole human organ posed a grand challenge.<br \/>\nFor one, there\u2019s the issue of contrast. Standard x-rays make images based on how much radiation gets absorbed by different materials, with heavier elements absorbing more than lighter ones. Soft tissues are mostly made of light elements\u2014carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and so on\u2014which is why they don\u2019t show up clearly in a classic medical x-ray.<br \/>\nOne of the ESRF\u2019s great benefits is that its x-ray beams are very coherent: Light moves in waves, and in the ESRF\u2019s case, its x-rays all start out with the same frequency and alignment, undulating in unison like the marks left behind by a zen garden\u2019s rake. But as these x-rays move through an object, subtle differences in density can cause each x-ray\u2019s path to deviate slightly, a difference that gets more detectable the farther the x-rays propagate once they exit the object. These deviations can reveal the slight density differences within an object, even if it is made of light elements.<br \/>\nBut stability is another challenge. To pull off a series of zoomed-in x-rays, a given organ would have to be immobilized in its natural shape so it wouldn\u2019t flex and shift by more than a thousandth of a millimeter. Any more wiggle than that, and successive x-ray scans on the same organ wouldn\u2019t align with each other. Needless to say, though, organs can be quite floppy.<br \/>\nLee and his team at UCL rushed to devise containers that could withstand the synchrotron\u2019s x-rays but also let through as many waves as possible. Lee also juggled the project\u2019s overall organization\u2014such as the finer points of shipping human organs between Germany and France\u2014and recruited Walsh, who specializes in huge biomedical datasets, to help work out how to analyze the scans. Back in France, Tafforeau\u2019s jobs included refining the scanning procedure and figuring out how to keep the organs still within the containers that Lee\u2019s team was building.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\" data-bumper-index=\"15\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/2b5c1e62-02f1-45e2-b87d-e285508f2d5d\/MM9847_211214_0891.jpg?w=1280&amp;h=854\" alt=\"The hearth of the ESRF, the synchrotron.

As May turned to June, he had prepared and scanned the left lung lobe of a 54-year-old man who had died from COVID-19, which Ackermann and Jonigk had shipped to Grenoble from Germany.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">\u201cWhen I saw the first image, the email I sent to all the people on the project was, I apologize: We failed, I was not able to have high-quality scans,\u201d he says. \u201cI just sent them two pictures that, for me, were bad, but for them were excellent.\u201d<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">For UCL\u2019s Lee, the images were awe-inspiring: an organ-wide view like a standard medical CT scan, but \u201cwith one million times the information.\u201d It was as if the researchers had spent their lives studying a forest by either flying over it in a jumbo jet or hiking along one trail. Now they were soaring just above the forest canopy, like birds on the wing.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">\u201cThe first time we saw the middle resolution \u2026 It was just like, silence,\u201d Walsh says.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Tackling future challenges<\/h2>\n<p>The team published\u00a0its first full description of the HiP-CT method\u00a0in November 2021, and the researchers also have published a detailed look\u00a0at how COVID-19 affects certain kinds of blood circulation in the lungs.<br \/>\nThe scans also yielded an unanticipated bonus: helping the researchers convince friends and relatives to get vaccinated. In severe COVID-19 cases, many of the lungs\u2019 blood vessels look dilated and bloated, and at smaller scales, abnormal bundles of tiny blood vessels form.<br \/>\n\u201cWhen you see the structure of lungs of people who die from COVID, it does not look like lungs\u2014it\u2019s a big mess,\u201d Tafforeau says.<br \/>\nEven in healthy organs, he adds, the scans were revealing subtle anatomical features that had never been documented because nobody has ever seen a human organ in this level of detail before. With more than a million dollars in funding from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative\u2014a nonprofit founded by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and physician Priscilla Chan, Zuckerberg\u2019s wife\u2014the HiP-CT team is now creating what it\u2019s calling\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/human-organ-atlas.esrf.eu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Human Organ Atlas<\/a>.<br \/>\nSo far, the group has released scans of five types of organs\u2014the heart, brain, kidneys, lungs, and spleen\u2014based on donated organs from Ackermann and Jonigk\u2019s COVID-19 autopsies in Germany and healthy \u201ccontrol\u201d organs from LADAF, a Grenoble-based anatomy lab. The team has made the data,\u00a0as well as fly-through movies based on the data, freely available online.<br \/>\nThe Human Organ Atlas is rapidly growing: Another 30 organs have already been scanned, and 80 more are in various stages of preparation. Lee says that some 40 different research groups have contacted the team to learn more about the method.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\" data-bumper-index=\"20\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/0a6c2ab5-db0c-4983-aeb2-853b1146560d\/KidneyLADAF2020-27_3D_glow.jpg?w=1280&amp;h=1127\" alt=\"Image at 25.08um performed by HiP-CT of the left kidney from a 94 year old female donor.\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">This HiP-CT scan depicts the left kidney of a 94-year-old female donor, down to a resolution of 25.08 micrometers.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><span class=\"RichText Caption__Credit\" aria-label=\"Image by ESRF, Human Organ Atlas\">IMAGE BY ESRF, HUMAN ORGAN ATLAS<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"InsertedAd\" data-bumper-index=\"21\">\n<div class=\"ad-wrapper\" tabindex=\"-1\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n<div data-box-type=\"fitt-adbox-article_dynamic\">\n<div id=\"ad-slot-article_dynamic-420975\" class=\"Ad article_dynamic article_dynamic ad-slot Ad--hasLabel\" data-slot-type=\"article_dynamic\" data-collapse-before-load=\"true\" data-slot-kvps=\"pos=article_dynamic\" data-label=\"advertisement\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\" data-bumper-index=\"22\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/e7c0e6e1-8e33-422c-8220-d35dd889050e\/LADAF-2020-31_kidney.jpg?w=1280&amp;h=680\" alt=\"Image at 25.08um performed by HiP-CT of the left kidney from a 94 year old female donor.\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">Thanks to HiP-CT, researchers can trace the complex vascular system of the 94-year-old\u2019s kidney at high resolution.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Cook, the UCL heart specialist, see enormous potential in using HiP-CT to understand basic anatomy. And Joe Jacob, a UCL radiologist who specializes in lung disease, says that HiP-CT will be \u201cinvaluable for understanding diseases,\u201d especially in 3D structures such as blood vessels.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Even artists are joining the fray. Barney Steel, of the London-based experiential art collective Marshmallow Laser Feast, says that he is actively researching how to explore HiP-CT data in immersive virtual reality. \u201cWe\u2019re basically creating journeys through the human body,\u201d he says.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">But for all HiP-CT\u2019s promise, there are also considerable challenges. First, Walsh says, HiP-CT scans generate a \u201cterrifying amount of data,\u201d easily several terabytes per organ. For clinicians to make real-world use of these scans, the researchers hope to develop a cloud-based interface to navigate them, like Google Maps for the human body.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">They also need to turn the scans into workable 3D models with greater ease. Like all CT scanning techniques, HiP-CT works by making many 2D slices of a given object and stacking them together. Even today, much of this process is manual, especially for scans of abnormal or diseased tissues. Lee and Walsh say that a major priority for the HiP-CT team is to develop machine-learning techniques that can lighten the load.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">These challenges will scale as the Human Organ Atlas expands\u2014and as researchers\u2019 ambitions grow with it. The HiP-CT team is using the ESRF\u2019s newest beam facility, called BM18, to continue scanning the project\u2019s organs. BM18 produces a much bigger x-ray beam, which means scans take less time, and BM18\u2019s x-ray detector can be placed up to 125 feet (38 meters) away from the object being scanned, which makes its scans far sharper. The BM18 results are already so good, Tafforeau says, that he has re-scanned some of the Human Organ Atlas\u2019s original samples on the new system.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">BM18 also has the space to scan very large objects. Thanks to the new facility, the team\u2019s vision is to scan an entire torso of a human body in one fell swoop by the end of 2023.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">In exploring this technique\u2019s immense potential, Tafforeau says, \u201cwe are really at the very beginning.\u201d<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/article>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>World\u2019s brightest x-rays reveal COVID-19\u2019s damage to the body A new scanning technique delivers exquisitely detailed images\u2014and could revolutionize the study of human anatomy.
