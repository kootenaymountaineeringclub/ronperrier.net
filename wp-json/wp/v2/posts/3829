World Heritage listed, it attracts pilgrims from all over the world. Initially home to hundreds of monasteries, it was abandoned by 400 AD. Since 1978, Buddhist countries have constructed extravagant monasteries spread over a huge area requiring a bicycle to see it. There are wide roads and many reflecting ponds.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The Maya Devi Temple sits on the exact site of Buddha\u2019s birth. The temple area is reached by a long causeway across a lake that appears to surround the temple like an island. It is a plain low white brick building.

Victor was a Buddhist monk for a couple of decades and I think is one of the great unsung philosophers of our time. He states that Buddha was born in Iran and never saw India.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>INDIA<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>SARNATH<\/strong>, the site of Buddha&#8217;s first sermon is another of the big four Buddha sites. It is 13 km north of Varanasi. After Buddhism declined in the 7th century, it was rediscovered by the English in 1835. There is a 34m stupa, Ashoka Pillar, excavated monastery ruins, a museum (with the well-preserved, 3rd-century lion capital from the Ashoka pillar which is the national emblem of India and on all their money), and a modern temple with a cutting planted in 1931 from the original bodhi tree under which Buddha attained enlightenment (obtained from Sri Lanka).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><br \/>\n<strong>BODHGAYA<\/strong>, another of the 4 great Buddha centres, is where Buddha reached enlightenment. A prince, at 29, he lived in a cave just outside Bodhgaya for 6 years without drinking water or consuming food!!! Not surprisingly, he was extremely thin and was returned to health by a woman who fed him rice milk pudding. He then went and sat under the bodhi tree, attained enlightenment and became Buddha. Like Lumbini in Nepal, most Buddhist countries have built monasteries in their national style. It is a major pilgrimage site on the tourist trail with souvenir shops and all that goes with it.<br \/>\n<strong>Mahabodhi Temple<\/strong> is UNESCO World Heritage-listed where he attained enlightenment and formulated his philosophy of life. It was built in the 6th century AD atop a previous Buddhist temple built in the 3rd century BC by Ashoka. Destroyed in the 11th century and restored many times, the last restoration was in 1882. Topped by an impressive 50m carved pyramidal tower, it holds a 2m high gilded seated Buddha. Behind the temple is a huge bodhi tree raised from a cutting from the original tree that was somehow growing in Sri Lanka.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Every Buddhist country has built large monasteries here, as in Lumbini, all with their architectural styles, but these are all close together and easy to see. The ones I especially enjoyed were Tibet, Bhutan (amazing exterior and interior with all the walls carved in bas-relief and painted in bright colours), Japan (understated elegance) and Thailand (spectacular roof lines and a gold Buddha). The other great highlight was the 25m tall Great Buddha statue on a 10m pedestal that towers over everything. It is surrounded by 10 smaller statues of Buddha\u2019s disciples. The statue is hollow and contains 20,000 bronze Buddhas.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Mountain Temple, <\/strong>just outside Bodhaya, has the cave where Buddha fasted. The statue was skeletal, and the small cave was atmospheric. I came out here with a guy on a motorcycle. It was a great tour touring through the rural areas.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><br \/>\nBUDDHA SMRITI PAR, <\/strong>Patna, Bihar was inaugurated by the Dalai Lama in 2010.

This is the home in exile for The Black Hat sect of Buddhism. The last (16th) leader of the sect died in 1993 and has not been replaced because there are two rival candidates. The Rumtek gompa is a rambling walled complex and is unusually guarded by armed police as there have been many violent altercations by monks who dispute the accession. There is a main monastery building and a Golden Stupa holding the ashes of the last leader. The Old Rumtek Gompa is a 1.5km walk away and sits in an idyllic setting on a west-facing ridge. The interior is a riot of colour.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><br \/>\nRAVANGLA<\/strong>\u00a0has a new giant 41m tall Buddha statue.

The town was a backwater until 1960 when the Dalai Lama claimed asylum here following the 1951 Chinese invasion of Tibet. The <strong>Tsuglagkhang Complex<\/strong> is the main focus of pilgrims, monks and tourists. The temple is the exiles\u2019 equivalent of the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa. The two temples are surrounded by the gompa, where one can watch monks debate. Points of argument are sealed with a foot stomp and theatrical clap of the hands. Just inside the entry gate is the Tibet Museum, telling the story of the Chinese occupation and the subsequent Tibetan exodus. The town also has many Tibetan government and cultural buildings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>SRI LANKA<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic,<\/strong> Kandy, houses Sri Lanka\u2019s most sacred Buddhist relic \u2013 a tooth of the Buddha. It was snatched from the flames of the Buddha\u2019s funeral pyre in 483 BC and smuggled in the hair of a princess to Sri Lanka in the 4th century AD, ending up in Kandy in 1283. Stolen by the Indian army, retrieved by the Ceylonese, stolen and burnt by the Portuguese (turned out to be a fake tooth), it finally returned to Kandy and the Temple was finished in 1782. Sri Lankan Buddhists believe they must make one pilgrimage here in a lifetime to improve one&#8217;s karma and the temple is a busy place. However, one does not see the tooth. It\u2019s kept in a gold casket shaped like a dagoba (stupa), which contains a series of six dagoba caskets of diminishing size. The stupa casket is viewed from a doorway 3m away and the queue is kept moving so one only gets a brief glimpse inside the shrine room. Behind the main shrine sits a large hall with dozens of sitting Buddhas and a series of pictures depicting the life of the tooth. Behind this whole complex is the World Buddhism Museum showing Buddhism around the world.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><br \/>\nADAM&#8217;S PEAK<\/strong> (2247m) is a lofty peak that has been a focus for pilgrimage for over 1000 years. It is named after the place where Adam first set foot on earth after being cast out of heaven, or Sri Pada (Sacred Footprint, left by Buddha as he headed towards paradise). In the pilgrimage season from December to May, the 7km of cement stairs to the top are illuminated at night with refreshment stands. Most start the 2-3 hour walk around 3 am up the 5200 steps to reach the top before sunrise. You pass a World Peace Pagoda near the beginning. There is a temple at the top with a giant Buddha foot as the idol.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><br \/>\n<strong>DAMBULLA ROYAL ROCK TEMPLES<\/strong> are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Carved into the face of a big cliff, the five caves contain about 150 Buddha statues dating from the first century BC to more modern times. The entire inside \u2013 walls and ceilings- are spectacularly painted with geometric designs and Buddha scenes. The colours are still vivid. Cave 1 has a 15 m-long reclining Buddha that is beautifully carved. Cave 2 is arguably the most spectacular, measuring 52m long by 23m deep with a 7m high ceiling. Besides at least 50 Buddhas (the main one is under an archway decorated with dragons and has the right hand raised in a pose conveying protection), there are two statues of the kings who had the cave built. Hindu deities are also represented. A vessel sits under a constant drip from the roof, even during droughts, and the water is used during rituals. Cave 3 is filled with Buddha statues, including a beautiful reclining Buddha. Cave 4\u2019s central Buddha sits under a decorative arch, and his hands are in a meditative pose in which the hands are cupped. Cave 5 features a reclining Buddha and Hindu gods. Try to come when there are no crowds, especially tour groups, whose constant chatter ruins the peaceful ambiance.<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" nofocus\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https:\/\/www.indoasia-tours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Dambulla-Cave-Temple.jpg\" alt=\"Dambulla Cave Temple\" width=\"622\" height=\"492\" aria-label=\"Dambulla Cave Temple\" data-bm=\"7\" \/><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>The Golden Temple<\/strong> is a modern, kitschy building behind the square at the bottom of the complex, completed in 2000 using Japanese donations.

Geologically, Sigirlya is a hardened magma plug of an extinct volcano that long ago eroded. Peppered with natural cave shelters, rock overhangs and numerous hand-hewn additions, the rock and surrounding area were developed during the reign of King Kasapa (477-495 AD) who built a royal palace on top.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The monastery complex was abandoned in the 14th century, and \u2018rediscovered\u2019 by the British in 1898. It was declared a World Heritage Site in 1982. The theory is that the top was always a Buddhist monastery. The 370m ascent is on marble stairways and constructed metal boardwalks scaling the sheer cliff. Halfway up is a metal stairway that leads to a sheltered gallery of fresco paintings of buxom, wasp-waisted women. Protected by a big overhang, the paintings are in remarkable condition with glowing colours. All that remains today of the palaces or monastery, depending on the theory, are foundations, a carved platform, and a 27x21m square water tank.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" role=\"button\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/unusualplaces.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/Sigiriya1.jpg?fit=917,1024&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Visiting Sigiriya rock fortress in Sri Lanka.

The great Bodhi tree is central to Anuradhapura in both a spiritual and physical sense. The huge tree grew from a seedling brought from Bodhgaya in India by the sister of Mahinda, who introduced the Buddha\u2019s teaching to Sri Lanka. Surprisingly, the present bodhi tree in Bodhgaya was grown from a cutting of this tree. The sacred bodhi tree is the oldest historically authenticated tree in the world: it has been tended by an uninterrupted succession of guardians for over 2000 years, even during periods of Indian occupation (the oldest trees in the world, however, are the bristlecone pines of the White Mountains of eastern California, the oldest of which are documented to be 4,600 years old).<br \/>\nThere are several bodhi trees here, the oldest and holiest stands on the top platform surrounded by a golden railing. Thousands come to make offerings, especially in December and April. A temple stands on the east side and the whole complex is surrounded by an ancient stone wall.<br \/>\nThe <strong>Brazen Palace<\/strong> ruins are close to the Bodhi tree. All that remains of this once huge palace are 1,600, ten-foot-high, square stone columns of a building thought to be nine stories high and home to 1000 monks. First constructed 2000 years ago, it was rebuilt many times, the last in the 12th century. The columns stand behind a fence. Nearby is an abandoned monastery with a huge stone trough that could hold enough rice to feed 3000 monks.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0<strong>Ruvanvelisaya Dagoba<\/strong>, originally built in 140 BC, and rebuilt many times, is a huge 55m high, dazzlingly white, bulbous-shaped stupa. The wall at the base has a frieze of hundreds of large elephants standing shoulder to shoulder.<br \/>\nJust north, the <strong>Thuparama Dagoba<\/strong> dates from the 3rd century BC and is the oldest in SL and maybe the world. Stupas are solid, have no entrances or interiors, and exist only for their exteriors.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The rest of the sites visited are away from the Mahavihara area and scattered next to the Tissa Wewa, a large lake. From the 2nd century BC, the\u00a0<strong>Mirisavatiya <\/strong><strong>Dagoba<\/strong>\u00a0is big and white.\u00a0<strong>Isurumuniya Vihara<\/strong>, also 2nd century, is a rock temple with a small museum containing a sculpture of the \u2018lovers\u2019.\u00a0<strong>Vessagiriya<\/strong>\u00a0is the remains of a cave monastery complex.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Jetavanarama Area.<\/strong>\u00a0The\u00a0<strong>Jetavanarama Dagoba<\/strong> was built in the 3rd century, and once stood over 100m high (then the 3rd highest monument in the world, the first two being the Egyptian Pyramids), but today is about 70m. It is covered in dark brown bricks \u2013 it has been calculated that there were enough bricks in the dagoba to make a 3m-high wall stretching from London to Edinburgh. Behind the dagoba is a monastery that housed 3,000 monks. One building has door jambs over 8m high still standing. At one time, massive doors opened to reveal a large Buddha image. On the other side of the road is a 42 m x 34 m stone wall enclosure built to imitate a log wall. The building is long gone. The museum associated with this site has a carved urinal and beautiful jewelry, carvings and pottery.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Abhayagiri Monastery Area. <\/strong>This is spread out over a huge forest with scattered ruins everywhere. The 75m tall <strong>Abhayagiri Dagoba<\/strong> was created in the 1st and 2nd centuries BC and was the centrepiece of a huge monastery for 5000 monks. Chinese traveller Faxian visited in 412 AD. It, too, is all brick and has some interesting bas-reliefs. A ruined 9th-century school for monks has the finest carved <strong>Moonstone<\/strong>\u00a0in SL. A moonstone is a semicircular carved rock on the ground at the entrance to a building. It was decorated with carved lions, elephants, horses, and geese. The fine steps feature plump little figures.\u00a0<strong>Ratnaprasada<\/strong> has the finest guardstones in Anuradhapura, featuring a cobra being swallowed by a dragon. The\u00a0<strong>Samadhi Buddha<\/strong> is a 4th-century seated statue in a seated pose and is regarded as one of the finest Buddha statues in SL. <strong>Kuttam Pokuna <\/strong>or the twin ponds, are two swimming pool-like bathing tanks. Water entered through the mouth of a mythical multispecies beast and was filtered and drained through both tanks. There is a nice five-headed cobra carving. <strong>Abhayagiri Museum<\/strong> has a collection of toilets, urinals, jewelry, and religious sculptures.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Citadel Area. <\/strong>This newer area has few remains of a Royal Palace, plus an enormous trough filled with rice for the monks. The temple was the first Temple of the Tooth, which originally came to Sri Lanka in 313 AD.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><br \/>\n<strong>POLONNARUWA<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The ruins are divided into 5 groups. The <strong>Archaeological Museum<\/strong> is excellent, but I arrived at the same time as 300 pilgrims walking from Colombo to the north of Sri Lanka. In this heat and humidity, they looked beat and very sweaty. I could understand the many monks in the group but wondered about the Westerners as they trooped in single file through the museum, too tired to look at anything. Several of them were bagged out on the floor. The ruins are spread out along a very long road, spaced in a big forest.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Royal Palace Group. <\/strong>The Royal Palace was big, 31x13m, and 7 stories high with the top 4 stories of wood. Now, a few of the brick and rubble walls remain with little detail. The Audience Hall had a frieze of elephants, each in a different position. Two monitor lizards were fighting in a nearby mud hole.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Quadrangle Group. <\/strong>A Circular Relic House had an 18m diameter terrace with a central dagoba and 4 entrances flanked by fine guardstones and the best moonstones in the whole site. The Thuparama Gediga is a hollow Buddhist temple with an intact roof. The Gal Pota is a 9\u00d71.5m, 66cm thick hunk of rock weighing 25 tons with an inscription extolling the king&#8217;s virtues. It was dragged 100km to this site. The Hatadage is a tooth relic chamber. The Satmahal Prasads consist of 7 decreasing stories shaped like a small pyramid. There are several other small buildings.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Northern Group. <\/strong>I was thankful for the bike as things got spread at the end of the road. One passes a few Hindu temples, all with a Shiva linga. Rankot Vihara is a 54m high dagoba, the largest in Polonnaruwa and the 4th largest on the island. Like most other dagobas, it is an earth-filled dome covered by a brick mantle.<br \/>\nThe Buddha Seema Prasada is the monastery abbot\u2019s convocation hall. The Lankathilaka has 17m high walls with a collapsed roof and a huge standing headless Buddha. The Kiri Vihara is a medium-sized dagoba whose overgrown jungle was cleared away after 700 years of neglect. The original lime plaster was in perfect condition, and it is the best-preserved dagoba in the entire site.<br \/>\nI saved the best for last, as the <strong>Gal Vihara<\/strong> is a group of beautiful Buddha statues that mark the high point of Sinhalese rock carving. There are four statues all cut from the same piece of cream-colored granite with dark grey streaking. All are in perfect condition. The standing Buddha is 7m tall and has unusually crossed arms and a sorrowful facial expression. The 14 m-long reclining Buddha has a subtle depression in the pillow under his head and a wonderful wheel symbol on the pillow end. The other two statues are seated Buddhas. One is surrounded by a background of carved temples and an arch. These are the highlights of Polonnaruwa. There are two other small groups of buildings I did not bother with.<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" nofocus\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https:\/\/th.bing.com\/th\/id\/R.eadbffdcaded96f3954a61bd561635d3?rik=6lCV31L6rCZ1bA&amp;riu=http%3a%2f%2fmysrilankaholidays.com%2fgallery%2fgal-vihara-5.jpg&amp;ehk=hFP7P46xJsQ0b6C31s%2brR%2b3xAw9Whm4OWV%2f582mGuX0%3d&amp;risl=&amp;pid=ImgRaw&amp;r=0&amp;sres=1&amp;sresct=1\" alt=\"Gal Vihara (or Viharaya) rock temple at the Ancient City of Polonnaruwa ...\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" aria-label=\"Gal Vihara (or Viharaya) rock temple at the Ancient City of Polonnaruwa ...\" data-bm=\"6\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>BHUTAN<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Tango University of Buddhism<\/strong>. In 1619, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal came to Bhutan. Called the architect, he was responsible for building most of the monasteries and dzhongs (fortresses) still standing in Bhutan today. He built this monastery in 1620 as an institute for monks. It has the same function today, and monks commit 3 years, 3 months and 3 days to study. The 45-minute walk up to the monastery is through an oak forest. Buddhist sayings pepper the trail. Gorgeous langur monkeys with black faces, white heads and chests, a grey body and long prehensile tails were scrambling and fighting in the trees. On the drive here, we had passed a stream with several small &#8220;houses&#8221; perched over it. I was impressed with what appeared to be a run-of-the-river hydroelectric project. However, the only things being turned were prayer wheels. The courtyard of the Astrology Monastery had two enormous cypress trees, now rarely seen in nature. A virtual look-alike to our western red cedar, these were as big as our largest. I counted 17 dogs snoozing, preparing for their night of mayhem.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The <strong>Thimphu Zoo<\/strong> holds a few deer and the takin, the national animal. Several years ago, the king decreed that it was improper for a Buddhist nation to keep an animal in captivity. The animals were set free, and the zoo closed, but the takin refused to leave the area. They were soon roaming the streets of town. The present minimalist preserve was then built. The takin is unrelated to any other animal and has an unusual appearance &#8211; the head of a goat and the body of a cow.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>The National Memorial Chorten<\/strong> memorializes the third king, the father of modern Bhutan. Carrying the message of world peace and prosperity, it has a classical stupa shape, but with rooms inside, wall paintings and statues. Many elderly people were sitting with their prayer beads or circumambulating the stupa.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><br \/>\nBUDDHA POINT,<\/strong> at 167&#8242; tall, is the tallest sitting Buddha in the world. It sits high above Thimphu, giving panoramic views of the valley and city. Made of bronze and studded with semi-precious stones, Bhutan cannot cast the large pieces. They were manufactured in China and then assembled here. A temple was built in the base but the large plaza in front was still under construction in 2013.<br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" nofocus\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7418\/12572535534_17d4807824_b.jpg\" alt=\"Bhutan_0039_m | Buddha Dordenma (or Buddha Point) \u2013 I believ\u2026 | Flickr\" width=\"620\" height=\"398\" aria-label=\"Bhutan_0039_m | Buddha Dordenma (or Buddha Point) \u2013 I believ\u2026 | Flickr\" data-bm=\"7\" \/><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><br \/>\nPUNAKHA VALLEY\u00a0<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>The Divine Mad Man&#8217;s Temple<\/strong> was built in 1499 on a hillock in the center of the valley. He used humour, songs, and sometimes bizarre and shocking behaviour with deep sexual overtones to dramatize his teachings. The temple has several wooden phalluses brought from Tibet by the lama. Penises complete with testicles are painted on most commercial buildings and carved phalluses are for sale everywhere. One store is called Phallus Handicrafts. Pilgrims receive a blessing to ward off evil by being struck on the head with a ten-inch wooden phallus. It is believed that childless couples who pray here will be blessed with children, and women visiting from all over the world. This is the only temple where alcohol is seen on altars &#8211; the Divine Madman liked his booze. The temple is accessed by a lovely 20-minute walk across rice paddies. Small groups of teenage monks were practicing playing the musical instruments that are part of Buddhist rituals.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><br \/>\nTHE PUNAKHA Dzong <\/strong>was built in 1638 by the architect at the confluence of the Mo Chhu and Po Chhu Rivers at the exact spot prophesied by the founder of Bhutanese Buddhism, Guru Rinpoche, 800 years previously. It is easily the most impressive building and dzong in Bhutan. Tall white stone walls enclose two huge rectangular towers. One showcases all of Bhutan&#8217;s art forms. Elaborate worked gold metal surrounds the many columns. Intricate paintings of the story of Buddha cover every wall, and embroidered cloth hangings adorn everything. I watched a monk do a butter sculpture. With 8 mounds of differently coloured butter, he applied it using his thumb to construct intricate flowers. This dzhong served as the capital of Bhutan until 1955 and is still the winter residence of the central monastic body, the ruling organization of the Drukpa Kagyu School of Buddhism.<br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" nofocus\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-LTU3XWxNWt0\/X1cutDIdgtI\/AAAAAAAAAJU\/HvvF7NGMgAI_IryqRNYbj0MpvZ-X6R6wgCLcBGAsYHQ\/s1095\/1393303802_PunakhaDzong-1095x665.jpg\" alt=\"PUNAKHA DZONG - The oldest and historic dzong of Bhutan\" width=\"622\" height=\"377\" aria-label=\"PUNAKHA DZONG - The oldest and historic dzong of Bhutan\" data-bm=\"6\" \/><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><br \/>\nKhamsum Yulley Namhyal Chorten<\/strong> or &#8220;Queens Chorten&#8221;. It took 9 years to build and was finished in 2004 by the mother of the present king. Sitting high above the valley, there are commanding views in all directions. The temple is considered one of the finest examples of the use of traditional Bhutanese architectural style in modern times. The inside has 4 levels adorned in the best architectural style. It is impossible to describe the wood carving and fantastically painted interiors. Each has statues of all the important people in Bhutan\u2019s Buddhist culture &#8211; Guru Rinpoche, the Architect and the pantheon of Buddhist gods. Every altar has bowls of holy water filled before sunrise and emptied after sunset daily. Lotus blossoms float in the water. Butter lanterns give a musky scent to the air. Donations of food and money compete with butter sculptures and candle-driven prayer wheels. Ancient elephant tusks flank the altar. On the roof, we enjoyed the stupendous views.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Talo<\/strong>, the hometown of the present queen, has an 8-foot wide road paved since her marriage. We visited an ancient monastery with all the usual over-the-top interiors. Here, the 400-year-old paintings were directly on the concrete but in good condition. Four young monks were playing darts, and they let me join them. It took several attempts to get my range (50m is a long throw), but I still never got very close. On the way down, we visited a nunnery, one of three in the country. Small groups of tonsured women sat on the grass practicing their prayers and chants. They were a much more serious group than any male monks. The monastery was as fantastic as all the others. An imposing statue of Chenrizig, the 11-headed, thousand-armed god of compassion, was the main deity. Anybody who says Buddhism is a philosophy, not a religion, has not seen this religion in action.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><br \/>\nTiger&#8217;s NEST<\/strong> is the iconic and most famous Bhutan tourist site. It has been listed as one of the ten holiest places in the world. It is called the Tiger&#8217;s Nest as Guru Rimpoche is said to have flown to the site on the back of a tigress, and the monastery was built in 1692. Fire damaged the monasteries in 1951 and 1998, after which a major reconstruction was undertaken. After a 30-minute drive north of Paro, we joined the throngs starting the hike. Horses are available for rent. Supposedly a 900m elevation gain, it is probably more like 600m. It took me 1 1\/2 hours at my slow, steady pace, and I lost count after passing the 100th person. This was a physical test for most. Prayer flags are everywhere in Bhutan, but the numbers here were over the top. Some spanned impossible distances. The high point of the trail is reached at a viewpoint, where both the valley below and the monastery perched on a ledge on a vertical granite wall. There are at least 10 other monasteries dotted across the cliff above the one at Tiger&#8217;s Nest. The location is spectacular. One descends many steps built on the cliff to the base of a stunning waterfall, and then a tiring ascent to the monastery. I was frisked for the first time in Bhutan. The monastery is a series of seven or so small temples, each with its gods and statues. I had beaten all the people and was alone in most of them. I wandered through them for over 50 minutes and then the crowds arrived.<\/span><a class=\"YsLeY\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"link\" href=\"https:\/\/tobinka.com\/bhutan-tigers-nest\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-ved=\"0CBQQjRxqFwoTCOjrrY3czo0DFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE\" aria-label=\"Visit tobinka\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"sFlh5c FyHeAf iPVvYb\" src=\"https:\/\/tobinka.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/8_bhutan_dsc_10483_country-image.jpg\" alt=\"The best of Bhutan: Tiger's Nest Monastery and Punakha Dzong | tobinka\" width=\"623\" height=\"414\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Jowo Temple of Kyichu<\/strong> is the oldest existing temple in Bhutan, built in the 7th century.

Large stone lions flank the large stairways leading up to a raised platform on which the gold stupa sits. The stairways are usually lined with vendors. Temples line the outer walls of the platform, usually with many Buddha images. Altars are simple with flowers, holy water and sometimes fruit. Flashing neon lights are behind Buddha\u2019s head. There is no pantheon of gods \u2013 only one, Buddha. The interiors of the temples are simple, often painted gold. Dioramas with statues of monks or disciples are frequent. The roof lines, however, are ornate with multiple tiers and gold crests. Most stupas have corners for the eight days of the week. The stupas are always painted gold and have ornate metal cones on top. There are no entrances into the stupa proper \u2013 they are solid. People walk clockwise or counterclockwise, it doesn\u2019t seem to matter. There are no prayer wheels or prayer flags. Just as everywhere else, people pray with prayer beads of 108 beads and keep up a droning chant.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Male monks wear maroon, and female nuns wear pink. They enter the monastery as little children, often from families with too many children to support. Up at five, they make the rounds of the village or city with their large bowls, begging for food from the members of the town. They do not eat after noon. They seem very worldly \u2013 have smartphones, ride in taxis and shop in stores. The internet cafe I used in Mandalay always had at least 10 teenage monks using Skype, Gmail, and playing video games. They receive a normal education and sometimes college degrees and Ph.D.s. Foreign teachers said they were normal, mischievous boys, but also keen students.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nSULE PAYA<\/strong> is a 2,000-year-old Buddhist temple occupying the largest traffic circle in Yangon \u2013 the \u2018gold\u2019 stupa is a landmark. The Myanmar style of Buddhist architecture (like most countries) is unique, with plain interiors and a heavy emphasis on gilding.

Shwedagon is said to be built on a hill where Buddha relics have been enshrined, including eight hairs of Buddha. The zedi is 98m tall and over the years has accumulated 53 metric tons of gold leaf. The top of the spire is encrusted with over 5000 diamonds and 2000 other stones.<br \/>\nWe went in the evening by taxi for 2000 kyat. Though there are elevators, I would encourage you to walk up one of the huge, graceful stairways (one for each direction). The stupa is surrounded by eight \u2018corners\u2019, one for each day of the week plus one extra. Using the day of the week they were born, one pours cups of holy water over a Buddha image, one for each year of their age plus one extra. One could spend 3 hours exploring all the temples, large bells, several gigantic bodhi trees, and Jade Buddha, or simply sitting around soaking in the ambiance.<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" nofocus\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tripsavvy.com\/thmb\/7S1z1otmxDdPPtQEzLyaqGFQAE0=\/4938x3292\/filters:fill(auto,1)\/shwedagon-pagoda-yangon-5a0e73e44e4f7d0036a76931.jpg\" alt=\"Shwedagon Pagoda: Planning Your Trip\" width=\"622\" height=\"415\" aria-label=\"Shwedagon Pagoda: Planning Your Trip\" data-bm=\"13\" \/><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><br \/>\nManhangar Pagoda, <\/strong>Inle was originally built in 1313.

Walking along a river with a big weir, you end up climbing up a big covered stair to the top with a large temple, surrounded, at last count, by 1,054 stupas. The original stupa, built in 270 BC, is encased in the present pagoda. The oldest stupas are crumbling brick, but many are modern and all sizes.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><br \/>\nMANDALAY<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Mahamuni Paya<\/strong> is a temple with a 4 m-tall Buddha image seized from Rakhine State in 1784. Cast as early as the first century, its story of transportation by boat and land is told by wonderful paintings in one of the rooms. It is so venerated that it is washed and its teeth brushed every morning at 4 am by a team of monks (many tourists attend). It is now covered by 15cm of gold leaf, applied by hundreds every day. The upper part of the statue can\u2019t be reached to apply gold but the arms have disappeared under it. Women are not allowed on the platform. In the NW corner of the compound is a room holding several large bronze statues originally from Angkor Wat in Cambodia, taken as booty from a war with Thailand, lost and then recaptured again in 1599. One is a three-headed elephant, there are two 8-foot-tall warriors and two lions. Legend has it that touching parts of the statues that you may be having health problems with will cure you. As a result, the patina is well-worn, and holes have formed in the noses and other parts.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Sagaing<\/strong> is the ancient capital of the Sagaing Dynasty (1315-1364). There are 500 stupas and monasteries covering the hilltops above the river. After a 30-minute climb, I reached the top of Sagaing Hill and the monastery with outstanding views of Mandalay, the river and all the surroundings. Gold stupas poke above the trees everywhere.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Mingun<\/strong> is home to a trio of unique pagodas. We reached it north of Sagaing in a half an hour. The\u00a0<em>Mingun Paya<\/em>is are the remains of a planned 150m tall stupa, a candidate for the world\u2019s largest pile of bricks (thought to be a billion as the huge structure is entirely brick with no earth fill). Before the earthquake on 11\/11\/2011, it was possible to climb to the top. The <em>Mingun Bell<\/em> holds the record for the world\u2019s largest uncracked bell (one-third the size of a bell in Moscow and 14x the size of the bell in St Paul\u2019s Cathedral). Casted in 1865, it weighs 90 tons and is 16.3 feet wide at the bottom and 12 feet high. 200m north is the white, wavy terraced\u00a0<em>Hsinbyume Paya<\/em>. The remnants of two huge lions are across the street from the Paya.

Most visitors here rent a horse and cart to make the three-hour tour of all the ruins. Several small stupas dot the roadsides; one has an old Buddha image. The finest site is an enormous 1834 teak monastery.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong> Three Temples<\/strong>. Rarely seen by tourists, the site consists of three similar 40-meter square solid brick structures built in the 13th century, each with four arched entrances leading to a room with large sitting Buddha images. The images are unusual in that they have closed eyes and downcast heads. Some faint remnants of murals remain and the images have original paint. The most northerly two temples are in significant disrepair, but the other has been restored. Passageways connect the four rooms and stairways lead to the roof overgrown with trees.

Despite centuries of looting, neglect, erosion, earthquakes and dodgy restoration, the temple-studded plain remains impressive. In a 230-year building frenzy ending in 1287 and the Mongol invasions, Bagan\u2019s kings commissioned over 4000 Buddhist temples. Many restoration projects have resulted in a compromised archaeological site that can barely be described as ruined. It has attained Unesco World Heritage status since my visit, It remains a wonder. The best temples give a sense of what the place was like at its zenith, while others conceal colourful murals and hidden stairways that lead to exterior platforms and jaw-dropping views across the plain.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">We rented bicycles and visited many small temples lining the river and the walled city of Old Bagan. On the North Plain, Ananda Pahto, built in 1105, is probably Bagan\u2019s top draw. Here and in many other temples, the murals retain their bright colours. Shwesandaw Paya is a steep white pyramid with 360-degree views of all the temples and was packed for sunset. Several temples have interior interconnecting passageways and steep, narrow stairways taking you onto the roofs.

There are 51,000 ancient statues, 254 carved niches, and 45 caves, of which #9, 10 and 40-45 were closed. Amazingly, they still retain their gorgeous pigment. Some are fronted with wooden temples, some contain intricately carved wooden pagodas, and others have central carved stone pagodas. Frescos of Buddhist scenes, animals, birds and angels, some still brightly painted, are abundant. Eight caves contain enormous Buddha statues, the largest is seated and 17 m high. Some of the caves are three levels high, and the big Buddhas stare out of windows cut into the rock. Some of the carvings are exquisite, including many 1000 Buddha walls and a 30-scene depiction of Buddha\u2019s life. Unfortunately, there is some graffiti, weathering and removal of heads.

Inside the body, hidden from view, is a water drainage system to prevent weathering. He is showing his age, and soil erosion is an ongoing problem. To appreciate his magnitude, get an up-close look at his head, then descend the steep, winding stairway for the Lilliputian view. Avoid weekends and holidays, as crowds on the stairway bring the pace to a standstill. I was first at the ticket booth and first at the Grand Buddha.

The most amazing was at the very top with gruesome depictions of torture and evil.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><br \/>\nSHIBAUZHAI PAGODA <\/strong>This is a 12-story, red, wooden pagoda, 56m high, built and leaning against a big chunk of rock. The bottom nine stories were originally built during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) and the top three stories above the height of rock were added in 1956. The stairs inside the pagoda pass by steles and statues of deities and generals. Architecturally unique, it has round windows and is built without nails. The duck well proved that the well was connected with the river after a duck was put down the well and appeared in the river. The rice flowing well provided free rice until a greedy monk enlarged the hole, stopping the flow of rice forever,r proving that greed doesn\u2019t pay. The views from the temple on top are panoramic. Since the dam was built, the climb is now 175m less than originally, and the rock and pagoda are now an island reached by a swaying suspension bridge called the \u2018drunken bridge\u2019.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><br \/>\nLUSHAN <\/strong>One of the great early monastic centers of Chinese civilization, the dramatic fog-enshrouded cliffs of Lushan have attracted monastics and thinkers for 1500 years. The monk Hui Yuan, one of the first Chinese teachers to promote meditation, founded Pure Land Buddhism here in the 4th century. Tao Yuanming, a contemporary, was China\u2019s first landscape poet.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><br \/>\nTIAN TAN BUDDHA STATUE<\/strong>, Hong Kong. At 26m, this is the world\u2019s tallest seated Buddha (this is what they say, but Buddha Point in Bhutan is significantly larger at 50m). Take the metro to Tung Chung and then the cable car. This must be the longest cable car in the world as it makes two turns and goes over a mountain and is relatively expensive at HK$180. It was a 2-hour wait to get onto the cable car as I went in the early afternoon, so I went early to beat the crowds. Walk through a lot of souvenir shops to get to the base of the Buddha, then a long stair to the statue. If I had not collected all things Buddha, this may have not been worth it. Consider taking the tram up and then walking down (2-3 hours).<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"nofocus alignleft\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/22\/95\/5b\/22955b17584bad04caf7729507174a5d.jpg\" alt=\"Tian Tan Buddha The statue is named Tian Tan Buddha because its base is ...\" width=\"620\" height=\"413\" aria-label=\"Tian Tan Buddha The statue is named Tian Tan Buddha because its base is ...\" data-bm=\"12\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><br \/>\n<strong>MAIJI SI<\/strong><strong>.<\/strong> 35 miles SE of Tianshui is \u201cHaystack Mountain\u201d whose cliffs are riddled with niches and statues carved from AD 389-581. On my quest to see everything Buddha in the world, I am glad I did not miss this one. The 221 caves and 1000 statues on the vertical cliff face are accessed by catwalks and stairways cross-crossing the cliff. Most of the statues are made of clay with elaborate clothing and detailed painting. Six large statues, the biggest at 15.7m, adorn the cliff outside of the caves. How all this was carved remains a mystery \u2013 it is thought that they worked on piles of wood blocks.

Because of its inaccessibility,\u00a0this was one of the few Buddhist grottos to have survived the 20th century unscathed. Over 1600 years, workers dangled from ropes to carve 183 niches and sculptures in the sandstone of the steep canyon walls. The stars of the site are the 27m high, seated statue of Maitreya, the future Buddha, and a 9m reclining Buddha. But much of the rest of the carving is exquisite and a lot of the paint is still bright. Just below the grottos, the canyon ends at the reservoir on the Yellow River, hemmed in by a ring of dramatic rock pinnacles.<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" nofocus\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https:\/\/th.bing.com\/th\/id\/R.a34019c1b5cc52386a59c6faefff8d03?rik=sFXYqpu8YIA3Rw&amp;riu=http%3a%2f%2fsilkroadshow.cn%2frelicsimgs%2f2020%2f11%2f29%2f%e7%82%b3%e7%81%b5%e5%af%ba.jpg&amp;ehk=tkDzKKPDjToz96E47yoAw8QXXNL6eN0M9vMmzhokBAQ%3d&amp;risl=&amp;pid=ImgRaw&amp;r=0\" alt=\"\u70b3\u7075\u5bfa\u77f3\u7a9f - \u56fd\u5bb6\u827a\u672f\u57fa\u91d1\u8d44\u52a9\u9879\u76ee-\u4e1d\u7ef8\u4e4b\u8def\u4e2d\u56fd\u6bb5\u4e16\u754c\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7\u6570\u5b57\u5c55\u793a\u4e0e\u4ea4\u6d41\u5e73\u53f0\" width=\"621\" height=\"405\" aria-label=\"\u70b3\u7075\u5bfa\u77f3\u7a9f - \u56fd\u5bb6\u827a\u672f\u57fa\u91d1\u8d44\u52a9\u9879\u76ee-\u4e1d\u7ef8\u4e4b\u8def\u4e2d\u56fd\u6bb5\u4e16\u754c\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7\u6570\u5b57\u5c55\u793a\u4e0e\u4ea4\u6d41\u5e73\u53f0\" \/><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">There are two ways to get there \u2013 a one-hour boat ride ($17) or a taxi, highly recommended because of the spectacular scenery. We climbed high above Liujiaxia through terraces laddering every inch of tillable ground on the barren, dry hillsides. Potatoes and corn are the main crops. Looking down, there was an impossibly steep, narrow, rutted dirt track descending into the rugged canyon below. To my surprise, that was the route to the grottos. The landscape was stunning with erosional features, pinnacles and rock towers. The ideal trip would be to take the boat one way and a taxi the other, but I doubt this is logistically possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>LABRANG MONASTERY,<\/strong>\u00a0Xiahe. This monastic town attracts many tourists. Most are rural Tibetans, here to pray and seek spiritual fulfillment. The Xiahe area was once part of Tibet. Labrang Monastery was founded in 1709 by the first generation of a line of living Buddhas ranking third in importance after the Dalai Lama and Panchen lamas. Labrang is one of the six major Tibetan monasteries of the Yellow Hat sect of Tibetan Buddhism (the others are Danden, Sera and Drepung monasteries near Lhasa, Tashihunpo Monastery in Shigatse and Kumbum near Xining, Qinghai). At its peak, it housed 4000 monks, but the number greatly declined during the Cultural Revolution (called the anti-feudal revolution). Numbers are recovering and are currently restricted to 1800 monks, drawn from Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan and Inner Mongolia.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Access to most of the monastery is free, and you can spend hours walking around and soaking up the atmosphere in the endless maze of mud-packed walls. One of the best experiences is to show up between 6 and 7 am for the monk\u2019s morning prayers. Walking the <em>kora<\/em>is is one of the highlights. This 3km path encircles the monastery and is the best way to grasp the layout, scale and significance of the monastery. Lined with long rows of squeaking prayer wheels, whitewashed chortens (Tibetan stupas) and chapels (many closed), most of the pilgrims on the kora appeared to be Tibetan with darker skin, traditional dress and a different facial appearance. Most were old, and some amazingly frail. Beggars were frequent. The 3-story <span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Barkhang\u00a0<\/span><\/em><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">is<\/span><\/span>\u00a0the traditional printing press with 20,000 wood blocks used for printing. The\u00a0<em>Gongtang Chorten<\/em>\u00a0has access to the roof for views over the entire monastery. Tibetan monasteries are almost equal to the ones in Bhutan for opulent decoration: brilliantly painted frescoes, embroidery and carving.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Besides the kora, several main buildings require a tour: the Institute of Medicine, Manjushri Temple, Golden Temple, Prayer Hall, and a museum of relics and yak butter carvings.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Great Buddha Temple<\/strong>. Originally dating to 1098, this huge temple contains a 35 m-long sleeping Buddha \u2013 the largest clay-covered, wood-core Buddha in China (I guess this is a big deal). Until the 1960s, children could play inside the tummy of the Buddha. The main hall is one of the few wooden structures from this era still standing. The doors and woodwork are exquisite.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><br \/>\nMOGAO CAVES<\/strong>, Dunhuang. A Unesco World Heritage Site, these are one of the greatest repositories of Buddhist art in the world. First started in 368 AD, the site at its peak had 18 monasteries, more than 1600 monks and nuns, and countless artists, translators and calligraphers. Wealthy traders and important officials were the primary donors responsible for creating new caves, as caravans detoured to Mogao to pray and give thanks for a safe journey through the treacherous wastelands to the west. They were largely forgotten from 1300 until the 20th century, when they were \u201crediscovered\u201d by many foreign archaeologists from 13 countries who visited and took priceless items (especially the 20,000+ manuscripts found in the library cave).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Mogao is 10 km east of town near the railway station and is most cheaply visited on one of the free city buses. In busy seasons, it is recommended to reserve tours as this is an incredibly popular place. It is also expensive, like most good sites in China \u2013 220 yuan ($38). One starts with two excellent films (make sure to get the English headsets), one shown in a theatre with a huge round screen on the ceiling (think planetarium). You then get a free English-speaking guide,e and I had her all to myself. The in-season tour includes 6 of the 492 caves (20 are rotated regularly) but they are all spectacular.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><em>Northern Wei, Western Wei and Northern Zhou Caves<\/em>. These earliest caves are distinctly Indian in style and iconography, with central pillars representing a stupa, and slim statues with finely chiselled features. Lead-based paint, initially white, is oxidized to black. <em>Sui Caves <\/em>(581-618) still have Indian features. The 230\u00a0<em>Tang Caves <\/em>(618-907) were the high point as the Tang pushed China\u2019s borders westward into Kazakhstan bringing diverse trade. The murals are still beautiful with the paint, especially on the ceilings, is remarkable. There are also two big Buddhas, one 26m tall and one 34.5m tall \u2013 a Maitreya Buddha, making it the world\u2019s third largest Buddha. The post-Tang Caves introduced Tibetan influences. The Library Cave (#17) was discovered in 1900 (the room was completely disguised) with tens of thousands of immaculately preserved manuscripts dating to 406, texts of rare Central Asian languages, military reports, music scores, medical prescriptions, Confucian and Taoist classics, Buddhist sutras and the oldest printed book in existence, the Diamond Sutra (AD 868). Almost all were removed to the West. An excellent museum is outside the cave, telling the whole story.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Another good museum worth visiting is the Research Centre, where 8 caves are meticulously reproduced.<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" nofocus\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/c1\/98\/59\/c198598160039f920d99254eb71e29ab.jpg\" alt=\"Mogao Caves - Wikipedia | Dunhuang, Dream destinations, Buddha\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" aria-label=\"Mogao Caves - Wikipedia | Dunhuang, Dream destinations, Buddha\" data-bm=\"6\" \/><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" nofocus\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https:\/\/th.bing.com\/th\/id\/R.3c682c15fb293d4dbe5b69b556fb96a4?rik=fS%2bzLPwMm%2bClVw&amp;riu=http%3a%2f%2f3.bp.blogspot.com%2f-bTfelZms4Iw%2fVCizySt9jfI%2fAAAAAAAAaZ0%2fbDUCFgVW3pM%2fs1600%2fIMG_0635BCorp.jpg&amp;ehk=rI78bHxsDWGMjADAzoCjLwxzLFP332ikXCZNBwvwlq8%3d&amp;risl=&amp;pid=ImgRaw&amp;r=0\" alt=\"James Photography: Mogao Caves, Dunhuang, Gansu, China\" width=\"620\" height=\"413\" aria-label=\"James Photography: Mogao Caves, Dunhuang, Gansu, China\" data-bm=\"6\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"mainImageViewer\">\n<div id=\"mainImageWindow\" data-m=\"{&quot;mid&quot;:&quot;033C01D39A268B1EC61A03DD8C350E259B3A565C&quot;,&quot;purl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.pinterest.com\/pin\/509751251568172653\/&quot;,&quot;murl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/c1\/98\/59\/c198598160039f920d99254eb71e29ab.jpg&quot;,&quot;turl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/tse4.mm.bing.net\/th?id=OIP.Q99ypg_4u-_de5fPVNQqDwHaFj&amp;pid=Api&quot;}\">\n<div class=\"mainImage wide notbkg current curimgonview\" role=\"main\">\n<div class=\"richImage \">\n<div class=\"mainContainer \">\n<div class=\"imgContainer\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>TIBET<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>LHASA.<\/strong>\u00a0Lhasa is the traditional, political and spiritual center of the Tibetan world.<br \/>\n<strong>BARKHOR.<\/strong> It\u2019s difficult not to be swept up in the tide of humanity that is Barkhor, a kora or pilgrim circuit that winds clockwise around the Jokhang Temple. The crowd of pilgrims is captivating &#8211; they come from all over Tibet. White ovens belch the smoke of incense burning. The most impressive were two men prostrating themselves every few meters, wood and metal sliders on their hands.<br \/>\nJakhang Temple (85\u00a5). This 1300-year-old, Unesco-rated temple is the spiritual heart of Tibet with the continuous movement of pilgrims prostrating themselves outside. The golden roof lines foretell the ancient interior with frescoed walls and carved pillars. The central golden Buddha here is the most revered in all of Tibet.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nPOTALA PALACE<\/strong>. Once the seat of the Tibetan government and the winter residence of the Dalai Lama, it is Lhasa\u2019s cardinal landmark. The first sight of the towering maroon, yellow and white fortress-like walls will be remembered for a long time. An architectural wonder even by modern standards, the palace rises 13 stories from the top of a 130 m-high mountain and contains more than 1000 rooms.<br \/>\nThe first recorded use of the site dates from the 7th century when a palace was built here. Construction of the present structure began during the reign of the 5th Dalai Lama in 1645 and took more than 50 years to complete. Zhou Enlai sent his own troops to protect it from the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution.<br \/>\nThe layout includes the rooftop White Palace used for government and the residence of the Dalai Lama, and the central Red Palace used for religious functions. The most stunning chapels house the jewel-bedecked golden chorten tombs of previous Dalai Lamas. The apartments of the 13th and 14th Dalai Lamas in the White Palace offer a more personal insight into life in the palace.<br \/>\nBefore we went into the Potala Palace, we had some time to wander around. I parked myself on a bench on the <em>kora<\/em> that goes around the palace. This may be the best people-watching in the world as pilgrims from all over Tibet come here. Prayer beads are in the left hand, and a prayer wheel is twirling in the right. Most are older and many are truly ancient but spry for their apparent age. Their skin was dark and leathery. But others are stooped with slow shuffling gaits, limps, using canes or crutches and their determination to walk the kora is impressive. Traditional dress varies but is most often a long skirt with a colourful striped apron and multiple necklaces of turquoise, amber, coral, glass and wood. Some push baby strollers.<br \/>\n<strong>Drepung Monastery<\/strong> (30\u00a5). 8 km west of the old town, it was purportedly the largest monastery in the world with around 7000 resident monks at its peak. The kings of Tsang and the Mongols visited regularly, though oddly, the Red Guards pretty much left it alone. Around 600 monks reside here now.<br \/>\n<strong>Sera Monastery<\/strong> (60\u00a5). 5 km north of central Lhasa, it was founded in 1439, and along with Drepung, was one of the great Gelugpa (Yellow Hat) monasteries. 600 monks, down from 5000, reside here. The spectacular prayer halls had ornate carvings and metalwork backing up the many Buddha images. In the afternoons, you can see Tibetan-style religious debating with lots of hand slapping and gesticulating.<br \/>\nWest of Lhasa, the people practice natural burial systems: either chopping up and putting the bodies in the river or sky burials where the bodies are eaten by birds. The bones are then collected, cremated and the ashes put in the river.<\/p>\n<p><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>TASHILHUNGO MONASTERY<\/strong>, Shigatse. Since the time of the Mongol sponsorship of the Gelugpa (Yellow Hat) order, Shigatse has been the seat to the Panchen Lama, the second-highest-ranking lama in Tibet. One could view the Dalai Lama, stationed in Lhasa, as the political leader and the Panchen Lama as the religious (and more scholarly) leader.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">This is one of the six great Gelugpa monasteries (along with Drepung, Sera and Ganden monasteries in Lhasa, Kumbum in Qinghai Province, and Labrang in Gansu). Built in 1447, the monastery is the size of a small village. It is divided into four main chapels. The <em>Temple of Maitreya<\/em> contains the 27m statue of Jampa (Maitreya) Buddha, the largest copper-gilded Maitreya Buddha in the world. The other three chapels contain the chorten tombs of the 4th, 10th, and 5th to 9th Panchen Lamas). All opulent, they are silver and gold (the 10th is covered in 500kg of gold) structures encrusted with jewels. The metal work is outstanding with the four directional gods on the sides. A simple turquoise, glass and precious stone swastika is embedded in the floor outside one of the chapels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>SAKYA<\/strong><strong>.<\/strong> In the 14th century, this monastic town, with the help of Mongol military support, became the short-lived ruler of all Tibet. The main monastery, built in 1298, is a massive fortress-like compound with high defensive walls. The serene assembly hall is easily the most impressive of any we have seen: multiple Buddha images and tomb chortens displaying marvellous metal work. The hall also contains one of Tibet\u2019s great libraries, with Buddhist manuscripts everywhere.<\/span><strong>SHAGAR MONASTERY and FORT<\/strong><strong>.<\/strong> Most people stay here for their last sleep before heading to Everest Base Camp, about 100 km south. Above the town is a monastery\/fort with a defensive wall climbing the virtually vertical ridge. After walking to the monastery and snooping around, we climbed up to the wall with its crumbling battlements and red guard towers. Unfortunately, most of the wall had been destroyed in the Cultural Revolution.<br \/>\n<strong>Bongphu Monastery<\/strong>.
