Keys to success are attending regular classes \u2013 rather than special education classes \u2013 throughout primary, middle and high schools. This enables them to learn alongside nondisabled peers rather than being sequestered with only intellectually disabled kids. They also need to develop great habits \u2013 start working on term papers and class projects on the day they were assigned, have a tutor for each of her classes, take study breaks and sit at the front of her class. Neurodiverse children have more opportunities now but still have a long way to go before special education merges with regular education. One of the biggest problems is that special education has developed as a completely separate system especially since the middle of the 20<sup>th<\/sup> century for kids with mental retardation and \u201clearning disabilities\u201d in most public schools. In the 1980s, kids with behaviour problems and ADHD were included and in the 1990s, autism and traumatic brain injury were added as eligible.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A World of Deficit, Damage, and Dysfunction<\/strong><br \/>\nThe intention was to meet the requirements of special needs children, and to an extent, they succeeded. But they also created a monolithic structure with its own unique ecology \u2013 its own diagnostic tests, special instructional programs, special jargon and philosophies. These philosophies are based on deficit, damage, and dysfunction rather than strengths, talents, and abilities. These are their \u201cslow learners.\u201d<br \/>\nThe purpose was to \u201cremediate\u201d deficits and not acknowledge their strengths or talents in music, art, dance, athletics, mechanical repair, computer programming or other nontraditional ways. Regular classes only care about competence in its most traditional and bookish sense \u2013 reading, writing, spelling, science, social studies and math in basal texts and worksheets. Individual education plans are filled but strengths are rarely given much importance. \u201cTries hard\u201d is actually negative implying that if the student were brighter, they wouldn\u2019t have to try so hard.<br \/>\nThe special education system is easier to get into than to get out of. Kids feel stigmatized to be seen going into a the special education classroom or \u201cresource room\u201d. They are often bullied or called \u201cstupid\u201d or \u201cretard\u201d experiencing emotional, social, or physical isolation.<br \/>\nAnother major problem it that special education is not very exciting. Some are rich or have teachers who are enlightened and progressive educators but usually there is little dynamic learning. Some programs are highly structured programs meant to remediate specific reading or writing skills. Many schools have no laws, policies, or guidance regarding restraint or seclusion in public schools. They are punished at disproportionate rates.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Many Children Left Behind<\/strong><br \/>\nRegular classrooms are often very restrictive even for regular classroom students. The requirements imposed are for academic achievement based on performance measured by standardized tests in reading, math and science. There\u2019s not much room to be a whole person \u2013 exercising one\u2019s physical, emotional, creative, cognitive, and spiritual capacities. Their presence as a test-taking machine is all that is generally required. And that is very restrictive.<br \/>\nIn the US, this culminated in the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 which specified heavy penalties for schools that could not make \u201cadequate yearly progress\u201d in reading, math and science tests and specified that all students must achieve proficiency in these subjects by the year 2014. By denying individual differences, it hit special education students especially hard. They were forced to take a test they had failed five times. Asking a child with dyslexia to perform on a paper-and-pencil reading test is like asking a paraplegic to run the hurdles. A child\u2019s self-esteem fell apart when test time comes around. This emphasis on standardized tests as the bottom line forces special education students to spend hours a day preparing for tests instead of learning to become successful neurodiverse human beings in their own right.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Magic of Inclusion<\/strong><br \/>\nRich learning experiences can be incorporated for both labeled and nonlabelled kids in a single classroom. Special education students are fully included by emphasizing on strengths. Kids can write great stories using special computer programs, combining geometric shapes, singing and music programs, the child with ADHD who can fix all kinds of car problems, running errands for the office or the Down student reading many books. All children should be challenged to read as much as they can, exercise, communicate, interact positively and have the goal to \u201cget smarter, feel smarter, and act smarter. These kinds of expectations are very different than those in No Child Left Behind. They need to be provided with a rich curriculum that allows all students to achieve in academic and nonacademic subjects in their own way and at their own pace.<br \/>\nTo be involved in all subjects of study, this may mean simplifying the material for students, providing accommodations, and act creatively in order to engage the child to the best of their ability. Most children with disabilities need additional supports and specialized instruction but in the context of the general curriculum \u2013 reading, writing, mathematics, social studies, science, physical education, and the arts.<br \/>\nStudents studying Shakespeare, for example, may read with their eyes, some with their fingers, one interprets it with a drawing, while others perform a skit. Reading a book, using an audiotape or using a computer program that displays and speaks the words are educational enhancements that allow them to master the material according to their unique gifts and needs.<br \/>\nDespite these being natural and relatively easy to implement (especially when compared to forcing all children to learn the same way at the same time), there is still opposition to full inclusion. Few are willing to have neurodiverse children in the regular classroom all the time. Some think it is inclusive to have a special education teacher working with special needs kids at the back of the room while the regular teacher instructs the rest of the kids in the main lesson.<br \/>\nIn many cases, it is the non-labeled kids who benefit from the experience. Beside introducing diversity, it makes the other children less selfish.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What Does a Neurodiverse Classroom Look Like?<br \/>\n<\/strong><em>\u2022 They require retraining of all teachers, both regular and special \u2013 familiarity with diversities of all kinds, expertise in utilizing assistive technologies, alternative classroom strategies, different curricula, and meeting the needs of all learners taking precedence.<\/em><br \/>\nThe neurodiverse classroom contains students with many types of diversities \u2013 culture, race, gender, sexual orientation, language and communication delays, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, spina bifida, cystic fibrosis, blindness, deafness and multiple disabilities plus students labeled as gifted and talented.<br \/>\n<em>\u2022 The neurodiverse classes uses multiple intelligences instructional strategies and other universal design for learning methods.<\/em> Removing environmental barriers (wheelchairs, strollers, skateboards, joggers and the elderly.
