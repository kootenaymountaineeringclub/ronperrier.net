There have been significant additions to national parks and other categories of protected areas in both New South Wales and Queensland.<br \/>\nFew places on Earth contain so many plants and animals whose form today remains relatively unchanged from that of their ancestors in the fossil record. There is a concentration of primitive plant families that are directly linked with the birth and spread of flowering plants over 100 million years ago, as well as some of the oldest elements of the world&#8217;s ferns and conifers.

Volcanoes erupted in sequence along the east coast during the Cenozoic Era as the Australian continental plate moved over one of the planet\u2019s hot spots resulting in the Tweed, Focal Peak, Ebor, and Barrington volcanic shields. Ongoing geological and biological processes produced marked biological diversity with ancient origins in Gondwana, many only found here.<br \/>\nThe Tweed Shield erosion caldera is possibly the best-preserved erosion caldera in the world, notable for its size and age, has a prominent central mountain mass (Wollumbin\/Mt Warning), and shows all three stages in the erosion of the caldera floor to basement rock.<br \/>\nFurther south, the remnants of the Ebor Volcano also show ongoing erosion of a shield volcano.<br \/>\nIncluded are the oldest of the world\u2019s ferns from the Carboniferous Period, Conifers from the Jurassic Period (Araucarians are the most ancient and phylogenetically primitive of the world\u2019s conifers). Angiosperms include primitive flowering plants originating in the Early Cretaceous, the primary radiation of dicotyledons in the mid-Late Cretaceous, rainforests from the \u2018golden age\u2019 of the Early Tertiary, and Miocene vegetation, the antecedent of modern temperate rainforests in Australia.<br \/>\nMany songbirds: lyrebirds, scrub-birds, treecreepers, bowerbirds, and catbirds (some of the oldest lineages of passerines that evolved in the Late Cretaceous).<br \/>\nPlants and animals show relatively recent evolution. The rainforests provide a series of distinctive habitats showing an endpoint in climatic and geomorphological evolution. The distances between these \u2018islands\u2019 of rainforests represent barriers to the flow of genetic material for those taxa that have low dispersal ability. This pressure has created the potential for continued speciation. More than 270 threatened species as well as relict and primitive taxa.<br \/>\nRainforests covered most of Australia for much of the 40 million years after its separation from Gondwana.

Maheno wreck<\/em> &#8211; a cyclone in the 1930s beached this rusting wreckage. This was a fast passenger ship running a route between NZ and Australia. In WWI, it took people between England and Egypt. By the 30s it was deemed unseaworthy, bought by a Japanese company, and was being towed when it ran into a cyclone. It is now just a rusting superstructure, about 60% below the sand. s<br \/>\n<em>3. The Pinnacles<\/em> (Colored Sands). Due to the oxidation of iron and minerals, it is mainly yellow and cream. Sacred to the Butchulla.<br \/>\n<em>4. Eli Creek.<\/em> A very shallow freshwater creek near the wreck. Has a free natural water park with an inner tube to float down the swiftly flowing creek to the ocean. 35 minutes here. Fed by the aquifer, one of the largest in the world. The water in the aquifer took 80 years to filter down through the sand. Eli Creek probably had 100 vehicles parked.<br \/>\nBuffet lunch at K&#8217;gari Resort on the east side of the island.<br \/>\n<em>5. Central Station.<\/em> Where the main community on Fraser was from 1920 to 1951. About 30 homes for the loggers.

Champagne Pools &#8211; swim.<br \/>\nIndian Head has a great panoramic view of the sand dunes and beaches behind and the ocean in front (see sea turtles, sharks, and manta rays). White-bellied sea eagles.<br \/>\nAlso is a 30-minute scenic flight (80$) to see the never-ending beach, dunes, and creeks (Butterfly), and many sharks and rays offshore from above.<br \/>\nMany more people see Fraser Island by private 4WD vehicle. Buy a permit for $60 that lasts a month. They cause traffic jams on the narrow roads. Most come equipped to camp for several days.<\/p>\n<p><strong>K&#8217;GARI (FRASER ISLAND)<\/strong> WHS lies just off the east coast of Australia. At 122 km long, 22 km wide at its widest, and 181,851 hectares, it is the largest sand island in the world. There are also a number of small adjacent islands The boundary extends 500 metres seaward from the high water mark around K\u2019gari (Fraser Island) and smaller islands.off the west coast (Stewart and Dream Islands). Majestic remnants of the tall rainforest at elevations up to 240 metres growing on the sand in coastal dune systems is unique. Half the world\u2019s perched freshwater dune lakes (exceptional in terms of number, diversity, and age) are found inland from the beach. The combination of shifting sand dunes, tropical rainforests, lakes, and the world\u2019s largest unconfined aquifer on a sand island makes it an exceptional site.<br \/>\nIt has 250 km of clear sandy beaches with long, uninterrupted sweeps of ocean beach, strikingly coloured sand cliffs, and spectacular blowouts, also unique in the world.<br \/>\nThe immense sand dunes are part of the longest and most complete age sequence of coastal dune systems in the world and are still evolving. The superimposition of active parabolic dunes on remnants of older dunes deposited during periods of low sea level, which are stabilized by towering rainforests, is considered unique.<br \/>\nSoil formation is also unique, a result of the successive overlaying of dune systems, a chronosequence of podzol development from the younger dune systems on the east to the oldest systems on the west change from rudimentary profiles less than 0.5 m thick to giant forms more than 25 m thick that exceed known depths of podzols anywhere else in the world. The older dune systems cause retrogressive succession as the soil horizon becomes too deep to provide nutrition for tall forest species.<br \/>\nBoth heathland and closed forest communities provide refuge for relict and disjunct populations. Evolution and specialized adaptation to salinity, low fertility, fire frequency, waterlogging, water table, age, nutrient status of sand dunes, and aridity.<br \/>\nPatterned fens here are the only known examples of sub-tropical patterned fens in the world. These fens support an unusual number of rare and threatened invertebrate and vertebrate species. The low shrubby heaths (\u2018wallum\u2019) are of considerable evolutionary and ecological significance.<br \/>\nFauna including a number of threatened species of frog, have adapted to the highly specialised acidic environment. Few mammal species occur. Dingoes were once common on the island, but are now decreasing. About 200 remain. They are one of the more pure strains.<br \/>\nThere are no kangaroos (no grasslands) and no koalas (none of the eucalyptus species they prefer), no platypus<br \/>\nThe majority of the island is in a National Park, and all of the marine area is in Great Sandy Marine Park.<br \/>\nBirds are the most abundant form of animal life with over 230 species mostly migratory wading birds who use the area as a resting place during their long flights between southern Australia and their breeding grounds in Siberia.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"review_image\" src=\"https:\/\/www.worldheritagesite.org\/profiles\/fotoos\/19613.jpg\" alt=\"Fraser Island by Carlo Sarion\" \/><br \/>\nThe increased recognition of the Butchulla people as its traditional owners makes it more special. The Butchulla used it seasonally with up to 2000 living here in season. There has been no Butchella community here since 1904.<br \/>\n<strong>Get in.<\/strong> Most of the tour companies operate from Noosa Heads, Rainbow Beach, and Hervey Bay. Noosa Heads and Rainbow Beach have a much earlier ferry, with a long, bumpy drive on the island.<br \/>\nStrictly limited to 4WD with no public transport (best to sit in the front as less bumpy and has better views).<br \/>\n<strong>Accommodation.<\/strong><br \/>\nNoosa Heads<br \/>\nUrangan has a good beach and a relaxed vibe<br \/>\nRainbow Beach to sleep the night before.<br \/>\nTwo resorts on the island 1. Eurong Beach Resort is cheaper near 75 Mile Beach. 2. Kingfisher Resort.<br \/>\nBackpackers at hostels sometimes rent a 4WD and take the ferry to the island. The cheapest is camping in well-maintained campsites.<\/p>\n<p>ON Mango Tourist Hostel, Hervey Bay. My second night here. As I returned from the tour to Fraser at 18:00, it made no sense to move on, and this was as cheap accommodation as could be found anywhere in Australia.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 8<\/strong> Tue Sept 26<br \/>\n<em>I sat around all morning doing business and then had a 2 1\/2-hour drive to Bundaberg.<\/em><br \/>\n<strong>Hervey Bay Historical Village &amp; Museum.<\/strong> Many relocated buildings creating a &#8220;town&#8221; &#8211; 1890 church visitor center, slab cottage, linotype and mattress making, harness, cottage, 1910 church, 1920 garage, stables, ropes cobblers, collections, shops from the 1920s, fishing.

The island is the second southernmost island in the Great Barrier Reef chain of islands (with the first (southernmost) being Lady Elliot Island). The Island is named after Lady Lucinda Musgrave, the wife of Sir Anthony Musgrave, a colonial governor of Queensland.<br \/>\nLady Musgrave Island, and the immediate surrounds, is a national park and can be reached by excursion boat from\u00a0Bundaberg\u00a0(located approximately 4 hours north of\u00a0Brisbane) and from the Town of\u00a01770, Queensland\u00a0(located approximately 5 hours north of\u00a0Brisbane).

The island has no fresh water supply, so visitors need to bring all fresh drinking water. Camping must be booked up to 11 months in advance. The daily (subject to weather) tourist boat from 1770 can resupply campers with prearranged supplies.<br \/>\nStargazing is spectacular.<br \/>\n<strong>Fauna.<\/strong> There are an enormous number of birds on the island. white-capped noddy terns nest in abundance in the Pisonia trees whilst bridled terns, black-naped terns, and silver gulls nest on the ground in more open areas nearer the beach. The carcasses of noddy tern chicks that fall out of nests or adults that become tangled in the sticky Pisonia seeds are quickly devoured by centipedes and the nutrients eventually returned to the soil. From December to May, migratory wedge-tailed shearwaters, colloquially known as &#8216;mutton birds&#8217;, nest in burrows in the interior of the island, and their mournful wails can be heard at night. These birds are readily seen along the forest walk at night and precaution must be taken to not stray from the path as the burrows easily collapse under the weight of a person. From September to March, migratory shorebirds such as ruddy turnstone, grey-tailed tattler, wandering tattler, bar-tailed godwit, Pacific golden plover, and lesser sand plover can be seen foraging on the reef flat at low tide. Buff-banded rails, white and grey phases of the eastern reef egret, pied oystercatchers, sooty oystercatchers, and Capricorn silvereyes are resident on the island year-round.<br \/>\nThe island is a nesting place for green and loggerhead turtles. Small whitetip reef sharks and leopard sharks can often be found hunting in the shallows around the island.\u00a0 Green and leatherback turtles can be spotted resting on coral bommies, and the coral lagoon is a haven for a multitude of fish and coral species and a spectacular destination for anyone interested in snorkeling. <a class=\"lightbox-added\" title=\"Discover Lady Musgrave Island - Reef Connect\" href=\"https:\/\/reefconnect.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/lady-musgrave-island-reef-connect.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/reefconnect.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/lady-musgrave-island-reef-connect.jpg 989w, https:\/\/reefconnect.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/lady-musgrave-island-reef-connect-600x338.jpg 600w, https:\/\/reefconnect.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/lady-musgrave-island-reef-connect-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/reefconnect.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/lady-musgrave-island-reef-connect-768x433.jpg 768w, https:\/\/reefconnect.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/lady-musgrave-island-reef-connect-705x397.jpg 705w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 989px) 100vw, 989px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-611 avia-img-lazy-loading-611 attachment-entry_with_sidebar size-entry_with_sidebar wp-post-image\" src=\"https:\/\/reefconnect.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/lady-musgrave-island-reef-connect-845x321.jpg\" alt=\"Discover Lady Musgrave Island - Reef Connect\" width=\"845\" height=\"321\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>GREAT BARRIER REEF WHS<\/strong><br \/>\nThe Great Barrier Reef is a site of remarkable variety and beauty on the north-east coast of Australia. The area has been exposed and flooded by at least four glacial and interglacial cycles. Reefs have grown on the continental shelf for 15,000 years. During glacial periods, sea levels dropped, exposing the reefs as flat-topped hills of eroded limestone. There are some 2,500 individual reefs of varying sizes and shapes, and over 900 islands, ranging from small sandy cays and larger vegetated cays to large rugged continental islands rising, in one instance, over 1,100 m above sea level. The continental islands support thousands of plant species. The shallower marine areas support half the world&#8217;s mangroves and seagrass species.<br \/>\nAs the world\u2019s most extensive coral reef ecosystem, it covers an area of 348,000 square km extending across a contiguous latitudinal range of 14<sup>o\u00a0<\/sup>(10<sup>o<\/sup>S to 24<sup>o<\/sup>S) &#8211; from beneath the Torres Strait to just above Fraser Island. From the low water mark along the mainland coast up to 250 km offshore, the wide depth range includes vast shallow inshore areas, mid-shelf, and outer reefs, and beyond the continental shelf, oceanic waters over 2,000 m deep. One-third of the GBR lies beyond the seaward edge of the shallower reefs.<br \/>\n400 species of corals in 60 genera range from inshore fringing reefs to mid-shelf reefs, and exposed outer reefs, in continental islands, coral cays, and reefs molded by changing climates, sea levels, and the erosive power of wind and water, over long time periods.<br \/>\nThere are over 1,500 species of fish, 4,000 species of mollusk, plus a great diversity of sponges, anemones, marine worms, crustaceans, and other species.<br \/>\n242 species of birds of which twenty-two breed on cays and some continental islands.<br \/>\nVegetation on the cays and continental islands host birds, such as the Pied Imperial Pigeon, important for seed dispersal and plant colonisation.<br \/>\nIt is one of a few living structures visible from space, appearing as a complex string of reefal structures along Australia&#8217;s northeast coast.<br \/>\nThe Whitsunday Islands are green vegetated islands and sandy beaches spread over azure waters. Whitehaven Beach and Hill Inlet on Whitsunday Island for snorkeling\/diving. Swimming with manta rays, dolphins, turtles, sharks, and colourful reef fish. Hinchinbrook Channel is next to Hinchinbrook Island and has rugged vegetated mountains and lush rainforest gullies.<br \/>\nMany cays have breeding colonies of seabirds and marine turtles. Raine Island is the world\u2019s largest green turtle breeding area. On some continental islands, large aggregations of over-wintering butterflies periodically occur.<br \/>\nCod Hole near Lizard Island has annual coral spawning, migrating whales, nesting turtles, and significant spawning aggregations of many fish species.<br \/>\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders have contributed shell deposits (middens) and fish traps, plus the application of story places and marine totems.<br \/>\nMajor feeding grounds for threatened dugong, 30 species of whales and dolphins occur, and humpback whale calving.<br \/>\nSix of the world\u2019s seven species of marine turtle occur in the GBR. As well as the world\u2019s largest green turtle breeding site at Raine Island.<br \/>\nThe globally unique array of ecological communities, habitats, and species makes it one of the most complex natural ecosystems on earth. No other World Heritage property contains such biodiversity. Nothing is comparable in size and different hues of blue\/turquoise, water clarity, variety, and amount of marine life.<br \/>\nNatural pressures include cyclones, crown-of-thorns starfish, and sudden large influxes of freshwater from extreme weather events. Tourism, shipping, and coastal developments including ports.<br \/>\n<strong>Get there.<\/strong><br \/>\nAccess from Cairns (Hamilton Island by boat, plane, and helicopter), Townsville, Port Douglas or Brisbane. The flight from Brisbane has an incredible aerial view of both Fraser Island and the GBR. Group excursions and helicopter\/seaplane tours from Hamilton Island\/Airlie Beach is Cruise Whitsundays.<br \/>\nExcursions aren&#8217;t cheap and distances require full-day trips. Snorkeling at Heart Reef and Heart Pontoon was incredible.<br \/>\n<strong>Cairns<\/strong> is not recommended for access to the Great Barrier Reef as more coral is bleached and visibility is reduced. It has high rainfall making the water siltier. It is closer to the reef and accentuates the same problem. The aerial view is not nearly as good. If you&#8217;re looking for the heart of the Great Barrier Reef, you&#8217;re in the wrong place!<br \/>\nThere are also more people here due to daily international flights from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, Indonesia, Japan, etc.). Good access to Cape Tribulation and Daintree National Park. Coral bleaching since 2016 has affected up to 80% of the reef, most noticeably more to the north. As the coral is much more intact the farther south, I was quite excited to hear about Lady Musgrave Island.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lady Musgrave Island tour.<\/strong> Full-day tour: Snorkelling, swimming with Turtles, Reef presentation, Glass Bottom Boat Reef Tour &amp; Guided Island Walking Tour. VIP upgrades and Scuba diving options are available. Departing Bundaberg Port Marina (15\/17 Marina Drive). 7:15 am daily. Duration: 10 hours. Cost: A$250. I added one dive for $70 but changed my mind once I saw what the diving would be like.\u00a0 With tax, the entire day was $260.<br \/>\nMy experience. It took about 2 hours to boat to Lady Musgrave. It was a perfect day with little wind and minimal swell. The people were divided into 5 groups of about 40, each rotating through the various attractions. I ended up with the best rotation which ended with snorkeling.<br \/>\nOn arrival, my group headed for the island in the glass-bottomed boat. We walked across the island on a shady path and the excellent guide gave great explanations. The main tree are poidian, a large tree that roots itself from its branches. it has formed a symbiotic relationship with the white-capped nottie tern. The tern supplies guano for the tree and the tree provides branches for the tern to build its nests, The male brings leaves &#8211; only about one in ten is deemed acceptable and the female builds the nest from the leaves binding it all together with guano. Most of the seabirds build their nests in the ground. The burrowing shearwater digs a 2 m-long tunnel. There were several walking around in the bush and two other kinds of tern who had ground nests.<br \/>\nWe returned to the start point on the beach which consists of a lot of coral and sand. The turtles lay eggs just inside the tree line hoping for the right amount of sun to produce the right temperature which when correct results in about 60% females and 40% males.<br \/>\nBack on the glass-bottomed boat passing over two turtle cleaning stations in the fibriated coral. Cleaner wrasses remove the moss and bacteria from the shells of the green turtles. We saw about 5 turtles in total.<br \/>\nThe coral is surprisingly very dull in colour. It is all very healthy here with no bleaching but is about 95% white or muddy brown. There are small patches of brilliantly coloured coral &#8211; blue, purple, and red. The branching coral that was actively growing had lovely blue tips.<br \/>\nOn return to the stationary boat, we had a very good buffet lunch. I then made a decision to not dive and asked for a refund of my $70. The reef is quite shallow and diving would only give marginally better views. The bland colour of the coral also made diving less spectacular.<br \/>\nI went snorkelling twice for about 45 minutes each time. Follow the edge of the reef to a narrow channel that gives access to a large open area with the best fish. There was a huge number of different species. I had a thrill swimming above a hawksbill turtle for about 15 minutes. The tide was exceptionally low and more coral was exposed than normal making it necessary to exit the larger lagoon through the same channel.<br \/>\nThe trip back was uneventful. Tea was served.<\/p>\n<p><em>After getting off the boat, I started to drive north, mostly in the dark.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\nON Highway wayside.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 10<\/strong> Thur Sept 28<br \/>\n<strong>ROCKHAMPTON<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Rockhampton Botanic Gardens.<\/strong> Opened in 1869, this lovely botanical park has many big trees (a great stand of interconnected figs, many palms, a Bunya pine, and baobabs), a Japanese garden, a lake &amp; a variety of tropical plants.

Its rich and unique biodiversity reflects the ecological and evolutionary processes. Relics of the great Gondwanan forest that covered Australia and part of Antarctica 50 to 100 million years ago. All of Australia\u2019s unique marsupials and most of its other animals originated in rainforest ecosystems, and their closest surviving relatives occur in the Wet Tropics. Demonstrates the process of evolution especially Australia\u2019s sclerophyll flora and marsupial fauna.<br \/>\nAt their latitudinal and climatic limits, they have a dry season and frequent cyclones, extremely high but seasonal rainfall, diverse terrain, and steep environmental gradients. There are forest vistas, rivers, waterfalls, rugged gorges, and coastal scenery especially between Daintree River and Cedar Bay where white sandy beaches and fringing offshore coral reefs add to the diversity. The winding channels of the Hinchinbrook Channel contain extensive mangroves and a terrestrial continuum with the Great Barrier Reef.<br \/>\nAll major stages in the evolution of land plants, from the very first pteridophytes more than 200 million years ago to the evolution of seed-producing plants including the cone-bearing cycads and southern conifers (gymnosperms), followed by the flowering plants (angiosperms). All of Australia\u2019s unique marsupials, songbirds, and most of its other animals originated in rainforest ecosystems.<br \/>\nIts tall, open forests on the drier western margins show the evolutionary continuum of rainforest and sclerophyll forests. Eucalypts, which now dominate the Australian landscape, evolved from such rainforest stock and radiated into drier environments.<br \/>\nThe high level of diversity has 3,000 vascular plant species in 224 families (576 species and 44 genera are endemic). Vertebrates include 107 mammals (11 endemic species and two genera). There are 368 bird species (11 endemic), 113 reptiles (24 endemic), and 51 amphibians (22 endemic). Many marsupials, frogs, and reptiles have restricted distributions. The flightless Australian cassowary is one of the largest birds in the world.<br \/>\nThe Wet Tropics cover less than 0.2% of Australia but contain 30% of the marsupial species, 60% of bat species, 25% of rodent species, 40% of bird species, 30% of frog species, 20% of reptile species, 60% of butterfly species, 65% of fern species, 21% of cycad species, 37% of conifer species, 30% of orchid species and 18% of Australia\u2019s vascular plant species. It is fringed and in a few places by sclerophyll forests, woodlands, swamps, and mangrove forests, adding to its diversity.<br \/>\nThe level of human impact is low, with 80% of the estimated cover originally present at the time of the first European settlement remaining as logging has been prohibited since 1987. Transmission lines, access roads, abandoned mine sites, and selectively logged areas remain. There have been invasions of exotic plants, animals, and forest diseases. Climate change with even a small increase in temperature is expected to cause large declines in the range for almost every endemic vertebrate species present.<br \/>\n<strong><em>From Cairns.<\/em><\/strong> It is an easy day trip from Cairns to Karunda and the <strong>Skyrail Rainforest Cableway<\/strong> Terminal in Smithfield.

I thought I would spend the night at Normanton on the Gulf of Carinthia. When I was almost there, it was 16:50 so instead I decided to continue driving the 375 km to Cloncurry.<\/em><br \/>\n<em>The entire way had the most amazing number of termite hills. Initially, they were large globular hills, then small, narrow pointed hills then taller pointed hills, sometimes with hundreds lining both sides of the highway.<\/em><br \/>\n<em>The terrain was completely flat and covered with bush and grass. I saw several wallabies and many emus. This is cattle country with white brahma cattle in a free range.<\/em><br \/>\n<em>At sunset, I stopped for the night at Four Ways, about halfway to Cloncurry.<\/em><br \/>\nTotal mileage: 927 (240,164).<br \/>\nJust before the roadhouse is a road signed for Riverslsligh WHS.

Everything else was closed, so I continued onto Mount Isa. Everything here was also closed except for one convenience store.<\/em><br \/>\n<em>Large areas of the bush were on fire using controlled burns. I passed two huge oversized loads, one a mammoth machine with treads the width of 3\/4&#8217;s of the road, the second a portable dock with metal stairs and a railing. A police car precedes the load advising you to pull completely off the road to let them pass.<\/em><br \/>\n<em>Continuing on towards Camooweal, there was another signed road to Riversleigh, but no information. I asked a fellow at a rest area about the road conditions. It was 148 km and he thought a significant part was gravel. So I decided to not see this section of the WHS and instead hoped that Naracoorte had easier access.<\/em><br \/>\n<em>Google Maps then had the longest single direction I could remember, 528 miles to then turn left at Three Ways &#8211; right was north to Darwin, and left was south to Alice Springs and Uluru.<\/em><br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nGO TO AUSTRALIA &#8211; NORTH\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>AUSTRALIAN FOSSIL MAMMAL SITES.

They are a superb illustration of the key stages of the evolution of Australia\u2019s unique mammals during the last 30 million years.<br \/>\nAustralia is regarded as the most biologically distinctive continent in the world, an outcome of its almost total isolation for 35 million years following its separation from Antarctica. Only two of its seven orders of singularly distinctive marsupial mammals have ever been recorded elsewhere.<br \/>\n<strong>Riversleigh<\/strong>. Older fossils from the Oligocene to Miocene, some 10-30 million years ago.

Fossils from the glacial periods of the mid-Pleistocene to the current day (from 530,000 years ago to the present) illustrate their response to climate change and to human impacts. Included are superbly preserved Australian ice age megafauna (giant, now extinct mammals, birds, and reptiles), such as the enigmatic extinct marsupial lion (Thylocoleo carnifex). Also, modern species include marsupials such as the Tasmanian devil, Tasmanian tiger, wallabies, and possums; placental mammals including mice and bats; and snakes, lizards, frogs, and turtles.
