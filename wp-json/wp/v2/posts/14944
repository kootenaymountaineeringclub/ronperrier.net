His\u00a0One Square Inch of Silence\u00a0project in\u00a0Olympic National Park\u00a0spotlighted in 2005 what he then considered the quietest place in the United States. Hempton is a co-founder of\u00a0Quiet Parks International\u00a0(QPI), a nonprofit dedicated to putting natural quiet within reach of as much of the world\u2019s population as possible by certifying and protecting peaceful places.<\/p>\n<p>In early June, QPI certified the world\u2019s first Urban Quiet Park in one of the most densely populated places on the planet. Just north of Taipei,\u00a0Taiwan,\u00a0Yangmingshan National Park\u00a0is a 43-square-mile area known for its relaxing hot springs, mountainous terrain, and endemic birds. \u201cUrban Quiet Parks offer natural beauty and inner stillness on a daily basis, and they offer it to a target set of people who desperately need quiet,\u201d says Vikram Chauhan, president of QPI.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\" data-bumper-index=\"1\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/62a6e830-54da-4a1b-b046-a3a62afe5946\/006_nationalgeographic_2739730.jpg?w=1280&amp;h=640\" alt=\"olympic national park in washington stsate\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">At Washington\u2019s Olympic National Park, visitors can revel in nature\u2019s soothing sounds.

QPI\u2019s aim is to certify roughly 50 Urban Quiet Parks around the world in coming years, in addition to Wilderness Quiet Parks. The certification of Yangmingshan National Park as the first of its kind feels particularly poignant during pandemic times, when many people on lockdown\u2014particularly those living in cities where noise pollution usually dominates the soundscape\u2014may have experienced relative quiet for the first time in their lives. Last year, QPI certified the Zabalo River in\u00a0Ecuador\u00a0as its first Wilderness Quiet Park. The organization is eyeing potential Urban Quiet Parks in places including\u00a0New York City,\u00a0Miami, and\u00a0Stockholm.<\/p>\n<p>While there are no naturally quiet places left on Earth\u2014according to Hempton, human-made noise, usually in the form of transportation (by highway, rail, air, and boat) pervades every corner of the planet\u2014QPI uses varying standards of stillness to certify its wilderness and urban quiet parks. Regular acoustic studies are carried out after a park\u2019s certification to ensure it\u2019s held to QPI\u2019s standards.<\/p>\n<p>Natural sounds, of course, register increased decibels\u2014imagine the pound of surf on a beach or a chorus of singing frogs\u2014but the goal, explains Ulf Bohman, executive director of Urban Quiet Parks, is for the background noise to be no higher than 45 decibels. That\u2019s akin to library-level chatter.<\/p>\n<h2>Where hush is healing<\/h2>\n<p>The effects of noise pollution on humans have been widely studied and attributed to health issues that range from stress and sleep disturbances to high blood pressure and heart disease. Places with natural quiet are important to animals, as well, says Jesse Barber, associate professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at Boise State University. \u201cHuman-caused noise is known to interfere with animals\u2019 abilities to hear important sounds, like birdsong, and to fundamentally alter where animals live and their reproductive fitness,\u201d he says.<br \/>\n\u201cEven U.S. national parks experience significant noise exposure at levels known to impact wildlife,\u201d says Barber. In a noise reduction study at\u00a0Muir Woods National Monument\u00a0in California, where signs urged visitors to turn down the volume in one area of the park, he says, the result was an increased number of birds near the trails.<br \/>\nIn the U.S., the areas with the most potential for tranquil experiences are those with the least flyover traffic from airplanes and remoteness from other transportation noises, according to Les Blomberg, executive director of the\u00a0Noise Pollution Clearinghouse, a nonprofit organization that has\u00a0mapped out\u00a0the last remaining places of natural quiet in the continental U.S.<br \/>\nThe organization\u2019s research indicates that places including the\u00a0Boundary Waters Canoe Area\u00a0of northern Minnesota and\u00a0Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex\u00a0in western Montana are among the country\u2019s last remaining natural quiet areas. The northernmost U.S. states are generally more likely to have spaces of natural quiet, says Blomberg.<\/p>\n<p>Hempton points to\u00a0Haleakal\u0101 National Park\u00a0in Maui (the crater of which he considers the quietest place on Earth),\u00a0Glacier National Park, and\u00a0Big Bend National Park\u00a0among the U.S. parks embarking on initial certification as Wilderness Quiet Parks with QPI.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--content-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/2eac5769-5fca-42db-9093-c7d74ce34279\/003_pywyn5.jpg?w=636&amp;h=424\" alt=\"scenes from yangmingshan national park in taipei taiwan\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">A woman treks through Yangmingshan National Park\u2019s subtropical forest.

Williams, an advisor for QPI, believes a cultural shift is necessary to help people value and steward quiet in urban areas.<\/p>\n<div>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--content-width InlineElement--desktop InlineVideo\" aria-label=\"Video\">\n<div class=\"SingleVideo\">\n<div data-meta-id=\"inline-3\">\n<div class=\"NatGeoVideoPlayer NatGeoVideoPlayer--videoPlaying aspect-ratio--parent aspect-ratio--16x9 VideoPlayer\">\n<div class=\"VideoPlayer--placeholder absolute-fill\">\n<div class=\"MediaPlaceholder relative MediaPlaceholder--16x9 cursor-pointer height-contain\" tabindex=\"-1\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent MediaPlaceholder__Image\">\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper aspect-ratio--child\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/6b9a75be-a1e5-4955-a516-abd0e25c6a0c\/0000015c-b322-d466-a57e-bbaa67e20000_16x9.jpg?w=636&amp;h=358\" alt=\"\" aria-hidden=\"true\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<div class=\"LoadAnimation LoadAnimation--darkBG LoadAnimation--md\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">HE HEARS MUSIC IN THE QUIETEST PLACE ON EARTH\u2014CAN YOU?<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">Acoustic ecologist Gordon Hempton has spent the past 35 years recording natural soundscapes.

I\u2019m expecting more and more people in the world will come to my country and hear the natural quiet of Taiwan.\u201d For QPI, the hope is that by certifying a few places in every country, people who wish to access natural quiet will be able to find it. \u201cWe aren\u2019t saying that quiet is for everyone and that everyone should experience it,\u201d says Hempton, \u201cbut I do feel the choice is essential to quality of life.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Discover the planet\u2019s last few \u2018naturally quiet\u2019 places From Taiwan to Washington state, peaceful places remind us that quiet has the power to heal, especially in these pandemic times.
