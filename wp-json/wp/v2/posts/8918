As none of us had been to the east one, we set off on a fine, sunny late October Saturday for an attempt. Our party of Janice Isaac, Peter Tchir, Myler Wilkinson, and the reporter caught the 8:10 ferry and drove up the snowy power line road to the trailhead at 6300\u2019.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Our plan was to hike up the trail to avoid bushwhacking, then diagonal across the main summit\u2019s south ridge to reach an alpine basin south of our goal. We found this to be do-able but not recommended, at least at this season. The snowy slopes of the south ridge were treacherous enough that we found it better to continue straight up the ridge rather than traverse. Reaching a flat section at 7600\u2019, we descended 200\u2019 to the east on slippery, snowy turf and rock (about 8\u201d of coverage), then continued north through alpine terrain to the col between the east and central summits (252-975, 7850\u2019). After a brief snack, we finished off the remaining 600\u2019 of our peak\u2019s west face, a walk-up, and arrived at the large cairn (no record) thankfully located at the northwest end of the peak. Our ascent had taken about 3.5 hours from the truck.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Deciding we wanted no part of returning via the ascent route, we lingered on top a scant 25 minutes, then returned easily to the col. From this point, we headed due south, passing west of a tarn not on the map, easily reached the power line road about 400 m. east of our truck, and were back by 3:30. As our descent took a scant 90 minutes and provided only minor bushwhacking, we recommend that other parties reach the peak via this route. Alternatively, the south ridge of the peak could be followed right from the power line road.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Kim Kratky\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SPHINX MOUNTAIN\u00a0\u00a0 2591m\u00a0 \u00a08500&#8242; Visible due east from the entrance to the West Arm on the Kootenay Lake ferry, this route follows a hiker-made trail as it passes subalpine meadows to a summit with great views.
