The Nakusp &amp; Slocan Rail Trail connects the charming waterfront towns of Nakusp and New Denver, passing peaceful Summit Lake as it winds its way between towering mountains. Starting in New Denver, the Galena Rail Trail climbs along a bumpy abandoned mining trail to Three Forks and features a memorable cable car over a rushing creek below.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>HISTORY<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The railway route was built during the mining boom in the Kootenays during the 1890s. A major silver find on Payne Mountain immediately grew into the city of Sandon (now a ghost town) and the CPR wanted to connect the region with their mainline. The Great Northern Railway, its big competitor in the area, was backing the Kaslo and Slocan Railway (K&amp;S) that was building a <span class=\"nowrap\">3\u00a0ft<\/span>\u00a0(<span class=\"nowrap\">914\u00a0mm<\/span>)\u00a0narrow gauge railway\u00a0from\u00a0Kaslo\u00a0on\u00a0Kootenay Lake\u00a0west to Sandon.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The railway received its charter from the provincial government in 1892 and was immediately leased by the CPR. By October 1894, the railway had been completed from Nakusp, along Slocan Lake and up the valley to Three Forks. When the K&amp;S connected to Sandon in 1895, which was growing into a bigger community in the area, the CPR decided to extend the line to Sandon by a 7 km (4.3 mi) extension.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The N&amp;S and the K&amp;S were aggressively competitive for the ore produced by the mines in the area. At one point, K&amp;S demolished the CPR depot after it was built on contested land. In 1912, with the mining slowing down, the CPR bought K&amp;S and built a new line up Carpenter Creek to the pass and a connection with the grade of the K&amp;S. The narrow gauge K&amp;S was\u00a0rebuilt\u00a0to\u00a0<span class=\"nowrap\">4\u00a0ft\u00a0<span class=\"frac\">8<span class=\"visualhide\">\u00a0<\/span><sup>1<\/sup>\u2044<sub>2<\/sub><\/span>\u00a0in<\/span>\u00a0(<span class=\"nowrap\">1,435\u00a0mm<\/span>) (standard gauge) and the entire line to Kaslo was operated as part of the CPR.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The N&amp;S also served as a connection between the CPR&#8217;s C&amp;K railway connecting to Nelson, the smelter at Trail and other points. Before the southern mainline was completed, the N&amp;S was the bypass route, rather than using boats up the entire length of the Arrow Lakes, which was often blocked by ice and low water.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Decreasing traffic, high maintenance costs, and railway deregulation led to services being cut back and eventually abandoned during the latter part of the 20th century. The line between New Denver and Kaslo was severed in the 1950s due to mudslides, and the rails were removed from Kaslo in the 1970s. The last rail car ferry on Slocan Lake was closed in 1988.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Parts of the line have been converted to a multi-use rail trail, known as the Slocan Valley Rail Trail.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>GALENA TRAIL &#8211; <\/strong>12.8km<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The original railway from New Denver ended at Three Forks and relied on the mines in Sandon to transport their ore to this trailhead. But when the Kaslo &amp; Slocan Railway built their line to Sandon in 1895, the CPR was forced also to extend their line up one of the steepest railway grades ever built. The CPR and the N&amp;S line provided service to the mines of Sandon until 1955.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Km 0 Three Forks.<\/strong> Where the three creeks come together.
