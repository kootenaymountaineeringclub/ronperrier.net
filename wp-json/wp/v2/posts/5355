The pubs serve pie and chips even in 25-degree heat. It seems like a Brexiteer\u2019s paradise. Yet while 17m Britons were voting to leave the European Union on June 23rd, Gibraltar \u2014 a tiny British Overseas Territory dangling from the southern coast of Spain \u2014 voted by 19,322 to 823 to stay. Their votes \u201cdid not even move the needle\u201d, Gibraltar\u2019s chief minister, Fabian Picardo, told a crestfallen public the following day. The peninsula now faces an uncertain future outside the EU, which has helped underwrite decades of prosperity and kept the all-important border open. Spain has periodically pressed its claim to Gibraltar (and laid siege to it twice) since ceding it to Britain in 1713.<\/p>\n<p>For now, the EU flag still flutters alongside the Union Jack above the government building. Inside, Mr Picardo is confident that his government can deliver the 8.25% annual growth promised in its pre-election manifesto in November, which had supposedly priced in the risk of Brexit. But many worry that Spain could close the border again, as it did between 1969 and 1985. Within hours of the result, the Spanish foreign minister, Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Margallo, crowed: \u201cThe Spanish flag is now much closer to the Rock.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Gibraltar\u2019s booming economy (growth came in at 10.6% last year) relies on the thousands of Spanish workers who cross the border every day. Christian Hernandez, president of the chamber of commerce, says the peninsula\u2019s thriving financial-services sector is at risk, too: \u201cThe whole way we\u2019ve marketed the jurisdiction is as a gateway into Europe.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Some industries will prove immune. Roughly 90% of Gibraltar\u2019s insurance and online-betting business consists of transactions with Britain, Mr Picardo reckons. Low tax rates will help keep firms in place. \u201cWe don\u2019t see Gibraltar plc collapsing,\u201d says John Westwood, managing director of Blacktower, a financial-services company based in the territory. And Mr Picardo gives short shrift to Mr Garcia-Margallo\u2019s threats over sovereignty: \u201cAnother day, another stupid remark.\u201d The British Foreign Office insists it will not even discuss the issue.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, self-interest is likely to mute Spanish sabre-rattling. Gibraltar provides 25% of the economy of the neighbouring Spanish area of Campo de Gibraltar; the region of Andalusia as a whole suffers 32% unemployment. \u201cOur economy is completely dependent on Gibraltar,\u201d says Juan Franco, mayor of the border town of La L\u00ednea de la Concepci\u00f3n. Thirty-year-old Tamara G\u00f3mez commutes daily from La L\u00ednea to her waitressing job, and has never been able to find a job in Spain: \u201cThe only money I\u2019ve ever earned is in Gibraltar.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Some even think the future will be brighter. A Shell-operated liquid natural gas terminal will come online by mid-2017. A new secure data facility is housed deep within the Rock. The government hopes to forge tighter links with Morocco and Africa beyond. Tarik El-Yabani, one of the few local Leave activists, thinks that Gibraltar could position itself as \u201cthe Hong Kong of Europe\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, many are hoping that Gibraltar will somehow avoid Brexit. Mr Picardo is conferring with his counterparts in Scotland about how to remain within the EU, and has called for a second referendum to be held once the details of Britain\u2019s prospective relationship with Brussels are hashed out. Whatever the result, Gibraltar\u2019s politicians and people have displayed remarkable unity, both in their stance during the referendum and in their efforts to cope with the consequences. In this, red phone booths or no, Gibraltar looks very little like Britain.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SPAIN, GIBRALTAR &#038; BREXIT Rock out &#8211; A territory is dragged from Europe against its will.
