Nanoose Bay is 25-kilometres northwest of Nanaimo on Highway 19.<br \/>\nThe ruggedly beautiful islands offer a unique ecology and diverse ecosystems. Situated in the rain shadow of the Vancouver Island mountain range, the climate is a mild and relatively dry Mediterranean climate. The islands are a must for protection, having been recognized as an excellent example of the endangered Garry-Oak Meadow ecosystem. In Canada, this ecosystem in only found on southern Vancouver Island. Under the knarly Garry oaks and beautiful arbutus, visitors will find rare wildflowers and plant species; including the camas lily and chocolate lily. South Winchelsea Island also offers opportunities to see bald eagles, black oystercatchers, and numerous other birds.<br \/>\nThey are perfect for a relaxed day of paddling or for a few days of camping. Four of the islands are privately owned and the other 15 are crown land.<br \/>\nThe archipelago is clearly all about nature. Pacific white-sided dolphins, killer whales and humpbacks can be sighted on occasion in these waters. The rocky shores are haul-outs for Northern and California sea lions in winter and harbour seals are ubiquitous year-round. During March, rafts of diving birds stop to feed on herring while travelling to northern and interior BC breeding grounds. The islands are blanketed with mosses, lichens and especially in the spring, wildflowers. Scores of smaller plants grow here, too, including oceanspray, chocolate lily, sea blush, yellow monkey-flower, and camas, long a source of nourishment for the Coast Salish.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"align_center\" src=\"https:\/\/bcparksfoundation.ca\/site\/assets\/files\/3311\/marine_park_map.568x513-cropx0y34-is.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"568\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>SOUTH WINCHELSEA ISLAND<\/strong><br \/>\nPurchased in 1998 by the Land Conservancy of British Columbia, 10.4-hectare South Winchelsea is an ecological reserve, one of four islands in the archipelago that are privately owned. TLC is still campaigning to pay the mortgage and maintain the property. The Nanaimo and Area Land Trust and the Islands Trust Fund Board hold a conservation covenant on the island.<br \/>\nThere is a dock on South Winchelsea Island, which is open to the public, but access is restricted to a single trail to protect the sensitive Garry Oak Ecosystem. The tall Douglas firs on South Winchelsea Island contain several eagle nests and up to 75 eagles have been seen around the Island at a time.<br \/>\nThe Land Conservancy\u00a0offers an exciting holiday at the Robert T. Ogilvie Research Cottage (3 bedrooms) for those who seek a wonderful vacation in an unusual and beautiful setting.<br \/>\nEach July, Nanaimo hosts the internationally acclaimed\u00a0Marine Festival\u00a0and\u00a0World Championship Bathtub Race\u00a0from Nanaimo Harbour around Winchelsea Islands to Departure Bay beach.<\/p>\n<p><strong>NORTH WINCHELSEA ISLAND<br \/>\n<\/strong>This island bristles with communications arrays as operations centre of Canadian Forces Maritime Experimental and Test Ranges. Kayakers are not permitted to land on the island but can safely paddle along the shore. The firing of unarmed torpedoes occurs in a closed hazard area extending north and east of the archipelago.<br \/>\n<strong>Whiskey Golf Military Test Range.<\/strong> It is the most important of the four test ranges jointly operated by the United States and Canada\u00a0 armed forces. Whiskey Golf occupies a 24X8km area in the Ballenas Basin. At\u00a0 400m, it is the deepest part of the Strait of Georgia. There are 21m thick sediments on the western side from the Fraser River which deposits about half a centimetre annually.<br \/>\nBecause of its depth and flat bottom, Ballenas Basin was chosen for testing military warfare equipment, especially torpedoes, sonar, and sonobuoys. Due to the large number of submarine cables terminating at Winchelsea Island, a no prawn or crab fishing (no bottom contact) and no anchoring zone exists within this area.<br \/>\nThe torpedo testing range has been operating since 1967. The range tests between 300 to 400 torpedos annually, most of them American and launched from surface craft. There have been 31,000 test firings since the range opened. An average of two submarines and six surface ships visit the range each year. Since the range opened, as of 1999 there had been 246 visits by U.S. surface ships, 162 by U.S. submarines, six by Canadian submarines and 254 by Canadian ships. A Chilean submarine visited Nanoose in 1994.<br \/>\nThe range employs 57 people, including 11 Canadian military naval officers and six U.S. civilian technicians. The U.S. has invested $170-million in the facility. Canada\u2019s investment is $47-million.\u00a0 In 1996, the U.S. Navy said it had saved $2 billion over 30 years by using Nanoose Bay.<br \/>\nWhen Whiskey Golf is active, no vessels \u2014 pleasure craft or commercial \u2014 are allowed to enter.\u00a0A safe transit corridor of 1\/2 nautical mile north of Winchelsea Island and 1\/2\u00a0nautical mile east of Ballenas Island is available for passage.

It is a good example of a rocky coastal bluff ecosystem.<br \/>\nThe primary campsite (49\u00b0 18.622&#8242;\u00a0lng\u00a0-124\u00b0 9.757&#8242;) is on the WSW aspect of the island. Easy landing is on a protected pebble, moderate gradient beach. There are several tent sites. 1. Several on upper beach pebble berm that erode and need to be levelled and reconstructed annually 2. At least three level upland areas were cleared of ivy. No facilities or services.<br \/>\nLanding on the SW side is normally preferred. Other beaches may be suitable depending on wind and swell direction. The NW cove is gravel, cobble with some boulders. The SE cove is cobble with many drift logs.<br \/>\nThese islands have been lived on at various times. Gerald Island shows this most poignantly \u2013 the primary campsite was once a home site and is and was heavily invaded by both English ivy and Himilayan blackberry.<br \/>\nIt would appear that Gerald planted one cutting of ivy and it has since totally taken over this bay. The 7 large trees in the near upland were all completely girdled with ivy and in some trees, ivy formed two-thirds of the foliage of the tree. Ivy bushes and blackberry covered the flat area in and around these large trees. We kept removing more bushes. When all the ivy and blackberry was removed, we had \u201cexcavated\u201da clearing, obviously the site of the original homestead. Short rock walls and a fire pit were found. Ivy also formed a complete carpet covering the foreshore and extended up the rocky cliffs.<br \/>\nThe original plan was to bag all the ivy in six super sacs, the best way to deal with most marine debris. The super sacs supplied all had narrow mouths and the tops had to be removed. It soon became apparent that there was way more ivy than 6 bags could handle and it was a lot of work to cut up the ivy and stuff the bags. We eventually piled all the ivy along the back of the drift logs at the back of the beach and formed an enormous, long pile. Two other big piles at either end of the beach were also formed.<br \/>\nThe foreshore of this beach is completely covered in ivy \u2013 both as bushes that extend into the native shrubbery and as a low \u201ccarpet\u201dthat has completely covered entire area between the logs at the back of the beach and extending 10-20meters back to the bushes. Some of this was cleared but probably 80% remained after our three days on Gerald.<br \/>\n<strong>Method of removing ivy:<\/strong> Thankfully, ivy is very soft and easy to saw, but it grows differently according to location.<br \/>\nGirdle around trees. A small pruning saw worked best to cut the dense tangles of ivy. On all the trees eventually about two metres of ivy was removed from the bottom of the trunks. Then as much ivy as possible was removed to an area extending a metre out from the tree.<br \/>\nBush. In shady areas, ivy forms individual bushes. Each trunk was followed back to where it appeared to originate. One cut often resulted in a big tree with branches that extended well into the surrounding bush. We eventually found the \u201cmother tree\u201d, a huge trunk from which everything else seemed to emanate especially over the dense matt of roots. The blackberry was much more labour intensive to remove.<br \/>\nLow ground cover. The ivy on the foreshore could be rolled up with some difficulty to expose the fine roots. A matlock was useful to cut roots. To me it seemed easiest to take a small patch of 2-3 square metres and work up from the sides.<br \/>\nIn the end the bags were used to completely contain the marine debris, the small amount of broom found on the island and all the blackberry that was tediously completely cut up and packed into supersacs. Nick\u2019s boat made 2 extra trips to haul the sacs and debris to the marina where a truck had been hired to haul it all away.<br \/>\nPlans to return in September were made \u2013 All the stuff we cut should be dry and ready to burn and a few days of work would go a long ways to removing the rest of the ivy on the island.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BALLENAS ISLANDS<br \/>\nSouth Ballenas<\/strong> is a federal defence property that is off-limits to the public (despite the occasional camping kayaker),<br \/>\n<strong>West Ballenas<\/strong>\u00a0was privately owned, recently up for sale for $1.45-million and purchased by BC Parks.

It climbs by means of\u00a0aerial rootlets\u00a0with matted pads which cling strongly to the substrate. The ability to climb on surfaces varies with the plants variety and other factors: Hedera helix prefers non-reflective, darker and rough surfaces with near-neutral\u00a0pH.

Ivy extracts are part of current cough medicines. In the past, the leaves and berries were taken orally as an\u00a0expectorant\u00a0to treat cough and\u00a0bronchitis.\u00a0In 1597, the British herbalist\u00a0John Gerard\u00a0recommended water infused with ivy leaves as a wash for sore or watering eyes.\u00a0The leaves can cause severe\u00a0contact dermatitis\u00a0in some people.\u00a0People who have this allergy (strictly a\u00a0type IV hypersensitivity) are also likely to react to carrots and other members of the\u00a0Apiaceae\u00a0as they contain the same allergen,\u00a0falcarinol.<br \/>\n<strong>Invasive species.<\/strong> Like other exotic species, ivy has predominantly been spread to areas by human action.\u00a0<em>H. helix<\/em>\u00a0is labeled as an\u00a0invasive species\u00a0in many parts of the United States, and its sale or import is banned in the state of\u00a0Oregon.<br \/>\nWith a great capacity for adaptation, Ivy will grow wherever development conditions and habitat similar to that of its European origins exist, occurring as opportunistic species across a wide distribution with close\u00a0vicariant\u00a0relatives and few species, indicating recent speciation.<br \/>\n<em>Australia.<\/em> It is considered a noxious weed across southern, particularly south-eastern, Australia and local councils provide free information and limited services for removal.

State- and county-sponsored efforts are encouraging the destruction of ivy in forests of the\u00a0Pacific Northwest\u00a0and the\u00a0Southern United States. \u00a0Its sale or import is banned in\u00a0Oregon.\u00a0Ivy can easily escape from cultivated gardens and invade nearby parks, forests and other natural areas.<br \/>\n<strong>Control and eradication.<\/strong> Ivy should not be planted or encouraged in areas where it is invasive. Where it is established, it is very difficult to control or eradicate. In the absence of active and ongoing measures to control its growth, it tends to crowd out all other plants, including shrubs and trees.<br \/>\n<strong>Damage to trees.<\/strong> Ivy can climb into the canopy of young or small trees in such density that the trees fall over from the weight,\u00a0a problem which does not normally occur in its native range. In its mature form, dense ivy can destroy habitat for native wildlife and creates large sections of solid ivy where no other plants can develop.<br \/>\n<strong>Use as building facade green.<\/strong> As with any self-climbing facade green, some care is required to make best use of the positive effects: Ivy covering the walls of an old building is a familiar and often attractive sight. It has insulating as well as weather protection benefits, dries the soil and prevents wet walls, but can be problematic if not managed correctly.<br \/>\nIvy, and especially European ivy (<em>H. helix<\/em>) grows vigorously and clings by means of fibrous roots, which develop along the entire length of the stems. These are difficult to remove, leaving an unsightly &#8220;footprint&#8221; on walls, and possibly resulting in expensive resurfacing work. Additionally, ivy can quickly invade gutters and roof spaces, lifting tiles and causing blockages. It also harbours mice and other unwelcome creatures. The plants have to be cut off at the base, and the stumps dug out or killed to prevent regrowth. Therefore, if a green facade is desired, this decision has to be made consciously, since later removal would be tedious.<br \/>\n<strong>Mechanism of Attachment.<\/strong> <em>Hedera helix<\/em>\u00a0is able to climb relatively smooth vertical surfaces, creating a strong, long lasting adhesion with a force of around 300 nN.\u00a0This is accomplished through a complex method of attachment starting as\u00a0adventitious roots\u00a0growing along the stem make contact with the surface and extend root hairs that range from 20-400 \u03bcm in length. These tiny hairs grow into any small crevices available, secrete glue-like\u00a0nanoparticles, and lignify. As they dry out, the hairs shrink and curl, effectively pulling the root closer to the surface. The glue-like substance is a nano composite adhesive that consists of uniform spherical nanoparticles 50-80 nm in diameter in a liquid polymer matrix. Chemical analyses of the nanoparticles detected only trace amounts of metals, once thought be responsible for their high strength, indicating that they are largely organic. Recent work has shown that the nanoparticles are likely composed in large part of\u00a0arabinogalactan\u00a0proteins (AGPs), which exist in other plant adhesives as well. The matrix portion of the composite is made of\u00a0pectic polysaccharides. Calcium ions present in the matrix induce interactions between\u00a0carboxyl groups\u00a0of these components, causing a cross linking that hardens the adhesive.<\/p>\n<p><strong>RUBUS ARMENIACUS (Himalayan Blackberry)<em><br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong><em>Rubus armeniacus<\/em>, the\u00a0Himalayan blackberry or\u00a0Armenian blackberry, is a species of\u00a0<em>Rubus<\/em>\u00a0in the\u00a0blackberry\u00a0group.
