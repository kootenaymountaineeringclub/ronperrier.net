Erratics are formed by glacial\u00a0ice erosion\u00a0resulting from the movement of ice.\u00a0Glaciers\u00a0erode by multiple processes: abrasion\/scouring,\u00a0plucking, ice thrusting and\u00a0glacially-induced spalling. Glaciers crack pieces of bedrock off in the process of plucking, producing the larger erratics. In an abrasion process, debris in the basal ice scrapes along the bed, polishing and gouging the underlying rocks, similar to sandpaper on wood, producing smaller\u00a0glacial till. In ice thrusting, the glacier freezes to its bed, then as it surges forward, it moves large sheets of frozen sediment at the base along with the glacier. Glacially-induced spalling occurs when\u00a0ice lens\u00a0formation with the rocks below the glacier spall off layers of rock, providing smaller debris which is ground into the glacial basal material to become till.<br \/>\n\u2022 They can be transported by <strong>glaciers,<\/strong> and they are thereby one of a series of indicators which mark the path of prehistoric glacier movement. Their lithographic origin can be traced to the parent bedrock, allowing for confirmation of the ice flow route.<br \/>\n\u2022 They can be transported by\u00a0<strong>ice rafting<\/strong>. This allows quantification of the extent of glacial flooding resulting from ice dam failure which release the waters stored in\u00a0proglacial lakes\u00a0such as\u00a0Lake Missoula. One of the more unusual examples is found far from its origin in Idaho at\u00a0Erratic Rock State Natural Site\u00a0just outside\u00a0McMinnville, Oregon. The park includes a 40-short-ton (36\u00a0t) specimen, the largest erratic found in the\u00a0Willamette Valley.<br \/>\n\u2022 Erratics dropped by<strong>\u00a0icebergs<\/strong>\u00a0melting in the ocean can be used to track Antarctic and Arctic-region glacial movements for periods prior to record retention. Also known as\u00a0dropstones, these can be correlated with ocean temperatures and levels to better understand and calibrate\u00a0models of the global climate.<br \/>\n\u2022 <strong>Rock avalanches<\/strong> onto the upper surface of the glacier (supraglacial). Rock\u00a0avalanche\u2013supraglacial\u00a0transport occurs when the glacier undercuts a rock face, which fails by avalanche onto the upper surface of the glacier. The characteristics of rock\u00a0avalanche\u2013supraglacial\u00a0transport includes: Monolithologic composition \u2013 a cluster of boulders of similar composition are frequently found in close proximity.

The boulders are composed of distinctive angular quartzite and pebbly quartzite\u00a0and between 1 foot (0.30\u00a0m) and 135 feet (41\u00a0m) in length. These are glacial erratics\u00a0that lie upon a superficial blanket of\u00a0Late Wisconsin\u00a0glacial\u00a0till. The largest glacial erratic within the Foothills Erratics Train is\u00a0Big Rock.<br \/>\nThe narrow strip of prairie covered by the Foothills Erratics Train extends along the eastern flanks of the\u00a0Rocky Mountains\u00a0of Alberta and northern\u00a0Montana\u00a0to the International Border. The boulders of the Foothills Erratics Train consist of pink and purple Lower\u00a0Cambrian\u00a0shallow marine quartzite and\u00a0conglomeratic\u00a0quartzite, that are not native to this region of Alberta. These rocks only occur within the\u00a0Gog Group\u00a0that is exposed in the\u00a0Tonquin Valley\u00a0in the\u00a0Rocky Mountains\u00a0of central western Alberta. Their specific source has been identified as being near\u00a0Mount Edith Cavell\u00a0in\u00a0Jasper National Park. Lying on prairie to the east of the Rocky Mountains, the larger glacial erratics of the Foothills Erratics Train are visible for a considerable distance across the prairie and likely served as a prominent landmark for Indigenous people.<br \/>\n<strong>Geologic History<\/strong><br \/>\nNear the end of the Pleistocene, between 12,000 and 17,000 years ago, a massive landslide occurred within the Tonquin Valley in the Rocky Mountains of central western Alberta. This landslide deposited millions of tonnes of beige to pinkish quartzite and quartzitic conglomerate of the Gog Group onto the top of a valley glacier. This mass of rock was carried eastward by the glacier. After leaving its valley within the Rocky Mountains, it collided with the\u00a0Laurentide Ice Sheet and was diverted southward. It was now coalesced between two very large ice masses\u2014the Cordilleran Ice Sheet to the west, and the Laurentide Ice Sheet to the east as they flowed parallel to the eastern flanks of the Rocky Mountains as far south as northern Montana before the ice sheet stagnated and melted. As the ice sheet melted, the erratics were deposited as the narrow line of rocks known as the Foothills Erratics Train.<br \/>\nAs they were transported, they weren&#8217;t broken up into smaller blocks, rounded, nor marked with glacial striations because they were carried either on top or in the upper part of the glacier as it moved.\u00a0 The movement of the ice sheet was also parallel and non-turbulent.<\/p>\n<p><strong>OKOTOKS ERRATIC<\/strong><br \/>\nVisible from considerable distance across the relatively flat terrain of the prairie landscape, \u2018Big Rock\u2019 is an enormous glacial erratic. The 16,500-tonne (18,200-ton) boulder was originally part of a mountain formation in what is now Jasper National Park. During the last ice age &#8211; about 30,000 years ago &#8211; a large rockslide crashed debris onto the surface of a glacier that occupied the present day Athabasca River valley, and this debris, including Big Rock, was carried out of the mountains on the glacial surface between 10,000 to 30,000 years ago. As the ice melted and the glacier retreated to the mountains, the rocky debris, including this huge erratic, were\u00a0deposited across the prairies. <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"responsive&quot;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.alberta.ca\/assets\/images\/ct-map-okotoks.jpg\" alt=\"Map of Okotoks\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The Indigenous Blackfoot peoples name for the erratic is derived from their word for rock,\u00a0which is &#8220;okatok.&#8221;<br \/>\nThe Okotoks Erratic &#8211; made up of\u00a0quartzite that is light grey, pink, to purplish in colour &#8211; measures about 9-metres tall, 41-metres long and 18-metres wide, or about the size of a three-storey apartment building.<br \/>\nIt is a piece of the Gog Formation; layers of sediment deposited between 600 million and 520 million years ago in a shallow sea eons before the uplift of the Rocky Mountains.

The heat and pressure generated by the weight of the overlying sediments compacted the sand grains and cemented them into an extremely hard, durable rock called quartzite.
