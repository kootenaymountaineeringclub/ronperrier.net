Its waters are clear and calm for most of the year. Founded in 1905, it was a small fishing village, but it has grown into a major Red Sea holiday destination for Europeans starting in the 1980s. The city is known for its\u00a0watersports (windsurfing,\u00a0kitesurfing,\u00a0yachting,\u00a0scuba diving\u00a0and\u00a0snorkeling), nightlife and warm weather. Daytime temperatures are around 30\u00a0\u00b0C most of the year (July and August over 40\u00a0\u00b0C).
