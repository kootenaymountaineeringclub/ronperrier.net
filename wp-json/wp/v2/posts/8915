Crawford Bay is on the east side. Including Pilot Point Provincial Park, the trails that crisscross Pilot Peninsula are great for early spring walks. Some have been in use for years while others are recent additions from local residents. All provide great views of surrounding peaks, animals and easy hiking. The Waterfront trail can be used to combine canoe and kayaking trips around Crawford Bay and Kootenay Lake.<\/em>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Location:<\/strong>\u00a0east shore Kootenay Lake south of Kootenay Bay ferry.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Difficulty:<\/strong> easy A1<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Elevation gain:<\/strong> +140-235 m (460&#8242;)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Distance<\/strong>: TH to Tipi Camp 12.8kms round trip<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Time:<\/strong> 3-5 hours round trip<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Access:<\/strong> Any vehicle<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <strong>Season:<\/strong> Mid-March through November.
