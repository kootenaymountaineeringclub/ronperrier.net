It was a 260-metre, Greek-owned container ship travelling from South Korea to Vancouver.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The seas off the coast of Vancouver Island were heaving and the waves were five to six metres high as the wind ripped along at 35 knots. The sheltered waters of Juan de Fuca Strait, just 80 kilometres away, were worlds calmer, and safer. It could have come inside the strait as it awaited its scheduled unloading at the port in Vancouver.<br \/>\nZim Kingston\u2019s captain acted as though there was trouble on board.\u00a0 He contacted the Canadian Coast Guard saying it was nearing the mouth of the strait, ready to come in. Then he veered north and kept skulking along outside the strait for 20 hours. Some shipping experts are zeroing in on the hazardous chemical, potassium amyl xanthate, used in mining, which ignites when it contacts wet air. It makes sense to stay at sea if a substance that hot is at play on a storm-wracked ship. The last thing you want is an explosion in the harbour.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Rather than continuing to those sheltered waters, it zig-zagged in the windswept open ocean. The deck had keeled at a 35-degree angle. Capable of carrying 4,253 of the 20-foot containers (about six metres), the boat tilted perilously, and 109 of these metal boxes slipped into the ocean.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It eventually made it into the strait to more protected waters at Constance Bank, approximately 7 kilometres south of Victoria.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A GPS data buoy was deployed near the floating containers to mark their position as they drifted northwest off the west coast of Vancouver Island. Due to high winds and seas, no recovery was attempted then and for the next 10 days.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">On October 23, 2021, 10 damaged containers on the deck caught fire. There were 52 tonnes of xanthate on board. As the\u00a0Zim Kingston\u00a0finally limped inside the strait to anchor off Victoria,\u00a0its load was jostled and the storm was still raging. The xanthate burst into flames. The blaze could not be snuffed out with water. It was completely suppressed by Oct 27.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Four containers washed ashore near Cape Scott. Other than these initial four, no other containers have been found. They are not water-tight and would have been in heavy seas.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Contents include Christmas decorations, sofas, poker tables, metal car parts, clothing, toys, (including inflatable pink plastic unicorns), yoga mats, stand-up paddle boards, and industrial parts. Soon, during high tides, the foam on water lapping Cape Scott Provincial Park was viscous, \u201clike Jello,\u201d it was so thick with shampoo and baby lotion.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Only two containers with hazardous chemicals went overboard. The two chemicals of concern on the M\/V Zim Kingston were potassium amyl xanthate and thiourea dioxide. Both have a very low risk of poisoning or toxicity.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">By October 31, 71 refrigerators, 81 bags of Styrofoam, 19 bags of garbage, and 11 helicopter bags of garbage were flown off Cape Palmerston beach just south of San Josef Bay. Guise Bay was another cleanup priority. The four containers once empty were cut up and airlifted from each site.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There are 105 more shipping containers at large, two of them containing the volatile xanthate, and as the seas pound at their walls and rust their latches, it\u2019s likely that each one will disgorge its contents. With every tide and every storm, more debris comes in.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Debris from the\u00a0Zim Kingston\u00a0continues to wash in including disposable gray urinal mats, kids\u2019 bike helmets, pink plastic unicorns, and salted prawn tips (being eaten by wolves).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Also seen is unusual hockey equipment made out of special stuff to make it lighter from the Hansa Carrier, a ship that lost 21 containers off the coast of B.C. in 1990. This is a reminder of how long the debris dumped by the Zim Kingston will be with us.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">M\/V Zim Kingston is owned by Greece-based Danaos Shipping Company Ltd. Danaos hired Resolve Marine Group to carry out local salvage operations and fire suppression. The responsible person or spiller is legally required to clean up or manage the clean-up of a spill.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><b>ONE Apus<\/b> was a container ship that in 2020 lost approximately 1,816 containers overboard in the Pacific Ocean, the largest loss of containers in transport since 2013. 64 had dangerous goods. Debris from this spill appears on Vancouver Island beaches.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Built in 2019 and measuring 364 meters long, it was\u00a0operated by Japan&#8217;s\u00a0Ocean Network Express, sailing under the Japanese flag. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Sailing from Yantian, Shenzhen, to\u00a0Long Beach, California, it encountered severe weather approximately 1,600 nautical miles (3,000 km) northwest of Hawaii.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup> Heavy rolling seas were caused by Beaufort force 4 winds, north-westerly seas of 5 to 6 meters, a &#8220;long high swell&#8221; and wave heights of up to 16 meters. The ship arrived at Kobe, Japan, on 8 December, where it offloaded nearly 1000 damaged containers, and resumed its voyage on 16 March 2021.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The cause of the accident probably involved a combination of factors, including the weather conditions, the ship&#8217;s rolling behaviour, and the inherent hazards of eight-high on-deck container stowage.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>\u00a0One contributor to the accident could be parametric roll resonance,<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>\u00a0a hazard known to affect container ships.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>The cargo loss cost is estimated at $90 million.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup> The ship was delayed for approximately three months.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">During the COVID-19 pandemic, everyone was stuck at home and ordering doodads off Amazon. As a result, container ships were busier than ever. The industry made US$25 billion in profits in 2020, but over US$150 billion in 2022. Retailers like Wal-Mart were chartering their own ships to keep up with demand. Ships\u2019 dock appointments are ever-changing and many container vessels were anchored outside ports waiting days to unload.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Questions exist about how well the containers, often called \u201csea cans,\u201d are lashed down. Was the declared weight for those containers right, or was the load off balance? Were labels describing the containers\u2019 content accurate or fraudulent?\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Container ships transport about 90 percent of all consumer products worldwide. Between 2008 and 2019, an average of 1,382 containers were lost at sea each year. In 2022, more than 3,000 were lost.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The planet\u2019s largest insurer of ships \u2014 Gard, of Norway \u2014 estimates that in 2020, there was one fire involving containerized cargo every two weeks. The blazes happen partly because, as they carry our lawnmowers, toothbrushes, dog toys and spatulas, container ships also transport a wide array of hazardous chemicals. \u201cDangerous goods\u201d account for about 11 percent of all boxes shipped in containerized cargo and many are flammable. Calcium hypochlorite, used for bleaching paper and disinfecting swimming pools, has caused severe deck fires. In 2019, 13 containers of that substance exploded aboard the ship KMTC Hong Kong as it sat in a port in Thailand. Noxious smoke and acidic ashes rained on nearby villages. Over 130 people went to the hospital, gasping for breath as their skin tingled and burned.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cNurdles\u201d are lentil-sized plastic pellets that, in molten form, can be shaped into consumer products, and are almost constantly trickling into the ocean. In 2016, a British consulting firm, Eunomia, estimated that over 200,000 tonnes of nurdles pollute the marine environment each year.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Fish eat nurdles, which look like their food, and humans, in turn, eat the contaminated fish. Nurdles, meanwhile, are both rafts for E. coli and cholera and sponges for toxins such as PCBs. After the\u00a0X-Press Pearl\u00a0spill, on some Sri Lankan beaches, the nurdles were\u00a0two metres deep.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Still, Sri Lanka was in a way lucky. The X-Press Pearl is, relative to most cargo ships, tiny. It can carry just 2,756 containers. Along with the Zim Kingston, which was not known to be carrying nurdles, it\u2019s a bit player in an industry that has been steadily supersizing its vessels for over a half-century. In 1968, when the twenty-foot container first became an industry standard, the world\u2019s largest ship could carry 1,530 of them. Today, 12 ships can accommodate 24,000 containers, and Canada has eagerly joined the jumboization party.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In 2020, the Port of Halifax completed a $38 million expansion project that, last May enabled it to welcome the biggest ship ever to enter Canada, the Marco Polo \u2014 nearly three Canadian football fields long and capable of hauling 16,022 containers.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In storms, container ships often lapse into rolling where the ship pitches, or moves up and down like a teeter-totter, in powerful waves, causing stacked sea cans to catapult into the ocean.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">On the largest vessels, sea cans are piled some 40 metres above the waterline, when the ship starts to move with the motions of the sea, \u201cyou do not have to be a physicist to understand that the container stacks will be subject to great forces.\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The spills now plaguing our oceans are due in part to climate change, which is making storms ever more volatile. The industry is largely unregulated with the leverage to keep it that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Shipping\u2019s governing body is a United Nations agency that the\u00a0New York Times last year described as \u201cclubby\u201d and \u201csecretive.\u201d The International Maritime Organization includes 175 member states and grants a single vote to each state. It is the only UN agency where corporate players represent countries &#8211; one in four comes from the shipping industry. Last September a climate-focused publication, DeSmog, revealed that, throughout the 2010s, the Cook Islands\u2019 ambassador to the International Maritime Organization, Ian Finley, was paid $700,000 by a lobby group that advocates for chemical tankers \u2014 the International Parcel Tankers Association. As his cheques rolled in, Finley vociferously fought greenhouse gas emission targets for shippers. It forbids journalists from quoting delegates at meetings without their permission. Megan Darby, of the website\u00a0Climate Home News, was suspended from meetings after she used Finley\u2019s \u201cleft field\u201d quote in a story.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But in the view of many observers, the maritime organization\u2019s climate policy remains retrograde. The shipping industry, which is not bound by the Paris Climate Accords, is still partly powered by \u201cheavy fuel oil,\u201d cheap, viscous stuff that\u2019s essentially the dregs of the refining process and as thick as peanut butter when it\u2019s cold.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The\u00a0Ever Ace\u00a0is the largest container ship in the world, capable of carrying nearly 24,000 shipping containers. Its slightly smaller sister ship, the\u00a0Ever Given, became famous after getting stuck and blocking the Suez Canal for six days in March 2021.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The shipping industry causes three percent of all global emissions \u2014 more than all the airlines worldwide. While most ships are owned by wealthy nations \u2014 European countries, the U.S., South Korea and Japan, 96 percent of EU-owned ships were registered in less affluent countries.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">While the Zim Kingston bears the flag of Malta, Comoros and Palau are currently the most popular flags of convenience. Both these tiny island nations \u201cbarely enforce environmental regulations and requirements for labour conditions for seafarers.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Gord Johns, the NDP MP for Courtenay\u2014Alberni on Vancouver Island. In 2018, a national strategy to combat plastic pollution in and around aquatic environments passed unanimously. In the wake of the\u00a0Zim Kingston\u00a0spill, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, which oversees the Coast Guard, failed to honour the resolve expressed in that unanimous vote.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Danaos, the ship\u2019s owner dismantled the four beached shipping containers, and roughly 30 workers spent a month clearing 47 tonnes of debris from beaches.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But the cleanup did not begin until a week after the spill and the department didn\u2019t let local environmental groups take part. Danaos is largely off the hook for the 105 sea cans still missing.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Johns is urging Fisheries and Oceans to establish an emergency coastal debris spill response plan. He also wants the department to hold shipping companies financially liable for all cleanup costs, even if spilled debris keeps washing up for years. Typically, shippers are, like Danaos, held accountable only for the first gush of litter. Shipping firms should pay port fees earmarked for an ongoing cleanup fund.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Furnish a manifest of all missing cargo. Containers on ships are frequently mislabelled. Dangerous-goods containers are mislabelled purposedly.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It\u2019s tragic how humans have become dependent on all this stuff we don\u2019t even need.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>M\/V Zim Kingston.
