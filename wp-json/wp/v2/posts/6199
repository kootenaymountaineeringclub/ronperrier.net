Until recently, half its floorspace was devoted to exhibits about Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, who was president when she opened the museum in 2011, and her late husband, N\u00e9stor Kirchner, who preceded her in office. On display were Kirchner\u2019s trademark loafers and a football shirt emblazoned with the legend \u201c100% K\u201d. Founding fathers like Domingo Sarmiento, Argentina\u2019s seventh president, were \u201cpractically non-existent\u201d says Luciano de Privitellio, director of cultural programmes at the Casa Rosada.<\/p>\n<p>On the orders of Ms Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s recently elected successor, Mauricio Macri, the museum has undergone a seven-week overhaul; it reopened on June 28th. Mr Privitellio claims it is now more even-handed. All of Argentina\u2019s former presidents, including brutal 20th-century dictators, are represented with paintings, video screens and artefacts (Sarmiento\u2019s desk and the dinner jacket of Carlos Menem, for example). \u201cYou can\u2019t leave out the ones you don\u2019t like,\u201d says Mr Privitellio.<\/p>\n<p>The rearrangement is part of a broader effort to banish the soft cult of personality that Ms Fern\u00e1ndez had created around herself and her husband, who died in 2010. It\u2019s a big job\u2014166 public spaces are named after Kirchner, according to Clar\u00edn, a newspaper. His body lies in a three-storey cement mausoleum in R\u00edo Gallegos, in the province of Santa Cruz, which he governed. Visitors can look down reverentially upon his coffin, an idea borrowed from Napoleon\u2019s tomb. Last year Ms Fern\u00e1ndez inaugurated the N\u00e9stor Kirchner Cultural Centre (CCK), housed in a palace in Buenos Aires that once served as the headquarters of the post office.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than knocking the monuments down, the government is changing their purpose. It dropped the idea of renaming the CCK, but closed its \u201cN\u00e9stor Kirchner experience\u201d, an exhibition that extolled the late president\u2019s deeds. A marble image of Kirchner, unveiled by Ms Fern\u00e1ndez at the entrance to the Casa Rosada on her last day in office, has joined the chronologically arranged row of presidential busts (from which the dictators have been culled).<\/p>\n<p>The downgrading extends to figures venerated by the populist Peronist movement, founded by the mid-20th-century strongman Juan Per\u00f3n, to which the Kirchners belong. Mr Privitellio has removed portraits and photographs of 43 leftist luminaries, including Che Guevara and Venezuela\u2019s Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. Especially painful to Ms Fern\u00e1ndez must be the desanctifying of Eva \u201cEvita\u201d Per\u00f3n, Juan\u2019s popular wife, who died young. Her image, etched on 100-peso notes since 2012, is to be replaced next year by that of a Taruca, an Andean deer.<\/p>\n<p>Kirchneristas detect authoritarian impulses behind the restoration of dictators\u2019 portraits and the removal of leftist imagery. They accuse Mr Macri of erasing the Kirchners from history in order to write his own version. If his government \u201ccould ban the letter K from the alphabet, they would\u201d, Ms Fern\u00e1ndez fumed.<\/p>\n<p>Argentines will not soon put back the symbols that Mr Macri is taking down. Ms Fern\u00e1ndez and her coterie have been at the centre of corruption scandals since she left office. On June 14th Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez, a former public-works minister, was caught by police hurling nearly $9m in cash over the wall of a convent, apparently intending to bury it on the convent\u2019s grounds. Ms Fern\u00e1ndez says this has nothing to do with her, but nearly 64% of Argentines doubt that, according to a recent poll. No one has written a musical about Ms Fern\u00e1ndez, but she is in no danger of being forgotten.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The new president puts his predecessor in her place Economist Jul 2nd 2016 Wedged behind the Casa Rosada, Argentina\u2019s presidential palace, the Museo del Bicentenario (bicentenary museum) tells the story of the country\u2019s leaders since the revolution against Spanish rule &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2017\/05\/25\/argintina-kirchner-cult\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-6199","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-uncategorized"],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p2Ncip-1BZ","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6199","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6199"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6199\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6199"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6199"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6199"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
