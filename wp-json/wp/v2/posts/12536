The area controlled by the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR)\u2014known as the Free Zone or Liberated Territories\u2014is of interest to those interested in the political conflict.<\/h3>\n<p>Currency: Moroccan dirham (MAD)<br \/>\nPopulation: 553,000<br \/>\nCountry Code: +212<\/p>\n<p>While there is a long coastline, much of it is rocky and not fit for beaches or travel. Large-scale fishing and ports are at\u00a0Ad Dakhla. Much of the territory is arid desert.<br \/>\nThe Free Zone of Western Sahara, the area to the immediate east of the sand wall (also known as &#8220;the berm&#8221;) was peppered by land mines and should be considered off-limits to any traveler: the territory had one of the highest concentrations of land mines in the world and even where warning signs were posted, most are gone due to the weather. The SADR destroyed its landmines several years ago but some may remain. The Moroccan side of the wall still contains thousands of mines and is extremely dangerous. Furthermore, the Free Zone has almost no roads, so profound navigation experience and a 4\u00d74 with high ground clearance is required. The gates in the berm, which can be used by UN patrols, are not open to regular travelers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HISTORY<\/strong><br \/>\nUnder Spanish rule, as Spanish Sahara, the territory was divided by Spain into two administrative regions: the northern strip, known as\u00a0Saguia el-Hamra, and the southern two-thirds, named\u00a0R\u00edo de Oro.<br \/>\nMorocco\u00a0occupied and annexed the northern two-thirds of Spanish Sahara in 1976, while the rest was annexed by Mauritania. When Mauritania withdrew in 1979, Morocco annexed the southern portion of the territory. A guerrilla war with the Polisario Front liberation movement contesting\u00a0Rabat&#8217;s sovereignty ended in a 1991 cease-fire. A referendum on final status has been repeatedly postponed; a sticking point regarding any potential referendum is who would get to vote.<\/p>\n<p>The Polisario declared the\u00a0<b>Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic<\/b>\u00a0(SADR) in 1976, but the country has only been recognized by around 28 states and has control over only a largely uninhabited eastern slice of territory. Entry into this portion is only possible through\u00a0Algeria.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-h2section\">\n<div class=\"mw-h3section\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><span id=\"Political_situation_on_the_Moroccan_side\" class=\"mw-headline\">Political situation on the Moroccan side.\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>The Moroccan name for Western Sahara is &#8220;Southern Provinces&#8221;; calling it &#8220;Western Sahara&#8221; can get one&#8217;s political position questioned, and people who don&#8217;t share the Moroccan government&#8217;s position can be deported and banned from re-entering Western Sahara. The safest and most hassle-free way of traveling this area is to ignore politics completely.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Unlike in other parts of Morocco, checkpoints on the road are to be taken very seriously:\u00a0<i>always<\/i>\u00a0come to a full stop unless explicitly motioned to move on. Travel plans communicated at the last checkpoint should not be changed spontaneously: travelers sometimes are tracked pretty well, and if you show up in a different place than the one on the your itinerary, questions can be asked.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Moroccan officials are very wary of journalists and humanitarian aid workers due to a perceived interference with what they consider purely Moroccan matters. It is strongly advised that you not mention a profession even remotely related to those. This is also true for the immigration forms filled out when entering Morocco\u2014officials at every checkpoint can retrieve that data via phone and they sometimes do this.<\/span><\/h3>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-h3section\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><span id=\"People\" class=\"mw-headline\">People.\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>Western Sahara&#8217;s inhabitants, known as\u00a0<b>Sahrawis<\/b>, are of Arab and Berber ethnicity and speak the Hass\u0101n\u012bya dialect of Arabic. They are hospitable and known for their elaborate tea ceremonies.<\/span><\/h3>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-h3section\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><span id=\"Economy\" class=\"mw-headline\">Economy.\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>Western Sahara depends on pastoral nomadism, fishing, and phosphate mining as the principal sources of income for the population. The territory lacks sufficient rainfall for sustainable agricultural production, and most of the food for the urban population must be imported. Virtually all trade and other economic activities are controlled by the Moroccan government. Moroccan energy interests in 2001 signed contracts to explore for oil off the coast of Western Sahara, a move that has angered Polisario and international observers. Incomes and standards of living in Western Sahara are substantially below the Moroccan level. Basic food items and gas are subsidized by the Moroccan government.<\/span><\/h3>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-h3section\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><span id=\"Climate\" class=\"mw-headline\">Climate.\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>Western Sahara is a hot, dry desert; consequently, rain is rare, but flash floods occasionally occur. Cold offshore air currents produce fog and heavy dew. There is very little water in the ground. This coupled with a lack of water vapor in the air, which in other regions acts as a greenhouse gas, allows daytime heat to be lost very rapidly into space via infrared radiation. The result is harsh cold nights, despite the very high daytime temperatures. Along most of the coastline, thick fog can form in the early morning hours and reduce visibility until noon considerably.<\/span><\/h3>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-h3section\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><span id=\"Landscapes\" class=\"mw-headline\">Landscapes.\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>Mostly low, flat desert, with large areas of rocky or sandy surfaces rising to small mountains in south and northeast. Low-lying sand dunes cover the territory.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">If you are traveling overland, you will find no border formalities between Morocco and Western Sahara. Your passport may be asked for at the many checkpoints on the road south, but will not be stamped, as the Moroccan authorities regard the Western Sahara as part of Morocco.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>GET IN<\/strong> <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The vast majority of Western Sahara is administered by<\/span>\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Morocco<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">, which considers it an integral part of its territory, so the same entry conditions apply as for the rest of Morocco. However, independent travel in the region is restricted. While crossing through Western Sahara while traveling overland between Morocco and\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Mauritania<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">\u00a0is usually OK, some travelers have been turned back when trying to enter, especially during periods of political strife.

Continuing onwards to Al-Mahbes was denied by local authorities with reference to the frequent military operations, landmines and general security concerns. Al-Mahbes is relatively close to Tindouf, the Polisario&#8217;s headquarter and the refugee camps, which possibly renders the region sensitive in the view of the Moroccan military. Moreover, this region is rumored to be possibly part of the operational area of Al-Qaeda in Magreb.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">From the\u00a0<b>south<\/b>: Entering Western-Sahara from the south (Mauritania) involves passing through a few kilometers of no-man&#8217;s land, which is notorious for its landmines, bandits, false guides offering to guide you through the strip. Only attempt this passage in full daylight and with either a reliable guide, or much more practical, in a convoy\u2014just talk to some truckers at the border. Do not be misled by the old tarmac road which you will cross: this is the so-called &#8220;Spanish Road&#8221;, which dates back to the era of Spanish Sahara (before 1975) and in both direction only leads to impassable sand dunes and minefields. Only a few meters of this road are still being in use today, which are close to the Mauritanian Border Post. Do not venture on this road any further than this. Deadly incidents have continued to occur over the last years as result of falsely interpreting the Spanish Road as the right track.<br \/>\n<strong>By bike.<\/strong> There is a bike route by the coast, from Guelmin in Morocco via Western Sahara and Mauritania to Saint Louis in Senegal.

Though there are some precautions one should take:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Always refuel before any longer stretch on the road. That larger town on your map might turn out to be a small village without a gas station. Especially south of\u00a0Tan-Tan, settlements are few and far between.<br \/>\nThe road&#8217;s condition changes from &#8220;awesome&#8221; to &#8220;abysmal&#8221;, often without warning and sometimes every few kilometers. Don&#8217;t follow the guy who overtakes you with 150\u00a0km\/h (93\u00a0mph)\u2014you might meet him later anyway, with a broken axle, a good 100 m off the road. Don&#8217;t even trust your own experience on a road\u2014a single night of rain can turn a great road into a terrible one.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">When going off-road, either\u00a0<b>know<\/b>\u00a0that the area is free of mines or have a reliable guide.

Though, be aware, the tea is really strong, even for people used to high caffeine intake.<\/p>\n<p><strong>STAY SAFE<\/strong><br \/>\nHot, dry, dust-and-sand-laden sirocco wind can occur during winter and spring; widespread harmattan haze exists 60% of time, often severely restricting visibility. There are low-level uprisings and political violence which is altogether rare, but can escalate. Occupying powers are likely to evict foreigners in such case.<br \/>\nThe N1\u2014and even more so the roads into the heart of the territory\u2014are very remote roads, with facilities and settlements being easily 150\u2013200\u00a0km (93\u2013124\u00a0mi) away from each other. Take enough fuel (always refuel before going on the next leg, you never know what is going to happen) and enough water (several liters per person). Mobile network connection exists along N1.<br \/>\n<span id=\"Landmines_and_unexploded_ordnance_(UXO)\" class=\"mw-headline\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Landmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO)<\/strong>.\u00a0<\/span>There was war in Western Sahara for over 15 years in the 1970s and 1980s, and as a result, the landmine and UXO situation to this day remains quite unclear, despite efforts of the Moroccan Government to improve the situation. There are landmines\u00a0<i>not only<\/i>\u00a0in the remote parts of the country close to berm, but all the way down main coastal road (N1) to the Mauritanian border. Google Earth clearly shows the efforts to clear minefields all along N1, which continue to this day\u2014despite Moroccan officers tending to tell tourists that this part of the country is safe. Around the settlements (Boujdour, Ad-Dakhla, Golfe de Cintra) the situation seems to be slightly worse, possibly due their strategic significance in the war. The warning signs are sometimes so rusty that they can&#8217;t be recognised anymore, but usually the combination of two small metal signs is a strong indicator.<br \/>\nKeep eyes open to lines of stones, cairns, staples of old tyres and similar man-made marking\u2014they are usually meaningful! Generally, any place off the tarmac-road of N1 and off-branching tarmac roads must be considered unsafe. Car-wrecks are strong indicators\u2014do not explore these! Strategically significant points (the various small passes, narrow valleys, elevated points, etc.) are more dangerous, but this does not mean that other places are safe. Any man-made fortifications (straight sand-walls, round sand-wall [for artillery] and any other military looking movements of ground) pose particular danger (esp. south of Ad-Dakhla, but also south of Boujdour). It might be that these were mined when being abandoned to prevent them from falling into the other party&#8217;s hand, or it might be that the surroundings were mined from the beginning to protect against guerrilla attacks, but anyway the mine-cleaning patterns strongly indicate that such places were and possibly continue to be particularly dangerous. Few to no mine-clearing efforts can be observed off the N1 &#8211; that possibly means that (e.g. for lack of touristic significance) these areas continue to be mined and efforts were focussed at the immediate surrounding of N1.<br \/>\nThe patterns of cleaning mine-fields indicate that in not all cases does the Moroccan Government seem to be aware of the location of minefields, which requires more or less random search pattern. Moreover, on Google Earth it can be seen that where minefields have previously been cleared, new clearing activities have resumed later. This again indicates that even traces of cleared minefields do not guarantee safety. This includes the surroundings of the lagoon of Ad-Dakhla, including the lands north of it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HEALTH<\/strong><br \/>\nNo matter whether you travel in a private car or on a bus, always take enough water for at least 24 hours to be prepared if the vehicle breaks down.<br \/>\nDon&#8217;t touch unknown vegetation\u2014some of the seemingly good looking fruit one can find on the road side are poisonous even when just touched (one looks like miniature water melons, another like small cucumbers).<br \/>\nWhen climbing some of the rare stone formations, be aware of scorpions.
