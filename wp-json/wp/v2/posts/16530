In Asuncion I either had to have an antigen test or past positive PCR to board the flight. At Brazil, despite the IATA advice that one needed a Covid antigen or PCR or a positive test (with 2 negative PCRs and a letter from a Dr stating recovery), all that was asked for was proof of vaccination. This is exactly the same as when I entered Brazil from French Guiana in January (one wastes a lot of money with all the conflicting advice). \u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>I had decided to go to Rio to avoid Carnival that started on April 20. I thought that accommodation would be impossible to obtain and I am really not into the big party. \u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>At Sao Paulo this entailed changing airports, from Guaduhos to Congonhas, a 35-km journey across Sao Paulo. The airport information guide said that Latam offered a free shuttle every hour leaving from Terminal 2 and 3 at Guaduhos. But it only existed every 6 hours and only from Terminal 2 (a 20-walk from terminal 3 where I arrived &#8211; exit the terminal and go to the bus station across the road). I got there at 21:45 with the next one at midnight. <\/em><br \/>\n<em>Airport Bus Service had trips every 30 minutes for 35.90 BR (about $10). I had forgotten how unilingual the Brazilians are \u2013 basically zero speak English. I took a long time to find out that I could pay by credit card. There really was no rush as my flight didn\u2019t leave till 06:25 but I wanted to try to get some sleep without being interrupted by a bus ride. The huge bus was basically empty with 4 passengers.<\/em><br \/>\n<em>I still had a Brazilian SIM card in my phone from my first stop and only needed a top up.

Museums.<\/strong> The vast majority are free if over 60. The few that aren&#8217;t are half price.<br \/>\n<strong>2. Food.<\/strong> Some of the usual US restaurants are here (BK, McDonald&#8217;s, Subway) but much more common is Bob&#8217;s &#8211; generally for very good milkshakes but also hamburgers and typical fast food. Prices are very competitive.<br \/>\nHowever, I consider bus stop food atrocious. Most are deep-fried pastries with many different stuffings. The stops along the routes are large buffets with food that makes me gag. Coffee is about all I buy. There are never reasonable things like yogurt or milk, only chips, and pop. Some of the very large stations have Subway and Bob&#8217;s.<br \/>\nThe stations are patrolled by many security people who enforce rules rigorously because they have so little to do.<br \/>\n<strong>3. Language.<\/strong> The Portuguese spoken here is apparently hard to understand for those from Portugal. Few speak English. The accent and some letter pronunciations are quite different from Spanish. Brazilians are completely intolerant of incorrect pronunciation and accentuation of syllables. From my point of view, it is completely useless to even try.<br \/>\n<strong>4. Getting Around.<\/strong> The bus system is superb with many companies and every destination covered. The stations are called rodoviarias. I use Google translate and get tickets for what I want quickly. The prices are very reasonable. I try to get bed seats for long trips, especially overnight ones. I had one that reclined completely flat with only 6 seats in the entire bottom of the bus.<br \/>\nTaxis are expensive so I rely heavily on Uber which is quite cheap and the app brilliant.<br \/>\nCity buses can be a challenge. Determining the destination is difficult. The stops are also very confusing with most buses stopping only at their specific stop.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Day 1 &amp; 3<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/span><em>I have combined Days 1 and 3 as they are in the same area and direction.\u00a0<\/em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/span><strong>RIO de JANEIRO<br \/>\n<\/strong><em>It was only about 2 km from the airport to my hostel.

At first, neighbours mocked him for his choice of colours as he covered the steps in fragments of blue, green, and yellow tiles \u2013 the colours of the Brazilian flag. It started out as a side-project to his main passion, painting, but soon became an obsession. He found he was constantly out of money, so Selar\u00f3n sold paintings to fund his work. It was long and exhausting work but he continued on and eventually covered the entire set of steps in tiles, ceramics, and mirrors.<br \/>\nRunning from Joaquim Silva street and Pinto Martins street, the steps straddle the\u00a0Lapa\u00a0and\u00a0Santa Teresa\u00a0neighbourhoods.\u00a0There are 215 steps measuring 125 metres long, which are covered in over 2000 tiles collected from over 60 countries around the world.<sup id=\"cite_ref-autogenerated1_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>\u00a0No sooner than one section of the steps was &#8216;finished&#8217;, Selar\u00f3n started work on another section, constantly changing it so that it was an ever-evolving piece of art.<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-autogenerated1_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>Originally, tiles for the work were scavenged from various construction sites and piles of urban waste found on the Rio streets.

This\u00a0is a\u00a0site\u00a0located in the\u00a0Barra de Guaratiba\u00a0neighborhood , in\u00a0the West Zone\u00a0of\u00a0Rio de Janeiro.\u00a0The name of the site is a tribute to\u00a0Roberto Burle Marx, an internationally renowned Brazilian artist and landscaper, who resided at the site from 1973 until his death on June 4, 1994. Burle Marx acquired the property, originally named\u00a0<i>S\u00edtio Santo Ant\u00f4nio da Bica<\/i>, together with his brother Siegfried Marx in 1949. The site was donated by Burle Marx to\u00a0IPHAN\u00a0in 1985, the same year that the site was recognized as a Brazilian\u00a0cultural heritage.<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-IPHAN_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>The site covers an area of \u200b\u200bover 400,000 m\u00b2, where one of the most important collections of tropical and semitropical plants in the world is located, starting when\u00a0Roberto Burle Marx\u00a0was six years old.\u00a0Grown in gardens and outdoor nurseries, the collection comprises more than 3,500 plant species, including unique specimens from the\u00a0<i>Araceae<\/i>\u00a0,\u00a0<i>Arecaceae<\/i>,\u00a0<i>Bromeliaceae<\/i>,\u00a0<i>Cycadaceae<\/i>,\u00a0<i>Heliconiaceae<\/i>,\u00a0<i>Marantaceae,<\/i>\u00a0and\u00a0<i>Velloziaceae<\/i>\u00a0families.\u00a0This set of live plants was perfectly adapted to the usual nature of the site, composed of\u00a0mangroves, restinga, and\u00a0Atlantic Forest.<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>On the site, there was originally an old farmhouse and a small chapel from\u00a0the 17th century\u00a0dedicated to\u00a0Santo Ant\u00f4nio de Lisboa\u00a0, buildings that were later restored, and the house became the residence of\u00a0Roberto Burle Marx\u00a0in 1973. After the landscaper&#8217;s death, his residence became\u00a0<i>Burle Marx&#8217;s House-Museum<\/i>\u00a0in August 1999. In addition to the original environments and objects for personal use, the House Museum displays art and handicraft objects acquired by Burle Marx throughout his life.\u00a0The house&#8217;s collection has more than 3,000 items, including works by Roberto himself who, in addition to being a landscaper, was also a painter, draftsman, designer, sculptor, and singer<br \/>\nIt was quite a chore getting here, taking almost 2 hours. I took the metro to Jardim Oceanica, the end of the line, then the BRT (Bus Rapid Transit), transferring at the large Barra station and getting off at\u00a0Guaratiba. I then walked 1.5 km to the site.<br \/>\nNote that it is seen by a guided tour and closes at 15:30.
