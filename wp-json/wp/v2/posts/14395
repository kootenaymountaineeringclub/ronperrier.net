The highest dunes are 20-60 m high in the unstable area of dunes on the east end. There is evidence of human habitation dating from 2000 years ago \u2013 19 skeletons and pottery have been discovered.

The road is well designed to handle rain and water by being domes slightly in the centre. There was little washboarding and potholes only when crossing streams in the low areas. The road climbs up over a pass and then descends to a river. Many Tongans were swimming in the rivers passed. The steep sections have pavement. Come to a T \u2013 turn right for Sovi Basin and left, 12 km to the waterfall. This much smoother road passes several villages \u2013 Narukumbua, Nashatoka, a Catholic school and finally Namosi.

The town and its low line of buildings are set among coconut and mango trees along the beachfront of Ovalau Island against the forested slopes of the island\u2019s extinct volcano. It was the first colonial capital of Fiji, peacefully ceded to the British by Tui (King) Cakobau in 1874. From the 1820s onwards it developed as a centre of commercial activity by Americans and Europeans who built warehouses, stores, port facilities, residences, and religious, educational and social institutions around the villages of the South Pacific island\u2019s indigenous population. It is a rare example of a late colonial urban plan that merges local settlement traditions with colonial standards of supreme naval power in the industrialized stage of colonization, which was based on maritime extraction and export.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A low stone and concrete sea wall runs the length of Beach Street, with streets and lanes branching inland in a radial pattern following the contours of the land. Inland are the sites of two former indigenous villages Totoga (Vitoga) and Nasau located on one of the three creeks draining the slopes above the coastal plain. Copra sheds, warehouses, bond stores, port facilities and commercial buildings developed along Beach Street, and residences, religious, educational and social institutions grew up around the villages of the indigenous population. These are generally single or two-storied corrugated iron or weatherboard-clad timber buildings with hipped or gable roofs.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Development continued after moving the capital to Suva in 1882 as companies continued to establish bases at Levuka. Key elements include the former Cakobau Parliament House site (now the European Memorial), Morris Hedstrom bond store, the Baba indentured labour settlement, the Hennings residence, Captain Robbie\u2019s bungalow, Sacred Heart Cathedral and Presbytery dating from the 1860s, the Royal Hotel founded in the late 1860s, Deed of Cession site, former Government (Nasova) House site, Port Authority, Post and Customs buildings together with their remnant tram tracks to the wharf, former Methodist Church and mission, Levuka Public School, Town Hall, Masonic Lodge, Ovalau Club, Bowling Club, workers cottages and the shell button factory site.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The buildings are remarkably intact, largely due to the attention paid to the town\u2019s historic values since these were first recognized in 1973.
