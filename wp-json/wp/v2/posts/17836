The vast Eastern Zhou empire was cracking apart. A subject kingdom called Qin, occupying much of modern-day Shaanxi Province, rose to power. It pushed new roads across the 12,000-foot Qin Mountains to attack a wealthy southern rival\u2014the kingdom of Shu\u2014centered in today\u2019s Sichuan. Rich in salt, silk and iron, Shu expanded its own roads to better defend its mountain frontiers. But Shu lost in 316 B.C. And all these stone-paved roads, improved with post offices and caravan stops, became arteries of imperial integration. This was when China\u2019s center of gravity lay in the highlands of the west, and not (as today) in the hot, low plains and cities of the east.<\/p>\n<p>A hundred generations of traders commuted along the Shu Roads. They pushed \u201cwooden oxen\u201d\u2014wheelbarrows. Armies fitted in leather armor marched atop the branching network of flagstones. Sometimes, they torched wooden sections of the road\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/figure\/Reconstructed-Plank-Road-at-Mingyue-Gorge-in-Northern-Sichuan_fig1_242150405\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">miles of extraordinary plank walkways<\/a>\u00a0suspended from canyon walls\u2014as they retreated. Farmers hustled their goods along the roads.

Poets and sages walked the roads. So did deposed kings, refugees, addled foreigners, and elderly farm women tacking against gravity under bundles of firewood. (A few last of these still walk the trails today.) In China\u2019s relict wild mountains, giant pandas, red pandas, gnu-like takin, and six-foot salamanders also prowl the Shu Roads. Today these weedy paths go mostly nowhere.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--below-paragraph InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\" data-bumper-index=\"3\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/beebd4da-4c99-414f-b0a5-5a212f27e10d\/9-IMG_6438.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=1920\" alt=\"Photo of wooden plank pathway along mountainside and river\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">A reconstruction of plank roads\u2014an engineering feat more than two millennia old\u2014hangs above Mingyue Gorge, in Sichuan Province.\u200b<br id=\"isPasted\" \/><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><span class=\"RichText Caption__Credit\" aria-label=\"Photograph by Paul Salopek\">PHOTOGRAPH BY PAUL SALOPEK<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"EmbedInline\">\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--right InlineElement--desktop\" aria-label=\"markup\">\n<div class=\"static--markup\">\n<div class=\"ng-locator-map ng-locator-map-theme-light\" data-ng-locator-map=\"\" data-ng-locator-map-processed=\"true\">\n<div class=\"ng-locator-map-inner maplibregl-map mapboxgl-map\">\n<div class=\"maplibregl-control-container mapboxgl-control-container\">\n<div class=\"maplibregl-ctrl-bottom-right mapboxgl-ctrl-bottom-right\"><b style=\"font-size: 16px;\">We start our trek<\/b><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">\u00a0in Li\u2019s hometown, Chengdu, the ancient capital of Shu and the southern pole of the Shu Roads.

The bridges are built solidly of stone. The ascents and descents are made by stone stairs. More than a millennium ago an emperor planted cedars at measured distances on both sides, the beautiful red-stemmed, weeping cedar of the province . . . Each tree bears the imperial seal and the district magistrates count them annually.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>They still do.<\/p>\n<p>To locate old Shu Roads, Li and I seek out colonnades of big trees linking village guesthouses and gritty truck stops. They aren\u2019t cedars. They are cypresses\u00a0<i>(Cupressus)<\/i>. A few are 800 or more years old, and each one is tagged by the Sichuan reforestation bureau. In the wet mists of Sichuan their massive black boughs drip their own rain.<\/p>\n<p>Isabella Bird wrote sympathetically of rural Chinese. She did complain about the 19<sup>th-<\/sup>century bureaucracy. Qing Dynasty officials demanded her passport every few miles, she grumbled, copying her particulars on clipboards of slate.
