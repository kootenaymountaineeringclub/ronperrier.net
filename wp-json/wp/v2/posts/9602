Since 2003, the number of tourists has ballooned (190,000 in 2017) and this has made possible the financing of the restoration of the church.<br \/>\nThe chapel was built in the mid-15<sup>th<\/sup> century by William St Clair, the third Earl of Orkney whose home was in Rosslyn Castle. The ornately carved interior \u2013 at odds with the architecture of the time \u2013 is a monument to the mason\u2019s art, rich in symbolic imagery. As well as flowers, vines, angels and biblical figures, the carved stones include many of the pagan \u2018Green Man\u2019 \u2013 an ornate face with plants typically coming from its mouth \u2013 there are supposedly 100 green men in the church. Other figures are associated with Freemasonry and the Knights Templar. Oddly there are also carvings of plants from the Americas \u2013 maize, aloe vera, and \u2013 that predate Columbus\u2019 voyage of discovery.<br \/>\nThe symbolism of these images has led some researchers to conclude that Rosslyn is some kind of secret Templar repository and it has been claimed that hidden vaults beneath the chapel conceal anything from the Holy Grail or the head of John the Baptist to the body of Christ himself.<br \/>\nThe chapel is owned by the Episcopal Church of Scotland and holds regular services. It is on the eastern edge of the village of Rosslyn, 7 miles south of Edinburgh\u2019s center.<br \/>\nThe 10\u00a3 (7 reduced) covers an excellent hourly talk by a guide. The included brochure also has details of most of the significant carvings.<\/p>\n<div class=\"irc_mimg irc_hic iePumYXhoNVM-lvVgf-rIiHk\"><a class=\"irc_mil i3597 iePumYXhoNVM-zixyDjKkw5M\"

existence to Castle Rock, the glacier-worn stump of a long-extinct volcano that provided a near-perfect defensive location guarding the coast against northeast England into central Scotland. In the 7<sup>th<\/sup> century, the rock was called Dun Eiden (Fort on the hill slope). It was captured by invaders from Northumberland in NE England in 638 \u2013 they took the Gaelic name \u2018Eiden\u2019 and tacked it onto their Old English word for fort, \u2018burh\u2019, to create Edinburgh.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"> In the 12<sup>th<\/sup> century, King David changed capitals from Dunfermline to Edinburgh. The first effective wall was constructed in 1450, enclosing the Old Town \u2013 making it the most populous town in Scotland. Overcrowding resulted in tenements 5 and 6 stories high.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"> <em>Reformation<\/em> (1560-1690) was led by the Calvinist firebrand John Knox. Mary, Queen of Scots held court in the Palace of Holyroodhouse for 6 years, but when her son James VI succeeded Elizabeth I to the English throne in 1603, he moved his court to London. The Act of Union in 1707 further reduced Edinburgh\u2019s importance.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"> <em>Scottish Enlightenment<\/em> (1740-1830). Cultural and intellectual life flourished and Edinburgh was a hotbed of \u2018genius\u2019. In the second half of the 18<sup>th<\/sup> century, the New Town was built and in the 19<sup>th<\/sup> century, the population quadrupled to 400,000.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"> In the 1920s, the city\u2019s borders expanded to encompass Leith in the north, Cramond in the west, and the Pentland Hills in the south. Following WWII, cultural life blossomed, stimulated by the Edinburgh International Festival and the Fringe, both held for the first time in 1947 and are now recognized as world-class festivals.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"> After the 1997 referendum in favour of a Scottish Parliament which first convened in 1999 in the modern building at the foot of the Royal Mile. The 2014 independence referendum saw Scots vote to remain part of the UK but the 2107 Brexit vote disappointingly saw the UK leave the European Union (Scotland voted overwhelming to stay).<\/span><\/div>\n<p><strong>OLD TOWN.<\/strong> The Royal Mile extends as its spine between Edinburgh Castle and Holyrood. It descends to the south down Victoria St at Grassmarket as a maze of closes (alleys) and wynds, stairs, and vaults. To the north was Nor\u2019 Loch, now drained and occupied by Princes Street Gardens. Until the founding of New Town, it was overcrowded and unsanitary, forced to expand upwards as the skyscrapers of their day. All classes of society lived cheek by jowl, the wealthy occupying the middle floors \u2013 high enough to be above the noise and stink of the streets, but not so high that climbing the stairs would be so tiring \u2013 while the poor squeezed into attics, basements, cellars, and vaults amid rats, rubbish and raw sewage.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Edinburgh Castle.<\/strong> Sitting on the most easily defended route between England and central Scotland followed by countless armies from Roman legions to the Jacobite troops in 1745. Pass through the Entrance Gateway and Portucullis gate to the cannons ranged along the battlements with views down to New Town. The One O\u2019Clock Gun, a WWII 25-pounder, fires every day at exactly 1 pm.<br \/>\nCurl south through Foog\u2019s Gate to the highest part of the rock at St Margaret\u2019s Chapel, the oldest surviving building in Edinburgh (1130), and Mons Meg, an 1149 giant siege gun.<br \/>\nThe main group of buildings surrounds Crown Square: The Scottish National War Memorial and the Great Hall built for James IV (r 1488-1513) as a ceremonial hall and used as the Scottish Parliament until 1639. Enter the Castle Vaults (used as storerooms, bakeries, and prisons) under the Great Hall via the Prisons of War exhibit. The Royal Palace, on the eastern side of the square, has the strongroom with the crown jewels of Scotland and the Stone of Destiny (a 26.5\u201dx16.5\u201dx11\u201d block of sandstone with rusted iron hoops at both ends had sat for 700 years under the Coronation Chair in Westminster Abbey used to crown almost all monarchs from Edward II in 1307 to Elizabeth II in 1953, is said to have originated in the Holy Land, and was stolen from Scone Abbey near Perth in 1296, but returned to Scotland in 1996). In the Royal Apartments is where Mary Queen of Scots gave birth to her son James VI.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"irc_mil i3597 i1eEROJES6Lw-zixyDjKkw5M\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/chrisradleyphotography.com\/edinburgh-castle\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwiM8fXRh73aAhVCzxQKHVUFC2IQjRx6BAgAEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/chrisradleyphotography.com\/\/pages\/locations\/edinburgh-castle\/edinburgh-castle-1.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for edinburgh castle\" width=\"628\" height=\"418\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Walking Tour of Old Town Alleys.<\/strong> From the castle we walked by Cannonball House, the Witches Well, deviated north to Ramsay Garden and the courtyard of University of Edinburgh\u2019s Faculty of Divinity to see the statue of John Knox, crossed Lawnmarket Street to Riddell\u2019s Court (has the inscription \u2018We live and learn\u2019), turned right to walk along Victoria Terrace and down to Grassmarket with the Covenanters Monument (marks where 100 martyrs were hanged in the 17<sup>th<\/sup> century), and turned east along Cowgate walking under George IV Bridge.

It was only a true cathedral \u2013 the seat of the bishop \u2013 from 1633-38 and 1661-89.
