In the highest uplift of the group, four large ridges, or spurs, branch east from the watershed, a geological structure typical of the Monashees. These are the ridge of Hughes Peak, the ridge east of Gates Peak, the Thor-Niflheim massif (Stegosaurus Ridge), and to the south the Odin-Grady-Burnham ridge. The Thor-Niflheim ridge is spectacular. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">South of the uplift, the mountains are lower and less alpine in character. Blanket Mtn., Cranberry Mtn. and Mount Odin support large ice fields and glaciers. Approaches below the tree line are difficult because of the jungle of undergrowth. Topographical Survey parties were active here in 1911, 1925, 1928, and in the late 1950s under Bryan Boyd. Geological parties under A.G. Jones examined its entire length from 1948 to 1951, and D. B.

It is probably best to cross the meadows well below the glacier to avoid a short overhanging step in the southeast ridge. While climbable, the step would be very trying with a pack. Pass over the col in the northeast ridge (a little glacier travel) and descend into the cirque north of Stegosaurus Ridge (Niflheim Cirque) going down next to a waterfall, or one half km north of the fall, to the flat meadows at 1740 meters. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Take the trail out of the cirque, on the east side of the stream, and descend to the trail on the N side of South Thor Creek, and to the road on the S side of Thor Creek (Killeen Road).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It is best to carry a rope, an ice axe, a few long slings (for trees) and a little protection in case parts of the descent into the Niflheim Cirque become a bit technical, especially with heavy packs, and for the glacier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Access to Niflheim Cirque<\/strong> <strong>(Thor-Niflheim Cirque),<\/strong> <strong>North Side of Stegosaurus Ridge<\/strong><br \/>\n<em><strong>Drive<\/strong>.<\/em> As described above, take a right turn just beyond the Pingston Creek bridge, drive to the end of the road (high clearance) and backpack up the marked trail on the north side of South Thor Creek (the main branch of Thor Creek; difficult to cross).<br \/>\n<em><strong>Route.<\/strong><\/em> Cross South Thor Creek again on a log jam at the lower end of the lake.

Soon after climbing an easy rock outcrop, the markers trend up and right, generally, toward the stream flowing from the Niflheim Cirque in light to medium bush. When a small cliff is seen, the markers lead around its base and the base of a bear den moraine with gigantic boulders. Continue with the markers, well above the stream and sometimes on steep hillside, to the gateway to the cirque, about 6 hours from the end of the road. Bring mosquito repellent. (This trail was recut in 2006.)<br \/>\nLate in the season, parties have traversed the lake shore to the waterfall coming from the cirque, and gone up the west side of the creek.<br \/>\nFrom the road, an undrivable logging road provides access to Mount Thor, Route 1. Ascend into the big clear-cut above, climb to its upper right-hand corner and traverse up and right into the bush. This reaches a large sickle-shaped rock slide that leads to the alpine zone.

Instead, hike south up the valley in the Thor-Niflheim (Niflheim) Cirque (See \u2018Access to Niflheim Cirque\u2019 in the Introduction to the Gold Range.), bear right and enter the avalanche chute that receives icefall from the ice cliff. The ice cliff is not highly active, and the right side (true left side) receives less than its share of the falls. One can use the side of the chute part way. About 200 meters downslope from the final dead-end ice and rock cliffs, turn up and right on an easy, very large ledge system out of the chute, and cross the streams that cascade down the bluffs on a wide, nearly level bench. Above the bluffs lie heather and snow. Crampons are useful.
