Gas.<\/strong>\u00a0The cheapest is about \u20ac1.35\/l, diesel is less than gas, but there are no tolls, so it ends up being a little less than in the UK. Prices vary widely.Avoid Q8 or Total, both very expensive. It gets cheaper close to big cities. I found one associated with a large computer store west of Li\u00e9ge for \u20ac1.34 but that was very unusual has been the cheapest as I head north. Oil is unbelievably expensive at over \u20ac20 per litre!!<br \/>\n<strong>2. Groceries.<\/strong>\u00a0Avoid Carrefore or Markt, a Carrefore subsidiary and try to keep to Aldi and Lidl, both inexpensive but without the most complete selection.<\/p>\n<p><strong>OBSERVATIONS ABOUT BELGIUM<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>1. Bicycles.<\/strong>\u00a0The Netherland has a reputation for bicycles, but this place must be just as bicycle mad. Virtually every road has bike lanes on both sides (usually in red brick or pavement). I am surprised that virtually no one wears a helmet, several rides with headphones (very dangerous), almost all bikes have panniers, a wicker basket, a baby carrier or pulls a baby cart, and the vast majority are clunky-looking, upright handlebar street bikes. The lanes keep them out of the traffic, not like the suicide riders in the UK.<br \/>\nWallonia feels like a totally different country, much more like France with Flanders much more like Holland. Compared to bicycle mad Flanders, you virtually never see a bicycle here except clubs out on mass rides, when they take up the whole road riding several abreast. The bicycle is certainly not part of daily life.<br \/>\n<strong>2. Food.<\/strong>\u00a0Some unusual things are: no fresh milk, only UHT; beef hamburger is not common and then finely ground with no fat, not very good for hamburgers \u2013 a beef\/pork combination is much more common. Carrefour is ridiculously expensive but, like the UK and Ireland, there are Aldi and Lidl stores that offer good savings.<br \/>\n<strong>3. English.<\/strong>\u00a0Everyone speaks good English. I am not sure why the French in Wallonia speak zero English when the rest of Belgium is effectively bilingual. Unfortunately, the museums too are mostly in French.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GENERAL\u00a0<\/strong><br \/>\nBelgium,\u00a0officially the\u00a0Kingdom of Belgium, is a country in\u00a0Western Europe\u00a0bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, and Luxembourg. A small and densely populated country, it covers an area of 30,528 square kilometers (11,787\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and has a population of more than 11\u00a0million.<br \/>\nStraddling the cultural boundary between\u00a0Germanic\u00a0and\u00a0Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly\u00a0Flemish\u00a0community, which constitutes about 59 percent of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly\u00a0Walloon\u00a0population, which comprises about 40 percent of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers, numbering around one percent, who live in the\u00a0East Cantons.<br \/>\nThe capital and largest city is Brussels; other major cities are\u00a0Antwerp,\u00a0Ghent,\u00a0Charleroi, and\u00a0Li\u00e8ge.<br \/>\nHistorically, Belgium was part of an area known as the\u00a0Low Countries, a somewhat larger region than the current\u00a0Benelux\u00a0group of states that also included parts of northern France and western Germany. Its name is derived from the Latin word\u00a0Belgica, after the\u00a0Roman province\u00a0of\u00a0Gallia Belgica.<br \/>\nFrom the end of the\u00a0Middle Ages\u00a0until the 17th century, the area of Belgium was a prosperous and cosmopolitan center of commerce and culture. Between the 16th and early 19th centuries, Belgium served as the battleground between many European powers, earning the moniker the &#8220;Battlefield of Europe&#8221;,\u00a0a reputation strengthened by both\u00a0world wars. The country emerged in 1830 following the\u00a0Belgian Revolution\u00a0when it seceded from the\u00a0Netherlands.<br \/>\nBelgium is a\u00a0federal\u00a0constitutional monarchy\u00a0with a\u00a0parliamentary system\u00a0of governance. It is divided into three highly\u00a0autonomous\u00a0regions\u00a0and three communities: the Dutch-speaking region of\u00a0Flanders\u00a0in the north, the mostly French-speaking\u00a0Wallonia\u00a0region in the south, and the German-speaking cantons in the east. The\u00a0Brussels-Capital Region\u00a0is an officially bilingual (French and Dutch)\u00a0enclave\u00a0within the Flemish Region, though French is the dominant language.\u00a0A\u00a0German-speaking Community\u00a0exists in eastern Wallonia.\u00a0Belgium&#8217;s linguistic diversity and related political conflicts are reflected in its\u00a0political history and\u00a0complex system of governance made up of\u00a0six different governments.<br \/>\nBelgium participated in the\u00a0Industrial Revolution\u00a0and, during the course of the 20th century, possessed\u00a0a number of colonies in Africa.<br \/>\nThe second half of the 20th century was marked by rising tensions between the Dutch-speaking and the French-speaking citizens fueled by\u00a0differences in language and culture and the\u00a0unequal economic development\u00a0of Flanders and Wallonia. This continuing antagonism has led to several\u00a0far-reaching reforms, resulting in a transition from a\u00a0unitary\u00a0to a\u00a0federal\u00a0arrangement during the period from 1970 to 1993. Despite the reforms, tensions between the groups have remained, if not increased; there is significant separatism particularly\u00a0among the Flemish; controversial language laws exist such as the\u00a0municipalities with language facilities;\u00a0and the formation of a coalition government took 18 months following the\u00a0June 2010 federal election, a world record.\u00a0Unemployment in Wallonia is more than double that of Flanders, which boomed after the war.<br \/>\nBelgium is one of the six founding countries of the\u00a0European Union\u00a0and hosts the official seats of the\u00a0European Commission, the\u00a0Council of the European Union, and the\u00a0European Council, as well as a seat of the\u00a0European Parliament\u00a0in the country&#8217;s capital,\u00a0Brussels. Belgium is also a founding member of the\u00a0Eurozone,\u00a0NATO,\u00a0OECD, and\u00a0WTO, and a part of the trilateral Benelux Union and the\u00a0Schengen Area. Brussels hosts several of the EU&#8217;s official seats as well as the headquarters of many major international organizations such as NATO.<br \/>\nBelgium is a\u00a0developed country, with an advanced\u00a0high-income economy. The country achieves very high standards of\u00a0living,\u00a0life quality,\u00a0healthcare,\u00a0education,\u00a0and is categorized as &#8220;very high&#8221; in the\u00a0Human Development Index.\u00a0It also ranks as one of the\u00a0safest or most peaceful countries\u00a0in the world.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HISTORY<br \/>\n<\/strong>Gaul is divided into three parts, one of which the Belgae inhabit, the Aquitani another, those who in their own language are called Celts, in ours Gauls, the third. Of all these, the Belgae are the strongest. \u2014\u00a0Julius Caesar, De Bello Gallico, Book I, Ch. 1<br \/>\nThe name &#8220;Belgium&#8221; is derived from\u00a0Gallia Belgica, a\u00a0Roman province\u00a0in the northernmost part of\u00a0Gaul\u00a0that before the Roman invasion in 100\u00a0BC, was inhabited by the\u00a0Belgae, a mix of\u00a0Celtic\u00a0and\u00a0Germanic peoples. A\u00a0gradual immigration\u00a0by Germanic\u00a0Frankish\u00a0tribes during the 5th century brought the area under the rule of the\u00a0Merovingian\u00a0kings. A gradual shift of power during the 8th century led the kingdom of the Franks to evolve into the\u00a0Carolingian Empire.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Treaty of Verdun\u00a0in 843 divided the region into\u00a0Middle\u00a0and\u00a0West Francia\u00a0and therefore into a set of more or less independent\u00a0fiefdoms\u00a0which, during the\u00a0Middle Ages, were\u00a0vassals of either of the\u00a0King of France\u00a0or of the\u00a0Holy Roman Emperor.<br \/>\nMany of these fiefdoms\u00a0were united in the\u00a0Burgundian Netherlands\u00a0of the 14th and 15th centuries.\u00a0Emperor Charles\u00a0V\u00a0extended the\u00a0personal union\u00a0of the\u00a0Seventeen Provinces\u00a0in the 1540s, making it far more than a personal union by the\u00a0Pragmatic Sanction of 1549\u00a0and increased his influence over the\u00a0Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Eighty Years&#8217; War\u00a0(1568\u20131648) divided the Low Countries into the northern\u00a0United Provinces\u00a0(Belgica Foederata\u00a0in\u00a0Latin, the &#8220;Federated Netherlands&#8221;) and the\u00a0Southern Netherlands\u00a0(Belgica Regia, the &#8220;Royal Netherlands&#8221;). The latter were ruled successively by the\u00a0Spanish\u00a0(Spanish Netherlands) and the\u00a0Austrian\u00a0Habsburgs\u00a0(Austrian Netherlands) and comprised most of modern Belgium. This was the theatre of most\u00a0Franco-Spanish and\u00a0Franco-Austrian wars\u00a0during the 17th and 18th centuries.<br \/>\nFollowing the\u00a0campaigns of 1794 in the French Revolutionary Wars, the Low Countries\u2014including territories that were never nominally under Habsburg rule, such as the Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge\u2014were annexed by the\u00a0French First Republic, ending Austrian rule in the region. The reunification of the Low Countries as the\u00a0United Kingdom of the Netherlands\u00a0occurred at the dissolution of the\u00a0First French Empire\u00a0in 1815, after the defeat of Napoleon.<br \/>\n<strong>Independent Belgium. <\/strong>In 1830, the\u00a0Belgian Revolution\u00a0led to the separation of the Southern Provinces from the Netherlands and to the establishment of a Catholic and bourgeois, officially French-speaking and neutral, independent Belgium under a\u00a0provisional government\u00a0and a\u00a0national congress.\u00a0Since the installation of\u00a0Leopold\u00a0I\u00a0as king on\u00a021 July\u00a01831, now celebrated as Belgium&#8217;s\u00a0National Day, Belgium has been a\u00a0constitutional monarchy\u00a0and\u00a0parliamentary democracy, with a\u00a0laicist\u00a0constitution based on the\u00a0Napoleonic code.<br \/>\nAlthough the franchise was initially restricted,\u00a0universal suffrage\u00a0for men was introduced after the\u00a0general strike of 1893\u00a0(with\u00a0plural voting\u00a0until 1919) and for women in 1949.<br \/>\nThe main political parties of the 19th century were the\u00a0Catholic Party\u00a0and the\u00a0Liberal Party, with the\u00a0Belgian Labour Party\u00a0emerging towards the end of the 19th century. French was originally the single official language adopted by the\u00a0nobility\u00a0and the\u00a0bourgeoisie. It progressively lost its overall importance as Dutch became recognized as well. This recognition became official in 1898 and in 1967 the parliament accepted a Dutch version of the\u00a0Constitution.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Berlin Conference\u00a0of 1885 ceded control of the\u00a0Congo Free State\u00a0to\u00a0King Leopold\u00a0II\u00a0as his private possession. From around 1900 there was a growing international concern for the extreme and savage treatment of the Congolese population under Leopold\u00a0II, for whom the Congo was primarily a source of revenue from ivory and rubber production. Many Congolese were killed by Leopold&#8217;s agents for failing to meet production quotas for ivory and rubber. It is estimated that nearly 10\u00a0million were killed during the Leopold period. In 1908, this outcry led the Belgian state to assume responsibility for the government of the colony, henceforth called the\u00a0Belgian Congo.\u00a0A Belgian commission in 1919 estimated that Congo&#8217;s population was half what it was in 1879.<br \/>\nGermany invaded Belgium in August 1914\u00a0as part of the\u00a0Schlieffen Plan\u00a0to attack\u00a0France, and much of the\u00a0Western Front\u00a0fighting of\u00a0World War I\u00a0occurred in western parts of the country. The opening months of the war were known as the\u00a0Rape of Belgium\u00a0due to German excesses. Belgium assumed control of the\u00a0German colonies\u00a0of\u00a0Ruanda-Urundi\u00a0(modern-day\u00a0Rwanda\u00a0and\u00a0Burundi) during the war, and in 1924 the\u00a0League of Nations\u00a0mandated them to Belgium. In the aftermath of the First World War, Belgium annexed the\u00a0Prussian districts\u00a0of\u00a0Eupen and Malmedy\u00a0in 1925, thereby causing the presence of a German-speaking minority.<br \/>\nGerman forces again invaded the country in May 1940, and 40,690 Belgians, over half of them Jews, were killed during the subsequent\u00a0occupation\u00a0and\u00a0The Holocaust. From September 1944 to February 1945\u00a0the Allies liberated Belgium. After World War\u00a0II,\u00a0a general strike\u00a0forced King\u00a0Leopold\u00a0III\u00a0to abdicate in 1951, since\u00a0many Belgians felt he had collaborated with Germany\u00a0during the war. The Belgian Congo gained independence in 1960 during the\u00a0Congo Crisis; Ruanda-Urundi followed with its independence two years later. Belgium joined\u00a0NATO\u00a0as a founding member and formed the Benelux group of nations with the Netherlands and Luxembourg.<br \/>\nBelgium became one of the six founding members of the\u00a0European Coal and Steel Community\u00a0in 1951 and of the\u00a0European Atomic Energy Community\u00a0and\u00a0European Economic Community, established in 1957. The latter has now become the European Union, for which Belgium hosts major administrations and institutions, including the\u00a0European Commission, the\u00a0Council of the European Union, and the extraordinary and committee sessions of the\u00a0European Parliament.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GEOGRAPHY<\/strong><br \/>\nBelgium shares borders with\u00a0France\u00a0(620\u00a0km),\u00a0Germany\u00a0(167\u00a0km),\u00a0Luxembourg\u00a0(148\u00a0km), and the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Netherlands\">Netherlands<\/a>\u00a0(450\u00a0km). Its total surface, including water area, is 30,528 square kilometers from which land area alone 30,278\u00a0km2.\u00a0It lies between latitudes 49\u00b030 and 51\u00b030 N, and longitudes 2\u00b033 and 6\u00b024 E.<br \/>\nBelgium has three main geographical regions; the coastal plain in the northwest and the central plateau both belong to the Anglo-Belgian Basin, and the\u00a0Ardennes\u00a0uplands in the southeast to the\u00a0Hercynian orogenic belt. The\u00a0Paris Basin\u00a0reaches a small fourth area at Belgium&#8217;s southernmost tip,\u00a0Belgian Lorraine.<br \/>\nThe coastal plain consists mainly of sand dunes and\u00a0polders. Further inland lies a smooth, slowly rising landscape irrigated by numerous waterways, with fertile valleys and the northeastern sandy plain of the\u00a0Campine\u00a0(Kempen). The thickly forested hills and plateaux of the Ardennes are more rugged and rocky with caves and small\u00a0gorges. Extending westward into France, this area is eastwardly connected to the\u00a0Eifel\u00a0in Germany by the\u00a0High Fens plateau, on which the\u00a0Signal de Botrange\u00a0forms the country&#8217;s highest point at 694 meters (2,277\u00a0ft).<br \/>\nThe climate\u00a0is\u00a0maritime temperate\u00a0with significant precipitation in all seasons (K\u00f6ppen climate classification:\u00a0Cfb), like most of northwest Europe.D\u00a0The average temperature is lowest in January at 3\u00a0\u00b0C (37.4\u00a0\u00b0F) and highest in July at 18\u00a0\u00b0C (64.4\u00a0\u00b0F). The average precipitation per month varies between 54 millimeters (2.1\u00a0in) for February and April, to 78\u00a0mm (3.1\u00a0in) for July. Averages for the years 2000 to 2006 show daily temperature minimums of 7\u00a0\u00b0C (44.6\u00a0\u00b0F) and maximums of 14\u00a0\u00b0C (57.2\u00a0\u00b0F) and monthly rainfall of 74\u00a0mm (2.9\u00a0in); these are about 1\u00a0\u00b0C and nearly 10 millimeters above last century&#8217;s normal values, respectively.<br \/>\nPhytogeographically, Belgium is shared between the Atlantic European and Central European provinces of the\u00a0Circumboreal Region\u00a0within the\u00a0Boreal Kingdom.\u00a0According to the\u00a0World Wide Fund for Nature, the territory of Belgium belongs to the\u00a0ecoregion\u00a0of Atlantic mixed forests.\u00a0Because of its high population density, industrialization and its location in the center of Western Europe, Belgium still faces some\u00a0environmental problems. However, due to consistent efforts by the various levels of government in Belgium, the state of the environment in Belgium is gradually improving. This led to Belgium being ranked as\u00a0one of the top 10 countries\u00a0(9 out of 132) in terms of environmental protection trends, and to Belgium being ranked in 2012 as the 24th country out of 132 for environmental protection. Belgium moreover has one of Europe&#8217;s highest waste recycling rates. In particular, the Flemish region of Belgium has the highest waste diversion rate in Europe. Almost 75 percent of the residential waste produced there is reused, recycled, or composted.<br \/>\nThe territory of Belgium is divided into three regions, two of which, the\u00a0Flemish Region and\u00a0Walloon Region, are in turn subdivided into\u00a0provinces; the third Region, the\u00a0Brussels Capital Region, is neither a province nor a part of a province.<\/p>\n<p><strong>POLITICS<br \/>\n<\/strong>Belgium is a\u00a0constitutional,\u00a0popular monarchy\u00a0and a\u00a0federal\u00a0parliamentary democracy. The\u00a0bicameral federal parliament\u00a0is composed of a\u00a0Senate\u00a0and a\u00a0Chamber of Representatives. The former is made up of 50 senators appointed by the parliaments of the\u00a0communities and regions\u00a0and 10\u00a0co-opted senators. Prior to 2014, most of the Senate&#8217;s members were directly elected. The\u00a0Chamber&#8217;s 150 representatives are elected under a\u00a0proportional voting\u00a0system from 11\u00a0electoral districts. Belgium has\u00a0compulsory voting\u00a0and thus maintains one of the highest rates of\u00a0voter turnout\u00a0in the world.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0King\u00a0(currently\u00a0Philippe) is the\u00a0head of state, though with limited\u00a0prerogatives. He appoints ministers, including a Prime Minister, that has the confidence of the\u00a0Chamber of Representatives\u00a0to form the\u00a0federal government. The Council of Ministers is composed of no more than fifteen members. With the possible exception of the Prime Minister, the Council of Ministers is composed of an equal number of Dutch-speaking members and French-speaking members.\u00a0The judicial system is based on\u00a0civil law\u00a0and originates from the\u00a0Napoleonic code. The\u00a0Court of Cassation\u00a0is the court of last resort, with the\u00a0Court of Appeal\u00a0one level below.<br \/>\n<strong>Political culture. <\/strong>Belgium&#8217;s political institutions are complex;\u00a0most political power is organized around the need to represent the main cultural communities.\u00a0Since about 1970, the significant national\u00a0Belgian political parties\u00a0have split into distinct components that mainly represent the political and linguistic interests of these communities.\u00a0The major parties in each community, though close to the political center, belong to three main groups:\u00a0Christian Democrats,\u00a0Liberals, and\u00a0Social Democrats.\u00a0Further notable parties came into being well after the middle of the last century, mainly around\u00a0linguistic, nationalist, or environmental themes and recently smaller ones of some specific liberal nature.<br \/>\nA string of Christian Democrat coalition governments from 1958\u00a0was broken in 1999\u00a0after the first\u00a0dioxin crisis, a major\u00a0food contamination\u00a0scandal.\u00a0A &#8220;rainbow coalition&#8221; emerged from six parties: the Flemish and the French-speaking Liberals, Social Democrats, and Greens.\u00a0Later, a &#8220;purple coalition&#8221; of Liberals and Social Democrats formed after the Greens lost most of their seats in the\u00a02003 election.<br \/>\nThe government led by Prime Minister\u00a0Guy Verhofstadt\u00a0from 1999 to 2007 achieved a balanced budget, some\u00a0tax reforms, a labor-market reform, scheduled\u00a0nuclear phase-out, and instigated legislation allowing more stringent\u00a0war crime\u00a0and more lenient\u00a0soft drug usage\u00a0prosecution. Restrictions on withholding\u00a0euthanasia\u00a0were reduced and\u00a0same-sex marriage was legalized. The government promoted active diplomacy in Africa\u00a0and\u00a0opposed the invasion of Iraq.\u00a0It is the only country that does not have age restrictions on euthanasia.<br \/>\nVerhofstadt&#8217;s coalition fared badly in the\u00a0June 2007 elections. For more than a year, the country experienced a\u00a0political crisis.\u00a0This crisis was such that many observers speculated on a possible\u00a0partition of Belgium. From\u00a021 December\u00a02007 until\u00a020 March\u00a02008 the temporary\u00a0Verhofstadt\u00a0III Government\u00a0was in office. This coalition of the\u00a0Flemish\u00a0and\u00a0Francophone Christian Democrats, the\u00a0Flemish\u00a0and\u00a0Francophone Liberals\u00a0together with the\u00a0Francophone Social Democrats was an interim government until\u00a020 March\u00a02008.<br \/>\nOn that day a\u00a0new government, led by Flemish Christian Democrat\u00a0Yves Leterme, the actual winner of the federal elections of\u00a0June 2007, was sworn in by the king. On\u00a015 July\u00a02008 Leterme announced the resignation of the cabinet to the king, as no progress in\u00a0constitutional reforms\u00a0had been made.\u00a0In December 2008 he once more offered his resignation to the king after a\u00a0crisis\u00a0surrounding the sale of\u00a0Fortis\u00a0to\u00a0BNP Paribas.\u00a0At this juncture, his resignation was accepted and\u00a0Christian Democratic and Flemish\u00a0Herman Van Rompuy\u00a0were sworn in as Prime Minister on\u00a030 December\u00a02008.<br \/>\nAfter Herman Van Rompuy was designated the first permanent\u00a0President of the European Council\u00a0on\u00a019 November\u00a02009, he offered the resignation of his government to King Albert\u00a0II on\u00a025 November\u00a02009. A few hours later, the\u00a0new government\u00a0under Prime Minister\u00a0Yves Leterme\u00a0was sworn in. On\u00a022 April 2010, Leterme again offered the resignation of his cabinet to the king\u00a0after one of the coalition partners, the\u00a0OpenVLD, withdrew from the government, and on\u00a026 April\u00a02010 King Albert officially accepted the resignation.<br \/>\nThe Parliamentary elections in Belgium on\u00a013 June\u00a02010 saw the Flemish nationalist\u00a0N-VA\u00a0become the largest party in Flanders, and the Socialist Party PS the largest party in Wallonia.\u00a0Until December 2011, Belgium was governed by Leterme&#8217;s\u00a0caretaker government\u00a0awaiting the end of the deadlocked negotiations for the formation of a new government. By 30 March 2011, this set a new world record for the elapsed time without an official government, previously held by war-torn\u00a0Iraq.\u00a0Finally, in December 2011 the\u00a0Di Rupo Government\u00a0led by Walloon socialist Prime Minister\u00a0Elio Di Rupo\u00a0was sworn in.<br \/>\nThe\u00a02014 federal election\u00a0(coinciding with the\u00a0regional elections) resulted in a further electoral gain for the Flemish nationalist N-VA, although the incumbent coalition (composed of Flemish and French-speaking Social Democrats, Liberals, and Christian Democrats) maintains a solid majority in Parliament and in all electoral constituencies. On 22 July 2014, King Philippe nominated\u00a0Charles Michel\u00a0(MR) and\u00a0Kris Peeters\u00a0(CD&amp;V) to\u00a0lead the formation of a new federal cabinet\u00a0composed of the Flemish parties N-VA, CD&amp;V, Open Vld, and the French-speaking MR, which resulted in the\u00a0Michel Government. It is the first time N-VA is part of the federal cabinet, while the French-speaking side is represented only by the MR, which achieved a minority of the public votes in Wallonia.<\/p>\n<p><strong>REGIONS<\/strong><br \/>\nFlemish Region\u00a0\/ Dutch language area. Brussels-Capital Region \/ bilingual area<br \/>\nWalloon Region\u00a0\/ French and German language areas<br \/>\nFollowing a usage that can be traced back to the Burgundian and Habsburg courts,\u00a0in the 19th century it was necessary to speak French to belong to the governing upper class, and those who could only speak Dutch were effectively second-class citizens. Late that century, and continuing into the 20th century,\u00a0Flemish movements evolved to counter this situation.<br \/>\nWhile the people in Southern Belgium spoke French or dialects of French, and\u00a0most Brusselers adopted French\u00a0as their first language, the Flemings refused to do so and succeeded progressively in making Dutch an equal language in the education system.<br \/>\nFollowing World War\u00a0II, Belgian politics became increasingly dominated by the autonomy of its two main linguistic communities.\u00a0Intercommunal tensions rose and the constitution was amended to minimize the potential for conflict.<br \/>\nBased on the four language areas defined in 1962\u201363 (the Dutch, bilingual, French, and German language areas), consecutive\u00a0revisions\u00a0of\u00a0the country&#8217;s constitution\u00a0in 1970, 1980, 1988, and 1993 established a unique form of a federal state with segregated political power into three-level.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0constitutional language areas\u00a0determine the official languages in their municipalities, as well as the geographical limits of the empowered institutions for specific matters.\u00a0Although this would allow for seven parliaments and governments, when the Communities and Regions were created in 1980, Flemish politicians decided to merge both. Thus the Flemings just have one single institutional body of parliament and the government is empowered for all except federal and specific municipal matters.<br \/>\nThe overlapping boundaries of the Regions and Communities have created two notable peculiarities: the territory of the Brussels-Capital Region (which came into existence nearly a decade after the other regions) is included in both the Flemish and French Communities, and the territory of the German-speaking Community lies wholly within the Walloon Region. Conflicts about jurisdiction between the bodies are resolved by the\u00a0Constitutional Court of Belgium. The structure is intended as a compromise to allow different cultures to live together peacefully.<br \/>\n<strong>Locus of policy jurisdiction.\u00a0<\/strong>The Federal State&#8217;s authority includes justice, defense, federal police, social security, nuclear energy, monetary policy and public debt, and other aspects of public finances. State-owned companies include the\u00a0Belgian Post Group\u00a0and\u00a0Belgian Railways. The Federal Government is responsible for the obligations of Belgium and its federalized institutions towards the European Union and NATO. It controls substantial parts of public health, home affairs, and foreign affairs.\u00a0The budget\u2014without the debt\u2014controlled by the federal government amounts to about 50% of the national fiscal income. The federal government employs around 12% of the civil servants.<br \/>\nCommunities exercise their authority only within linguistically determined geographical boundaries, originally oriented towards the individuals of a Community&#8217;s language: culture (including audiovisual media), education, and the use of the relevant language. Extensions to personal matters less directly connected with language comprise health policy (curative and preventive medicine) and assistance to individuals (protection of youth, social welfare, aid to families,\u00a0immigrant\u00a0assistance services, and so on.).<br \/>\nRegions have authority in fields that can be broadly associated with their territory. These include economy, employment, agriculture, water policy, housing, public works, energy, transport, the environment, town and country planning, nature conservation, credit, and foreign trade. They supervise the provinces, municipalities, and intercommunal utility companies.<br \/>\nIn several fields, the different levels each have their own say on specifics. With education, for instance, the autonomy of the Communities neither includes decisions about the compulsory aspect nor allows for setting minimum requirements for awarding qualifications, which remain federal matters. Each level of government can be involved in scientific research and international relations associated with its powers. The treaty-making power of the Regions&#8217; and Communities&#8217; Governments is the broadest of all the Federating units of all the Federations all over the world.<br \/>\n<strong>Foreign relations. <\/strong>Because of its location at the crossroads of\u00a0Western Europe, Belgium has historically been the route of invading armies from its larger neighbors. With virtually defenseless borders, Belgium has traditionally sought to avoid domination by the more powerful nations that surround it through a policy of mediation. The Belgians have been strong advocates of\u00a0European integration. Both the\u00a0European Union\u00a0and\u00a0NATO\u00a0are headquartered in Belgium.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MILITARY<br \/>\n<\/strong>The Belgian Armed Forces have about 47,000 active troops. In 2010, Belgium&#8217;s defense budget totaled \u20ac3.95\u00a0billion (representing 1.12% of its GDP). They are organized into one unified structure consisting of four main components: Army, Air Force, Navy, and Medical.<br \/>\nThe effects of the\u00a0Second World War\u00a0made\u00a0collective security\u00a0a priority for\u00a0Belgian foreign policy. In March 1948 Belgium signed the\u00a0Treaty of Brussels and then joined\u00a0NATO\u00a0in 1948.\u00a0The Belgians, along with the Luxembourg government, sent a detachment of battalion strength to fight in Korea. This mission was the first in a long line of UN missions that the Belgians supported.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ECONOMY<br \/>\n<\/strong>Belgium&#8217;s strongly globalized economy\u00a0and its\u00a0transport infrastructure\u00a0are integrated with the rest of Europe. Its location at the heart of a highly industrialized region helped make it the world&#8217;s 15th largest trading nation in 2007.\u00a0The economy is characterized by a highly productive workforce, high\u00a0GNP, and high exports per capita.\u00a0Belgium&#8217;s main imports are raw materials, machinery and equipment, chemicals, raw diamonds, pharmaceuticals, foodstuffs, transportation equipment, and oil products. Its main exports are machinery and equipment, chemicals, finished diamonds, metals and metal products, and foodstuffs.<br \/>\nThe Belgian economy is heavily service-oriented and shows a dual nature: a dynamic Flemish economy and a Walloon economy that lags behind.\u00a0One of the founding members of the European Union, Belgium strongly supports an\u00a0open economy\u00a0and the extension of the powers of EU institutions to integrate member economies. Since 1922, through the\u00a0Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union, Belgium and Luxembourg have been a single trade market with customs and currency unions.<br \/>\nBelgium was the first continental European country to undergo the\u00a0Industrial Revolution, in the early 19th century.\u00a0Li\u00e8ge\u00a0and\u00a0Charleroi rapidly developed mining and steelmaking, which flourished until the mid-20th century in the\u00a0Sambre and Meuse valley\u00a0and made Belgium among one of the three most industrialized nations in the world from 1830 to 1910.\u00a0However, by the 1840s the textile industry of Flanders was in severe crisis, and the region experienced\u00a0famine\u00a0from 1846 to 1850.<br \/>\nAfter\u00a0World War II,\u00a0Ghent\u00a0and\u00a0Antwerp\u00a0experienced a rapid expansion of the chemical and petroleum industries. The\u00a01973\u00a0and\u00a01979 oil crises\u00a0sent the economy into a recession; it was particularly prolonged in Wallonia, where the steel industry had become less competitive and experienced serious decline.\u00a0In the 1980s and 1990s, the economic center of the country continued to shift northwards and is now concentrated in the populous\u00a0Flemish Diamond\u00a0area.<br \/>\nBy the end of the 1980s, Belgian\u00a0macroeconomic policies\u00a0had resulted in cumulative government debt of about 120% of GDP. As of 2006, the budget was balanced and public debt was equal to 90.30% of GDP.\u00a0From 1832 until 2002, Belgium&#8217;s currency was the\u00a0Belgian franc. Belgium switched to the euro in 2002, with the first sets of euro coins being minted in 1999. The standard\u00a0Belgian euro coins\u00a0designated for circulation show the portrait of the monarch (first King Albert\u00a0II, since 2013 King Philippe).<br \/>\nDespite an 18% decrease observed from 1970 to 1999, Belgium still had in 1999 the highest\u00a0rail network\u00a0density within the European Union with 113.8\u00a0km\/1 000\u00a0km2. On the other hand, the same period of time, 1970\u20131999, has seen a huge growth (+56%) of the\u00a0motorway network. In 1999, the density of km motorways per 1000\u00a0km2\u00a0and 1000 inhabitants amounted to 55.1 and 16.5 respectively and were significantly superior to the EU&#8217;s means of 13.7 and 15.9.<br \/>\nBelgium experiences some of the most congested traffic in Europe. In 2010, commuters to the cities of Brussels and Antwerp spent respectively 65 and 64 hours a year in traffic jams.<br \/>\nLike in most small European countries, more than 80% of the airways traffic is handled by a single airport, the\u00a0Brussels Airport.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0ports of Antwerp\u00a0and\u00a0Zeebrugge (Bruges)\u00a0share more than 80% of Belgian maritime traffic, Antwerp being the second European harbor with a gross weight of goods handled of 115 988 000 t in 2000 after a growth of 10.9% over the preceding five years.\u00a0In 2016, the port of Antwerp handled 214 million tons after a year-on-year growth of 2.7%.<br \/>\nThere is a large economic gap between\u00a0Flanders\u00a0and\u00a0Wallonia. Wallonia was historically wealthy compared to Flanders, mostly due to its\u00a0heavy industries, but the decline of the steel industry post-World War II led to the region&#8217;s rapid decline, whereas Flanders rose swiftly. Since then, Flanders has been prosperous, among the wealthiest regions in Europe, whereas Wallonia has been languishing. As of 2007, the unemployment rate of Wallonia is over double that of Flanders. The divide has played a key part in the tensions between the Flemish and Walloons in addition to the already-existing language divide.\u00a0Pro-independence movements\u00a0have gained high popularity in Flanders as a consequence. The separatist\u00a0New Flemish Alliance(N-VA) party for instance is the largest party in Belgium.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY<br \/>\n<\/strong>Contributions to the development of science and technology have appeared throughout the country&#8217;s history. The 16th-century\u00a0Early Modern\u00a0flourishing of Western Europe included\u00a0cartographer\u00a0Gerardus Mercator,\u00a0anatomist\u00a0Andreas Vesalius,\u00a0herbalist\u00a0Rembert Dodoens\u00a0and\u00a0mathematician\u00a0Simon Stevin\u00a0among the most influential scientists.<br \/>\nChemist\u00a0Ernest Solvay\u00a0and engineer\u00a0Zenobe Gramme\u00a0(\u00c9cole Industrielle de Li\u00e8ge)\u00a0gave their names to the\u00a0Solvay process\u00a0and the\u00a0Gramme dynamo, respectively, in the 1860s.\u00a0Bakelite\u00a0was developed in 1907\u20131909 by\u00a0Leo Baekeland. Ernest Solvay also acted as a major philanthropist and gave its name to the\u00a0Solvay Institute of Sociology, the\u00a0Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management, and the International Solvay Institutes for Physics and Chemistry which are now part of the\u00a0Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles. In 1911, he started a series of conferences, the\u00a0Solvay Conferences\u00a0on Physics and Chemistry, which have had a deep impact on the evolution of quantum physics and chemistry.\u00a0A major contribution to fundamental science was also due to a Belgian,\u00a0Monsignor\u00a0Georges Lema\u00eetre\u00a0(Catholic University of Leuven), who is credited with proposing the\u00a0Big Bang\u00a0theory of the origin of the universe in 1927.<br \/>\nThree\u00a0Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine\u00a0were awarded to Belgians:\u00a0Jules Bordet\u00a0(Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles) in 1919,\u00a0Corneille Heymans\u00a0(University of Ghent) in 1938 and\u00a0Albert Claude\u00a0(Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles) together with\u00a0Christian de Duve\u00a0(Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain) in 1974.\u00a0Fran\u00e7ois Englert\u00a0(Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles) was awarded the\u00a0Nobel Prize in Physics\u00a0in 2013.\u00a0Ilya Prigogine(Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles) was awarded the\u00a0Nobel Prize in Chemistry\u00a0in 1977.\u00a0Two Belgian mathematicians have been awarded the\u00a0Fields Medal:\u00a0Pierre Deligne\u00a0in 1978 and\u00a0Jean Bourgain\u00a0in 1994.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DEMOGRAPHICS<br \/>\n<\/strong>As of 1\u00a0January\u00a02015, the total population of Belgium according to its population register was 11,190,845.\u00a0Almost all of the population is urban, at 97% in 2004.\u00a0The population density of Belgium is 365 per square kilometer (952 per square mile) as of March 2013. The most densely inhabited area is Flanders.\u00a0The Ardennes have the lowest density. As of 1\u00a0January\u00a02015, the Flemish Region had a population of 6,437,680, its most populous cities being\u00a0Antwerp\u00a0(511,771), Ghent (252,274), and\u00a0Bruges\u00a0(117,787). Wallonia had 3,585,214 with\u00a0Charleroi (202,021),\u00a0Li\u00e8ge\u00a0(194,937) and\u00a0Namur\u00a0(110,447), its most populous cities.\u00a0Brussels\u00a0has 1,167,951 inhabitants in the Capital Region&#8217;s\u00a019 municipalities, three of which have over 100,000 residents.<br \/>\n<strong>Migration.<\/strong> As of 2007, nearly 92% of the population had Belgian citizenship,\u00a0and other European Union member citizens account for around 6%. The prevalent foreign nationals were Italian (171,918), French (125,061), Dutch (116,970),\u00a0Moroccan\u00a0(80,579),\u00a0Portuguese\u00a0(43,509), Spanish (42,765),\u00a0Turkish\u00a0(39,419) and German (37,621).\u00a0In 2007, there were 1.38\u00a0million foreign-born residents in Belgium, corresponding to 12.9% of the total population. Of these, 685,000 (6.4%) were born outside the EU and 695,000 (6.5%) were born in another EU Member State.<br \/>\nAt the beginning of 2012, people of foreign background and their descendants were estimated to have formed around 25% of the total population i.e. 2.8\u00a0million\u00a0new Belgians.\u00a0Of these new Belgians, 1,200,000 are of European ancestry and 1,350,000 are from non-Western countries (most of them from\u00a0Morocco,\u00a0Turkey, and DR Congo). Since the modification of the\u00a0Belgian nationality law\u00a0in 1984 more than\u00a01.3\u00a0million migrants have acquired Belgian citizenship. The largest group of immigrants and their descendants in Belgium are\u00a0Moroccans.\u00a089.2% of inhabitants of\u00a0Turkish\u00a0origin have been naturalized, as have 88.4% of people of Moroccan background, 75.4% of Italians, 56.2% of the French, and 47.8% of Dutch people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>LANGUAGES<\/strong><br \/>\nBelgium has three official languages: Dutch 59%, French 40%, and German 1%. A number of non-official minority languages are spoken as well.\u00a0As no census exists, there are no official statistical data regarding the distribution or usage of Belgium&#8217;s three official languages or their\u00a0dialects.\u00a0However, various criteria, including the language(s) of parents, of education, or the second-language status of foreign-born, may provide suggested figures. An estimated 60% of the Belgian population speaks Dutch (often referred to as Flemish), and 40% of the population speaks French. French-speaking Belgians are often referred to as Walloons, although the French speakers in Brussels are not Walloons.<br \/>\nTotal Dutch speakers are 6.23\u00a0million, concentrated in the northern Flanders region, while French speakers number 3.32\u00a0million in Wallonia and an estimated 870,000 (or 85%) in the officially bilingual Brussels-Capital Region. The\u00a0German-speaking Community\u00a0is made up of 73,000 people in the east of the\u00a0Walloon Region; around 10,000 German and 60,000 Belgian nationals are speakers of German. Roughly 23,000 more German speakers live in municipalities near the official Community.<br \/>\nBoth\u00a0Belgian Dutch\u00a0and\u00a0Belgian French\u00a0have\u00a0minor differences\u00a0in vocabulary and semantic nuances from the varieties spoken respectively in the Netherlands and France. Many Flemish people still speak\u00a0dialects of Dutch\u00a0in their local environment.\u00a0Walloon, considered either as a dialect of French or a distinct\u00a0Romance language,\u00a0is now only understood and spoken occasionally, mostly by elderly people. Walloon is divided into four dialects, which along with those of\u00a0Picard,\u00a0are rarely used in public life and have largely been replaced by French.<\/p>\n<p><strong>RELIGION<br \/>\n<\/strong>Since the country&#8217;s independence,\u00a0Roman Catholicism, counterbalanced by strong\u00a0free thought\u00a0movements, has had an important role in Belgium&#8217;s politics.\u00a0However Belgium is largely a secular country as the\u00a0laicist constitution\u00a0provides for freedom of religion, and the government generally respects this right in practice. During the reigns of\u00a0Albert\u00a0I\u00a0and\u00a0Baudouin, the monarchy had a reputation of deeply rooted Catholicism.<br \/>\nRoman Catholicism has traditionally been Belgium&#8217;s majority religion; being especially strong in Flanders. However, by 2009 Sunday\u00a0church attendance\u00a0was 5% for Belgium in total; 3% in Brussels, and 5.4% in Flanders. Church attendance in 2009 in Belgium was roughly half of the Sunday church attendance in 1998 (11% for the total of Belgium in 1998)\u00a0Despite the drop in church attendance, Catholic identity nevertheless remains an important part of Belgium&#8217;s culture.<br \/>\nAccording to the Eurobarometer 2010,\u00a037% of Belgian citizens responded that they believe there is a God. 31% answered that they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force. 27% answered that they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force. 5% did not respond. According to the Eurobarometer 2015, 60.7% of the total population of Belgium adhered to Christianity, with Roman Catholicism being the largest denomination with 52.9%. Protestants comprised 2.1% and Orthodox Christians were 1.6% of the total. Non-religious people comprised 32.0% of the population and were divided between atheists (14.9%) and agnostics (17.1%). A further 5.2% of the population was Muslim and 2.1% were believers in other religions.\u00a0The same survey held in 2012 found that Christianity was the largest religion in Belgium accounting for 65% of\u00a0Belgians.<br \/>\nSymbolically and materially, the Roman Catholic Church remains in a favorable position.\u00a0Belgium officially recognizes three religions: Christianity (Catholic, Protestantism, Orthodox churches, and Anglicanism), Islam, and Judaism.<br \/>\nIn the early 2000s, there were approximately 42,000 Jews in Belgium. The\u00a0Jewish Community of Antwerp\u00a0(numbering some 18,000) is one of the largest in Europe, and one of the last places in the world where\u00a0Yiddish\u00a0is the primary language of a large Jewish community (mirroring certain Orthodox and Hasidic communities in New York, New Jersey, and Israel). In addition, most Jewish children in Antwerp receive a Jewish education.\u00a0There are several Jewish newspapers and more than 45 active synagogues (30 of which are in Antwerp) in the country. A 2006 inquiry in Flanders, considered to be a more religious region than Wallonia, showed that 55% considered themselves religious and that 36% believed that God created the universe.\u00a0On the other hand, Wallonia has become one of Europe&#8217;s most secular\/least religious regions. Most of the French-speaking region&#8217;s population does not consider religion an important part of their lives, and as much as 45% of the population identifies as irreligious. This is particularly the case in eastern Wallonia and areas along the French border.<br \/>\nA 2008 estimate found that approximately 6% of the Belgian population (628,751 people) is\u00a0Muslim. Muslims constitute 23.6% of the population of\u00a0Brussels, 4.9% of\u00a0Wallonia, and 5.1% of\u00a0Flanders. The majority of Belgian Muslims live in major cities, such as\u00a0Antwerp, Brussels, and\u00a0Charleroi. The largest group of immigrants in Belgium are Moroccans, with 400,000 people. The Turks are the third-largest group, and the second-largest Muslim ethnic group, numbering 220,000.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HEALTH<br \/>\n<\/strong>The Belgians enjoy good health. According to 2012 estimates, the average life expectancy is 79.65 years.\u00a0Since 1960, life expectancy has, in line with the European average, grown by two months per year. Death in Belgium is mainly due to heart and vascular disorders,\u00a0neoplasms, disorders of the respiratory system, and unnatural causes of death (accidents, suicide). Non-natural causes of death and cancer are the most common causes of death for females up to age 24 and males up to age 44.<br \/>\nHealthcare in Belgium\u00a0is financed through both social security contributions and taxation. Health insurance is compulsory. Health care is delivered by a mixed public and private system of independent medical practitioners and public, university, and semi-private hospitals. Health care services are payable by the patient and reimbursed later by health insurance institutions, but for ineligible categories (of patients and services) so-called 3rd party payment systems exist.<br \/>\nFor the first time in Belgian history, the first child was euthanized following the 2 year mark of the removal of the euthanization age restrictions. The child had been euthanized due to an incurable disease that was inflicted upon the child. Although there may have been some support for euthanization there is a possibility of controversy due to the issue revolving around the subject of assisted suicide.<\/p>\n<p><strong>EDUCATION<br \/>\n<\/strong>Education is compulsory from 6 to 18 years of age for Belgians.\u00a0Among\u00a0OECD\u00a0countries in 2002, Belgium had the third-highest proportion of 18- to 21-year-olds enrolled in\u00a0postsecondary education, at 42%.\u00a0Though an estimated 99% of the adult population is literate, the concern is rising over\u00a0functional illiteracy.\u00a0The\u00a0Programme for International Student Assessment\u00a0(PISA), coordinated by the OECD, currently ranks Belgium&#8217;s education as the 19th best in the world, being significantly higher than the OECD average.\u00a0Education being organized separately by each, the Flemish Community scores noticeably above the French and German-speaking Communities.<br \/>\nMirroring the dual structure of the 19th-century Belgian political landscape, characterized by the\u00a0Liberal\u00a0and the\u00a0Catholic parties, the educational system is segregated within a secular and a religious segment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CULTURE<br \/>\n<\/strong>Despite its\u00a0political and linguistic divisions, the region corresponding to today&#8217;s Belgium has seen the flourishing of major artistic movements that have had a tremendous influence on European art and culture. Nowadays, to a certain extent, cultural life is concentrated within each language Community, and a variety of barriers have made a shared cultural sphere less pronounced.\u00a0Since the 1970s, there are no bilingual universities or colleges in the country except the\u00a0Royal Military Academy\u00a0and the\u00a0Antwerp Maritime Academy, no common media\u00a0and no single large cultural or scientific organization in which both main communities are represented.<br \/>\n<strong>Fine arts.<\/strong> Contributions to painting and architecture have been especially rich. The\u00a0Mosan art, the\u00a0Early Netherlandish, the\u00a0Flemish Renaissance\u00a0and\u00a0Baroque painting\u00a0and major examples of\u00a0Romanesque,\u00a0Gothic,\u00a0Renaissance, and\u00a0Baroque architecture\u00a0are milestones in the history of art. While the 15th century&#8217;s art in the Low Countries is dominated by the religious paintings of\u00a0Jan van Eyck\u00a0and\u00a0Rogier van der Weyden, the 16th century is characterized by a broader panel of styles such as\u00a0Peter Breughel&#8217;s landscape paintings and\u00a0Lambert Lombard&#8217;s representation of the antique.\u00a0Though the Baroque style of\u00a0Peter Paul Rubens\u00a0and\u00a0Anthony van Dyck flourished in the early 17th century in the Southern Netherlands,\u00a0it gradually declined thereafter.<br \/>\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries many original\u00a0romantic,\u00a0expressionist\u00a0and\u00a0surrealist\u00a0Belgian painters emerged, including\u00a0James Ensor\u00a0and other artists belonging to the\u00a0Les XX\u00a0group,\u00a0Constant Permeke,\u00a0Paul Delvaux\u00a0and\u00a0Ren\u00e9 Magritte. The avant-garde\u00a0CoBrA movement\u00a0appeared in the 1950s, while the sculptor\u00a0Panamarenko remains a remarkable figure in contemporary art.\u00a0Multidisciplinary artists\u00a0Jan Fabre,\u00a0Wim Delvoye, and the painter&#8217;s Guy Huygens and\u00a0Luc Tuymans\u00a0are other internationally renowned figures on the contemporary art scene.<br \/>\nBelgian contributions to architecture also continued into the 19th and 20th centuries, including the work of\u00a0Victor Horta\u00a0and\u00a0Henry van de Velde, who were major initiators of the\u00a0Art Nouveau\u00a0style.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0vocal music\u00a0of the\u00a0Franco-Flemish School\u00a0developed in the southern part of the Low Countries and was an important contribution to Renaissance culture.\u00a0In the 19th and 20th centuries, there was an emergence of major violinists, such as\u00a0Henri Vieuxtemps,\u00a0Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe, and\u00a0Arthur Grumiaux, while\u00a0Adolphe Sax\u00a0invented the saxophone in 1846. The composer\u00a0C\u00e9sar Franck\u00a0was born in Li\u00e8ge in 1822. Contemporary\u00a0popular music\u00a0in Belgium is also of repute. Jazz musician\u00a0Toots Thielemans\u00a0and singer\u00a0Jacques Brel\u00a0have achieved global fame. Nowadays, singer\u00a0Stromae\u00a0has been a musical revelation in Europe and beyond, having great success. In rock\/pop music,\u00a0Telex,\u00a0Front 242,\u00a0K&#8217;s Choice,\u00a0Hooverphonic,\u00a0Zap Mama,\u00a0Soulwax, and\u00a0dEUS\u00a0are well known. In the heavy metal scene, bands like\u00a0Machiavel,\u00a0Channel Zero, and\u00a0Enthroned\u00a0have a worldwide fan base.<br \/>\nBelgium has produced several well-known\u00a0authors, including the poets\u00a0Emile Verhaeren,\u00a0Robert Goffin, and novelists\u00a0Hendrik Conscience,\u00a0Georges Simenon,\u00a0Suzanne Lilar,\u00a0Hugo Claus, Joseph Weterings and\u00a0Am\u00e9lie Nothomb. The poet and playwright\u00a0Maurice Maeterlinck\u00a0won the\u00a0Nobel Prize in literature\u00a0in 1911.\u00a0The Adventures of Tintin\u00a0by\u00a0Herg\u00e9\u00a0is the best known of\u00a0Franco-Belgian comics, but many other major authors, including\u00a0Peyo\u00a0(The Smurfs),\u00a0Andr\u00e9 Franquin\u00a0(Gaston Lagaffe),\u00a0Dupa\u00a0(Cubitus),\u00a0Morris\u00a0(Lucky Luke),\u00a0Greg\u00a0(Achille Talon),\u00a0Lambil\u00a0(Les Tuniques Bleues),\u00a0Edgar P. Jacobs\u00a0and\u00a0Willy Vandersteen\u00a0brought the Belgian cartoon strip industry a worldwide fame.<br \/>\n<strong>Folklore.<\/strong> Folklore plays a major role in Belgium&#8217;s cultural life: the country has a comparatively high number of processions, cavalcades, parades, &#8216;ommegangs&#8217; and &#8216;ducasses&#8217;,\u00a0&#8216;kermesse&#8217; and other local festivals, nearly always with an originally religious or\u00a0mythological background. The\u00a0Carnival of Binche\u00a0with its famous\u00a0Gilles\u00a0and the &#8216;Processional Giants and Dragons&#8217; of\u00a0Ath, Brussels,\u00a0Dendermonde,\u00a0Mechelen, and\u00a0Mons\u00a0are recognized by\u00a0UNESCO\u00a0as\u00a0Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.<br \/>\nOther examples are the\u00a0Carnival of Aalst; the still very religious processions of\u00a0the Holy Blood\u00a0in\u00a0Bruges,\u00a0Virga Jesse Basilica\u00a0in\u00a0Hasselt, and\u00a0Basilica of Our Lady of Hanswijk\u00a0in Mechelen;\u00a015 August\u00a0festival in\u00a0Li\u00e8ge; and the Walloon festival in\u00a0Namur. Originated in 1832 and revived in the 1960s, the\u00a0Gentse Feesten\u00a0has become a modern tradition. A major non-official holiday is Saint Nicholas Day, a festivity for children and, in Li\u00e8ge, for students.<br \/>\n<strong>Cuisine.<\/strong> Many highly ranked Belgian restaurants can be found in the most influential restaurant guides, such as the\u00a0Michelin Guide.\u00a0Belgium is famous for\u00a0beer,\u00a0chocolate,\u00a0waffles, and\u00a0french fries\u00a0with\u00a0mayonnaise. Contrary to their name, french fries are claimed to have originated in Belgium, although their exact place of origin is uncertain. The national dishes are &#8220;steak and fries\u00a0with salad&#8221;, and &#8220;mussels with fries&#8221;.<br \/>\nBrands of Belgian chocolate and\u00a0pralines, like\u00a0C\u00f4te d&#8217;Or,\u00a0Neuhaus,\u00a0Leonidas, and\u00a0Godiva\u00a0are famous, as well as independent producers such as Burie and Del Rey in Antwerp and Mary&#8217;s in Brussels.<br \/>\nBelgium produces over\u00a01100 varieties of beer.\u00a0The\u00a0Trappist beer\u00a0of the\u00a0Abbey of Westvleteren\u00a0has repeatedly been rated the world&#8217;s best beer.\u00a0The biggest brewer in the world by volume is\u00a0Anheuser-Busch InBev, based in\u00a0Leuven.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SPORTS<br \/>\n<\/strong>Since the 1970s, sports clubs and federations are organized separately within each language community. Association football\u00a0is the most popular sport in both parts of Belgium; also very popular are cycling, tennis, swimming, judo, and basketball.<br \/>\nBelgians hold\u00a0the most Tour de France victories\u00a0of any country except France. They have also the most victories on the\u00a0UCI Road World Championships.\u00a0Philippe Gilbert\u00a0is the 2012 world champion. Another modern well-known Belgian cyclist is\u00a0Tom Boonen. With five victories in the\u00a0Tour de France\u00a0and numerous other cycling records, Belgian cyclist\u00a0Eddy Merckx is regarded as one of the greatest cyclists of all time.\u00a0Jean-Marie Pfaff, a former Belgian goalkeeper, is considered one of the greatest in the history of association football.<br \/>\nBelgium hosted the\u00a01972 European Football Championships and co-hosted the\u00a02000 European Championships\u00a0with the Netherlands. The\u00a0Belgium national football team\u00a0reached first place in the\u00a0FIFA World Rankings\u00a0for the first time in November 2015.<br \/>\nKim Clijsters\u00a0and\u00a0Justine Henin\u00a0both were\u00a0Player of the Year\u00a0in the\u00a0Women&#8217;s Tennis Association\u00a0as they were ranked the number one female tennis player.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Spa-Francorchamps\u00a0motor-racing circuit hosts the\u00a0Formula One World Championship\u00a0Belgian Grand Prix. The Belgian driver,\u00a0Jacky Ickx, won eight Grands Prix and six\u00a024 Hours of Le Mans\u00a0and finished twice as runner-up in the Formula One World Championship.<br \/>\nBelgium also has a strong reputation in,\u00a0motocross with the rider\u00a0Stefan Everts.<br \/>\nSporting events annually held in Belgium include the\u00a0Memorial Van Damme\u00a0athletics competition, the\u00a0Belgian Grand Prix Formula One, and a number of\u00a0classic cycle races\u00a0such as the\u00a0Tour of Flanders\u00a0and\u00a0Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge.
