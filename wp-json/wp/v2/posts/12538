These can be found opposite the first police checkpoint north of Dakhla, the going rate is 250-380 dirham (negotiable) the ride should be started rather early and takes most of the day and border crossing is closed overnight. Cars with experienced drivers can be organized from Hotel Sahara (the budget one). This costs around 250 dirham per person.<br \/>\nTo\u00a0<b>Morocco<\/b>: Cars with drivers can be arranged to cross the minefield from Mauritania to Western Sahara from Hotels in Nouadhibou.<br \/>\nFrom\u00a0<b>Senegal<\/b>: Bush taxis can be taken from Dakar (6,000\u00a0CFA francs) and St Louis (2,000 CFA francs) (amongst others) to Rosso, where a ferry makes the trip across the Senegal river, and further bush taxis can be taken to Nouakchott (about 200 ouguiya). Be careful of bush taxis offering deals that seem too good to be true. They may be illegal taxis and could prove to be a dangerous means of transport. There will most likely be a number of drivers waiting. Ask around and find out the going rate. Other crossing points from Senegal include the Diama dam just north of St Louis, public transport also operates on this route.<br \/>\nFrom\u00a0<b>Mali<\/b>: Pickup trucks leave Kayes for Selibaby daily. It is also possible to enter at Nema, and across the southern border at several points.<\/span><\/h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>GET AROUND<\/strong> <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Make sure to have plenty of passport copies for travelling between towns. It\u2019s not uncommon to give away up to 5-10 passport copies a day to police at checkpoints.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>By train.<\/strong> There is only one train line in\u00a0Mauritania, linking\u00a0Nouadhibou,\u00a0Choum\u00a0and\u00a0Zouerat, but it&#8217;s a tourist attraction itself. It&#8217;s used to carry iron ore from the Zouerat mine to\u00a0Nouadhibou\u00a0harbour.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The train departs daily from Nouadhibou at around 15:00 and arrives in Choum (for Atar) at around 02:00 the next morning. Check departure times on arrival.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In\u00a0Mauritania\u00a0there is only one passenger car, but travel in iron ore hopper is also possible (and advisable, as the passenger car is usually overcrowded and tickets are required). There is also first-class accommodation &#8211; first-class seats are limited, but they allow access to a smaller room with bunk beds. It does not necessarily ensure more comfort, though. Ticket price is 300 ouguiya (2018) for second class in the passenger car and travel in the hopper is free of charge. Remember to have a scarf to cover your face, as there is a lot of dust.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">From\u00a0Choum\u00a0it&#8217;s possible to get to Atar with a bush taxi. The journey could take up to eight hours if the vehicle has a breakdown.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Language.<\/strong> Arabic is the official language. Hassaniya Arabic is the language of the Moor majority, while other languages are spoken by black Africans in the south including Pulaar,\u00a0Wolof, and\u00a0Soninke\u00a0(especially in the Guidimakha region around Selibaby).\u00a0French\u00a0is still spoken by many. This is especially true near towns. In the countryside, individuals may often speak several languages but not French.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">It is considered polite to say\u00a0<i>Salaam aleikum<\/i>\u00a0when entering a taxi, office or when greeting someone. It is the first greeting for most of the dialects spoken in the region.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-h2section\">\n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div class=\"thumbinner\">\n<div class=\"thumbcaption\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>MONEY<\/strong><br \/>\nThe country&#8217;s currency is the\u00a0<b>Mauritanian ouguiya<\/b>, denoted by the symbol &#8220;<b>UM<\/b>&#8221; (<b>MRU<\/b>).<br \/>\nMauritania is poorly connected to the international banking system. Many ATMs in Nouakchott now accept international Visa cards, but otherwise, credit cards are accepted almost nowhere. It is easy to change euros, dollars and CFA francs in Nouakchott. There are few Mastercard and Visa card ATMs in Nouadhibou.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mw-h2section\">\n<div class=\"mw-h3section\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><span id=\"Shopping\" class=\"mw-headline\">Shopping.\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>Souvenirs can be bought at March\u00e9 Capital or March\u00e9 Sixi\u00e8me in Nouakchott, or at tourist shops in the Adrar. Fabric will be sold in boutiques all over the country, but Kaedi is famous for its tie-dying.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">When buying anything in Mauritania, be sure to\u00a0bargain. Sometimes the starting price will be three times the actual price. Stay friendly, but don&#8217;t worry about insulting anyone by asking for a lower price.<\/span><\/h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>CUISINE<\/strong> <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">There is a decent variety of restaurants in Nouakchott with dishes costing from UM100 to 250. Most restaurants in the capital offer much the same menu &#8211; simple pizzas, hamburgers, sandwiches and salads. There is a string of restaurants on the road from the Stade Olympique to the French Embassy. Good ones include Pizza Lina, Caf\u00e9 Liban and Le Petit Caf\u00e9. The Sahara Caf\u00e9, on the other side of the stadium, is also a good place for pizza, sandwiches or Lebanese dishes, and has some of the best reasonably-priced food in town. Near Marche Capitale, there is a street of sandwich shops that offer near-identical menus, the best of which is the Prince (which taxi drivers know by name).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Outside of Nouakchott, it is possible to find a hamburger in Atar. Otherwise, the choice is local dishes: fish and rice (chebujin) in the south and rice and meat or couscous in the north. Hole-in-the-wall restaurants can be found everywhere and serve meals from UM 20-50. Mechui, or grilled sheep, is also delicious if a little more expensive. Look for carcasses hanging by the side of the road. Some fruit can be found in most regional capitals. Note that most restaurants outside of Nouakchott do not have very high standards of cleanliness. Since most small restaurants go under within a few years of opening, your best bet in trying to find one in a regional capital is to just ask locals for directions to whatever is nearby. Another alternative, in the absence of a restaurant, is paying a family to prepare food for you, which should be relatively inexpensive (no more than UM 150), even if it takes a while (up to a couple hours to buy the food and prepare it).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Bottled water can be bought for UM 20 and is a good idea for anyone not accustomed to Africa.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">If none of this sounds good, keep in mind that boutiques everywhere sell bread, cakes, biscuits and drinks if nothing else.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Tea is usually served after a meal, but it is not included with the meal at restaurants. If you are offered tea in someone&#8217;s home, it is impolite to leave until at least the second (of three) glasses. The whole process takes about an hour.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Drink.<\/strong> Despite being an Islamic country there are a few fun bars in the capital. Drinking can be expensive, with a beer costing up to US$6. There is a nightclub inside the French Embassy compound. For the non-French, try the Salamander or the trashy (but open late) Club VIP. Next door to VIP is the Casablanca, a more low-key bar with live music on the weekends.\u00a0It is illegal to import alcohol\u00a0beyond 0.5 litres, which must be declared.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>ACCOMMODATION<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">All ranges of accommodation are available, with the highest class hotels available only in Nouakchott and Atar. &#8220;Auberges&#8221; and Campsites can rent beds\/mattresses for as little as UM 150 in the Adrar and Nouadhibou.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">There is usually at least one hotel in the regional capitals in the rest of the country, although they can be expensive for what you are getting. If possible, make friends with a local and try to get invited to stay with their family. As long as you don&#8217;t mind sleeping on the ground on a foam mat, sleeping\/eating near animals or using a latrine, you will probably end up having a pleasant and memorable stay.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>STAY SAFE<\/strong> <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The area near the Western Sahara is heavily mined and travel through this area is highly inadvisable. Border areas lining Algeria and Mali are notorious for banditry. The single paved road coming from Morocco is especially dangerous, having been the site of Al Qaida kidnappings. If you must travel on this path, it is best to do so in a tight caravan. In other areas, one should avoid flaunting wealth or expensive wares. Daunting though it may seem, a bit of research and common sense will ensure a pleasant trip in Mauritania.<br \/>\nCheck your embassy or consulate travel advisories carefully. Due to increasing numbers of attacks on Westerners in the past several years, most Western nations advise great caution. Resident expatriates travel between cities by day, in groups and on major routes.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Health.<\/strong> For the majority of Westerners, the local\u00a0<b>water<\/b>\u00a0in any part of the country (including Nouakchott) is not safe to drink. Visitors should drink only bottled water if they don&#8217;t have access to some type of water purifying or filtration system. The Sahara is a very dry climate. You may become dehydrated quite easily, and not be aware of it. The best rule of thumb is to be sure that you have urinated three times each day, at reasonable intervals. In the hottest part of the year, this might mean drinking several litres of water each day.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Malaria<\/b>\u00a0is endemic in the southern part of the country, and visitors should always use a mosquito net there. Mosquitoes are less common in the dry desert in the north of the country, but exist year-round in the south, if a bit less prevalent during the dry season (December-May).<\/span><\/h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>RESPECT<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Learn\u00a0<i>Salaam alaykum<\/i>\u00a0and use it when greeting people. If you are a man, don&#8217;t try to shake hands with a woman, and vice versa (note that some African women will not have a problem with shaking a man&#8217;s hand, but it is best to not try to initiate contact, just follow their lead). You can, however, say hello and touch your hand over your heart.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Be careful to eat with your right hand, especially outside of Nouakchott where you may not be offered silverware. Like other places in the Arab world, the left hand is reserved for the bathroom. If you&#8217;re left-handed&#8230; try hard.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Covering your head isn&#8217;t required, but it is polite. It may cut down on the\u00a0<i>Madame, ou bien Mademoiselle?<\/i>\u00a0(Mrs. or Miss?) question, but Westerners, especially women, will be the target of unwanted attention and minor harassment everywhere in the country. Be aware though, that many Mauritanians, both male and female, think that a direct gaze is a sexual invitation. There is even a phrase in Hassiniya,\u00a0<i>ayna m&#8217;tina<\/i>, meaning\u00a0<i>strong eyes<\/i>, to describe what many people feel is an aggressive act. This doesn&#8217;t mean however, that the men have carte blanche to be jerks, though. Calling them on their bad behaviour, or pointing it out to the ever present bystanders, can often work. If you give respect, you can demand it also. The Moors respect women who stand up for themselves, even while they push you to see how far they can get.<br \/>\nIf you are travelling with someone of the opposite sex, avoid touching in public. It&#8217;s actually much more common to see two men holding hands than a woman and a man. As far as dress, the more skin you show, the more negative attention you will receive. In Nouakchott, women can wear trousers, but avoid tank tops and to-the-knee skirts. Long skirts are the best choice for women. It is a good idea to cover your arms also. Trousers display the crotch area and thus are also disturbing, especially to people in the countryside who aren&#8217;t as used to seeing this as the city folk. Most people will be very polite, and you will not know what they are thinking.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">If you are a female, there is no non-sexual reason,\u00a0<b>ever<\/b>, to go off in private with a man. If they ask you to step into an office, or back of a shop or anywhere; don&#8217;t. The men are aware that that is an unreasonable request, and no one would ask you for a private chat if they meant well. If you allow yourself to be alone with a man, for however brief a time, everyone will assume you had sex, and will judge you accordingly. As a weakling, not as dissolute.<br \/>\nIf you are a LGBT visitor,\u00a0do not\u00a0try to be open about your sexuality to any Mauritanian. They will act very harshly to this. Also do not make any acts in public that would imply the fact that you are LGBT:\u00a0Mauritania imposes the death sentence for homosexuality.<br \/>\nIf you are white,\u00a0<i>Nasrani<\/i>,\u00a0<i>Toubac<\/i>\u00a0and\u00a0<i>Toubab<\/i>\u00a0refers to you. Little kids, and sometimes rude adults, will refer to you by this name.\u00a0<i>Nasrani<\/i>\u00a0actually means a person from Nazareth. Since Christians follow Christ&#8217;s teachings, and Christ is from Nazareth, then Christians are all honorary Nazarenes.<br \/>\nBeware of people who may try to take advantage of your politeness in order to try to make a sale. Be aware that in market areas, almost everyone who tries to befriend you is trying to sell you something at an inflated price. They will try many tricks to get you to buy items from them (including &#8220;giving them to you as a gift&#8221;), and a few might even accuse you of not liking Africans if you decline to look at their souvenir shop. If someone is going beyond the normal limits to bother you, it is not impolite to tell them, without question, that you are not interested. If they ask for something that you own, just say that you need it now, and can give it to them in a month or so.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>CONNECT<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">There are three operators of GSM networks:\u00a0Mattel\u00a0(excellent English website),\u00a0Mauritel Mobiles\u00a0and\u00a0Chinguitel. Prepaid plans are available for three of them. Further Information regarding Coverage and Roaming are available from\u00a0GSM-World.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">For tours into the desert where no GSM-Network is available satellite phones are a good solution. Service providers include Thuraya, Iridium and Inmarsat. Thuraya tends to be the cheapest and the easiest to use. The equipment is also available for rent.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Internet caf\u00e9s with DSL internet can be found in Nouakchott and\u00a0Nouadhibou\u00a0for MRO200-300\/h. Slower connections plague &#8220;cybercaf\u00e9s&#8221; elsewhere in the country, but it&#8217;s possible to check emails.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><em><strong>Experiences:<\/strong><\/em><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Taste Thieboudienne<\/strong> (Tiep\u00a0or\u00a0thieb)\u00a0is a traditional dish from the\u00a0Sahel, especially from\u00a0Senegal\u00a0and\u00a0Mauritania, and it is a staple in\u00a0Senegal.\u00a0The version of tiep called\u00a0thieboudienne\u00a0or\u00a0chebu jen is prepared with fish, rice and tomato sauce cooked in one pot, and it is considered the national dish. There are also\u00a0tiep yappa\u00a0(with meat) and\u00a0tiep ganaar\u00a0(with chicken). Additional ingredients often include onions, carrots, cabbage,\u00a0cassava, hot pepper, lime and\u00a0peanut oil, and Maggi cubes. These ingredients are common in the country.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Historically, it is served on large trays with the rice on the bottom and the fish, usually\u00a0White grouper\u00a0(Epinephelus aeneus), and the vegetables, many of them whole placed in the center.\u00a0Traditionally it is eaten in a large communal dish with the hand. It is also the symbol of the Senegalese Terranga (hospitality): Family, visiting friends, and\/or guests gather around a single dish (called a bolus) in which everyone is using a spoon (couddou Pulaar) or a piece of bread.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Mauritania \u2013 Nouakchott, Dakhlet Nouadhibou, Inchiri, Trarza<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:
