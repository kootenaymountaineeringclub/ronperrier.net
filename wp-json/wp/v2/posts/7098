After exploring the ridge to the west of the col, we crossed back and continued to the eastern uncairned summit at GR 306-892 (GPS 7452\u2019). <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Having admired Mt. Stanley 1.3 km. to the southeast, we continued down our peak\u2019s NE ridge to a treed col at 6950\u2019 before hustling up 500\u2019 of the south slopes of the summit to the north located at GR 309-899 (GPS 7610\u2019). As the lads fantasized about sled touring in upper Grizzly just to our east, Howie and I built a cairn on this moderately impressive bump. Our pointy entity gave good views as we admired the Mulvey Group, Airy, Ladybird, Faith, Gladstone, and even Mt. Shields. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">After Sacha and Kyle scrambled up a detached tower on the west, we descended the west face and gullies to the cut block and truck to finish off a 5-hour day. This outing was supposed to explore a North Greasybill road (no such thing yet) and access to Sangrida Peak (see Burrell Creek 82E\/9). That might work as a spring ski ascent. Has anyone been up Sangrida? <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Kim Kratky <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>UNNAMED 305891 &amp; 301891 These two peaks of roughly equal height lie 1.5 and 2kms NW of Mt Stanley.
