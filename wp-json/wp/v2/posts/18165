This begs the question whether organic fruits and vegetables are richer in nutrients than their conventional cousins. The short answer is yes\u2014but the long answer is more complex than one might expect.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/header>\n<\/div>\n<section class=\"Article__Content\">Though it might seem counterintuitive, regulations for organic food put out by the U.S. Department of Agriculture don\u2019t focus on the health benefits for the person savoring those peppers and peaches. Instead, the emphasis is on how organic produce is grown, largely by protecting soil through the use of composts and animal manures and eschewing synthetic chemicals (although if invading insects can\u2019t be controlled naturally, pesticides may be allowed).<\/p>\n<p>Yet a key motivator for consumers is the notion that they are healthier to eat, so it&#8217;s important for scientists to understand whether this is true, says Julia Baudry, who has studied the question at the independent National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food, and Environment in France.<\/p>\n<p>Decades of research have muddied the answer. Some, especially earlier studies, found\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/00103627609366634\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">little<\/a>\u00a0nutritional difference between organic and conventional foods. Others declared the upside to be\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/journeytoforever.org\/farm_library\/bobsmith.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vast<\/a>. This disparity likely reflects variations in growing practices at organic farms and, importantly, how nutrition is defined, says David Montgomery, a soil scientist at the University of Washington. \u201cThere are differences with what they are actually measuring and comparing,\u201d he says. \u00ad\u00ad<\/p>\n<p>Overall, after conducting an\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fsufs.2021.699147\/full\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">analysis<\/a>\u00a0for a scientific journal and for his book\u00a0<i>What Your Food Ate<\/i>\u2014and yes, plants dine too, he says\u2014Montgomery determined that crops grown organically and in healthy soil have less pesticide residues and higher amounts of antioxidant-rich phytochemicals such as flavonoids and carotenoids.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne could argue whether the differences are enough to be worried about, but from my perspective, the best level of pesticides in my food is none and best level of phytochemicals is more,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, eating any fruit and vegetable is beneficial. Consuming large amounts of produce has been\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nccih.nih.gov\/health\/antioxidants-in-depth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">linked<\/a>\u00a0to everything from heart health to a reduced cancer risk. The average American gets just\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/mmwr\/volumes\/71\/wr\/mm7101a1.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10 percent<\/a>\u00a0of the recommended daily amounts for vegetables and 12 percent for fruit.<\/p>\n<h2>Lower cancer and other disease rates<\/h2>\n<p>Certified organic produce has been readily available only for around two decades, says Dave Chapman, a longtime organic farmer in Vermont. Annual sales of all organic food products (produce, milk, and more) have now reached\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ers.usda.gov\/topics\/natural-resources-environment\/organic-agriculture\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$52 billion<\/a>, nearly double the rate of a decade ago but still just\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/244393\/share-of-organic-sales-in-the-united-states\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">six percent<\/a>\u00a0of the U.S. food market. Overall, organic foods cost about\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ers.usda.gov\/publications\/pub-details\/?pubid=45550\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">20 percent<\/a>\u00a0more than their conventional counterparts, in part because it is more costly to produce.<\/p>\n<p>The initial studies sparking confusion about a health dividend limited their analyses to vitamins, minerals, and macronutrients (such as carbohydrates and protein). This was done because the government has set recommended daily amounts for these, Montgomery says.<\/p>\n<p>A 2012 review of 200 prior studies confirmed that levels of vitamins like A and C and minerals, including calcium and iron, were\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.acpjournals.org\/doi\/10.7326\/0003-4819-157-5-201209040-00007\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">not meaningfully different<\/a>\u00a0between organic and conventional fare.<\/p>\n<p>Less of a concern in those studies were phytochemicals, the compounds abundant in produce that reduce inflammation, strengthen the immune system, and otherwise promote health, since they don\u2019t have a recommended dietary allowance.<\/p>\n<p>When researchers focused specifically on these compounds, they found organic produce is\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/07352689.2011.554417\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">12 percent<\/a>\u00a0richer in them, including having\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2071-1050\/10\/1\/272\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">higher levels<\/a>\u00a0of carotenoids. And people fed three weeks of conventional food and then three weeks of organics had\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/jf030217n\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">higher<\/a>\u00a0levels of flavonoids in their urine following the organic meals.<\/p>\n<p>This makes sense, Montgomery says, because plants ramp up levels of these compounds to protect themselves from insects and disease. Conventionally grown crops don\u2019t need to do this because they are guarded by the synthetic chemicals.<\/p>\n<p>Extra phytochemicals may be one reason Baudry\u2019s observational studies have found the lowest rates of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jamainternalmedicine\/fullarticle\/2707948\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">breast and other cancers<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12966-020-01038-y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">type 2 diabetes<\/a>\u00a0in people who eat the most organic foods. Some scientists fault observational research because people who regularly eat organic differ in so many ways from those who don\u2019t. They are generally wealthier and more highly educated, for example, and they tend to boost their health by exercising regularly.<\/p>\n<p>Baudry says she and her colleagues were careful to take all this into account. \u201cWe are quite confident we are controlling for right range of factors in this research,\u201d she says. Still, such studies can\u2019t prove causation. As the researchers state in their\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S2161831322005373\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">summary<\/a>, to be able to say that eating organic\u00a0<i>leads<\/i>\u00a0to lower rates of disease, direct experiments would need to be conducted.<\/p>\n<p>The better health of people in Baudry\u2019s research likely also results from what organic produce largely does not contain: synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. The 2012 review found pesticide residue on conventional produce to be 30 percent higher than on organics, while other researchers measured\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/core\/journals\/british-journal-of-nutrition\/article\/higher-antioxidant-and-lower-cadmium-concentrations-and-lower-incidence-of-pesticide-residues-in-organically-grown-crops-a-systematic-literature-review-and-metaanalyses\/33F09637EAE6C4ED119E0C4BFFE2D5B1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">48 percent more<\/a>\u00a0of the metal cadmium\u2014a toxin found in some fertilizers that can accumulate in people\u2019s liver and kidneys.<\/p>\n<p>Most studies on risks from these chemicals have been done on farmworkers, as they have vastly more exposure. One 2022 report documented\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fpubh.2022.802810\/full\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">health problems<\/a>\u00a0ranging from poor concentration and neurological symptoms to chest pain in farmers using organophosphate chemicals. In fact, the World Health Organization calls some of these insecticides\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/publications.iarc.fr\/549\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">probable carcinogens<\/a>. Still, chemical levels on conventionally grown crops generally fall below legal safety thresholds.<\/p>\n<h2>Going beyond organics with regenerative agriculture<\/h2>\n<p>For the healthiest food, people should look beyond whether something is labeled as organic and learn how the food was grown, says Tim LaSalle, cofounder of the Center for Regenerative Agriculture and Resilient Systems at California State University, Chico.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that the law and regulations regarding organic foods focus on soil quality. Chapman, a co-executive director of the Real Organic Project, likens the diversity of microorganisms in healthy soil to the range found in our intestines. \u201cIf our microbiome is not healthy, we\u2019re not healthy,\u201d he says. \u201cThe same is true for soil.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why Chapman faults the USDA for allowing plants grown hydroponically\u2014that is, without any soil\u2014to be labeled as organic. Hydroponic plants are fed artificially, typically with nitrogen. \u201cThe plants are hanging in the air and the nutrition basically comes from an IV tube,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is nobody\u2019s idea of grandpa\u2019s garden.\u201d Chapman laments the large number of major food companies whose organic produce is grown this way.<\/p>\n<p>Consumers wanting crops grown in the best soil should look for those from regenerative agriculture, LaSalle says, whether they are certified organic or not. This movement emphasizes soil quality and, while it does not require abstaining from pesticides and herbicides, such an ecosystem typically reduces the need for them, he says.<\/p>\n<p>Farmers practicing regenerative farming follow three basic principles: they don\u2019t turn over, or till, the land before planting because that kills organisms living near the surface; they employ several species of cover crops between growing seasons because their roots feed the soil with varying compounds; and they keep plants in the ground as many days of the year as possible, rather than letting it lie fallow between crops.<\/p>\n<p>These strategies increase the network of fungi and the numbers of earthworms and other organisms below the surface that bring additional nutrients to the plants. A field of broccoli and cauliflower cultivated in soil improved in this way would lead to a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00394-004-0498-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ten-fold increase<\/a>\u00a0in phytochemical levels in these vegetables, according to an article in the\u00a0<i>European Journal of Nutrition<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>The term\u00a0<i>regenerative<\/i>\u00a0is not regulated, however, so people can (and do) put that label on foods that don\u2019t qualify, Chapman laments. (<i>Organic<\/i> is a legal term, although Chapman says enforcement is lax, especially on imported grains.)<\/p>\n<p>To find the healthiest\u2014and tastiest\u2014produce this summer, then, LaSalle advises going to your local farmer\u2019s market. While there, ask the farmers not only whether they avoid pesticides but also whether they till their land and what they do with it between growing seasons.<\/p>\n<p>But Britt Burton-Freeman, director of the Illinois Institute of Technology\u2019s Center for Nutrition Research, worries the focus on organics may be keeping people from eating enough fruits and vegetables. In her survey of 510 low-income shoppers\u2014most of whom said they preferred organic but couldn\u2019t afford it\u2014talk of pesticides made some\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nutritiontodayonline\/Fulltext\/2016\/09000\/Low_Income_Shoppers_and_Fruit_and_Vegetables__What.6.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">less likely<\/a>\u00a0to want to buy produce at all. \u201cFood marketers need to have a clearer understanding of how their messages may influence produce consumption,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>People who can afford well-grown organic foods need to decide for themselves whether they are worth the extra money, Montgomery says. \u201cBut if you want to eat the healthiest that you can, you would prioritize a diet rich in whole, fresh foods grown on healthy, fertile soils.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<\/article>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Is organic food healthier?
