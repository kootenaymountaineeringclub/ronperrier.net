Make reservations a few days in advance. The boat moorage is good. The beach is mixed rock and sand. The trail was not cleared in 2017 but was in 2020 (the description below is pre-renovation &#8211; the trail is clear to the top.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Route\/Trail<\/strong>: There is a campground at the Sharp Creek trailhead just above the sandy beach. The trail ascends steeply through a thin forest with lush undergrowth. Sign at 2km \u2013 975m (3200\u2019) \u2013 about an hour up. Soon enter the first hanging valley for level walking for 10 minutes. Then begin a switchbacking ascent into the denser forest heading west.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong> 2.7km<\/strong> 1098m. Cross a minor rockslide. Ten minutes later, a left spur leads 30m to a cascade on Sharp Creek.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong> 4km.<\/strong> Route steepens gaining 305m in the next 1.3km to reach the second hanging valley for 15 minutes. At 1402m (4600&#8242;), the trail passes through huge cedars and hemlocks. 4 hours. In 2011, there were two large blowdowns in this area.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> 6.5km 1524m (5000\u2019). Leave forest and ascend a steep broad avalanche path and a twin waterfall in the distance. The trail disappears; don&#8217;t go too far west and work way up to intersect the trail at 5500&#8242;. At 1677 m, leave the brush, and re-enter the cool forest. Ruins of old cabin at the 1,920 m level and the end of the trail. The usual campsite is 1.8 km and 240 m elevation gain beyond the trail end.<br \/>\nNear 1951m (6400\u2019), the ascent eases. Pass the campsite near two old cabin remains. At 2088m (6850\u2019), enter the open, subalpine forest and follow cairns up the boulders.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> 5-6 hours. Nearing the top, arrive at the upper basin beneath New Denver Glacier. Cross a boulder field and a meadow and aim for a saddle to the west.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong> 9km<\/strong> 2256m (7400\u2019). After 15 minutes in the basin, reach a subalpine meadow beside Sharpe Creek. Cross the creek and scramble 100m SW up to a good viewpoint. Iron Peak is north, English Peak is west\/southwest and Mt Denver is southwest. It is possible to camp in the meadow.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Head generally west ascending through boulders, krummholtz and heather to reach a 2338m (7670\u2019) saddle between Iron Peak to the NE and English Peak to the SW. Just below the saddle is a small, unnamed lake.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Climb Iron Peak, then retrace your step back to the col and climb English Peak, then Mount Denver.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Consider following the ridge west to get to Mt Meers and Wee Sandy Lake. A loop via Wee Sandy Creek Trail and the wagon road just above the lake could be completed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>References:<br \/>\nNorth Slocan Trail Society<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Looking across Slocan Lake from New Denver, your eyes are inevitably drawn up to the New Denver Glacier.
