It is also one of the main tourist destinations in\u00a0Brazil. The\u00a0state capital\u00a0is the city of\u00a0Fortaleza, the country&#8217;s fourth most populous city. The state has 4,3% of the Brazilian population and produces only 2,1% of the Brazilian\u00a0GDP.<br \/>\nLiterally, means turquoise or green waters.<br \/>\nThe state is best known for its extensive coastline, with 600 kilometers (370\u00a0mi) of sand. There are also mountains and valleys producing\u00a0tropical fruits. To the south, on the border of\u00a0Para\u00edba,\u00a0Pernambuco\u00a0and\u00a0Piau\u00ed, is the National\u00a0Forest\u00a0of\u00a0Araripe.<br \/>\n<strong>Geography.<\/strong> Cear\u00e1 lies partly upon the northeast slope of the\u00a0Brazilian Highlands, and partly upon the sandy coastal plain. Its surface is a succession of great terraces, facing north and northeast, formed by the denudation of the ancient sandstone plateau which once covered this part of the continent; the terraces are seamed by watercourses, and their valleys are broken by hills and ranges of highlands.<br \/>\nCear\u00e1 has a varied environment, with\u00a0mangroves,\u00a0caatinga,\u00a0jungle,\u00a0scrubland\u00a0and tropical\u00a0forest. The higher ranges intercept considerable moisture from the prevailing trade winds, and their flanks and valleys are covered with a\u00a0tropical forest\u00a0which is typical of the region, gathering species from tropical forests,\u00a0caatinga\u00a0and\u00a0cerrado.<br \/>\nThe beaches of the state are a major tourist attraction. Cear\u00e1 has several famous beaches such as\u00a0Canoa Quebrada,\u00a0Jericoacoara,\u00a0Morro Branco,\u00a0Ta\u00edba\u00a0and\u00a0Flexeiras.<br \/>\n<strong>Climate.<\/strong> The climate of Cear\u00e1 is hot almost all year. The temperature in the state varies from 22 to 36\u00a0\u00b0C (72 to 97\u00a0\u00b0F). The coast is hot and humid, tempered by the cool trade winds; in the more elevated, semi-arid regions it is very hot and dry (often above 22\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u00a0\u00b0F), but seldom above 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F)). The year is divided into a rainy and dry season, the rains beginning in January to March and lasting until June.<br \/>\n<strong>History. <\/strong>The territory of Cear\u00e1 was originally inhabited by different Indian peoples. The earliest Portuguese settlement was made near the mouth of the Cear\u00e1 River in 1603, abandoned Cear\u00e1 because of a period of drought,<br \/>\nAt this time, what is today Brazil was hotly disputed by the\u00a0Dutch\u00a0and the Portuguese. The area was invaded twice by the Dutch, in 1637 and in 1649. In 1661, the Netherlands formally ceded their Brazilian territories to the Portuguese crown.<br \/>\nThe fight for Brazilian independence in 1822 was fierce in Cear\u00e1, with the area being a rebel stronghold that incurred vicious retribution from loyalists. Cear\u00e1 became the first province of Brazil to abolish slavery, on March 25, 1884,<br \/>\nSince 1960, the\u00a0Or\u00f3s Dam, comparable in size to the\u00a0Aswan Dam\u00a0has supplied Cear\u00e1 with much of its water, and in 1995 construction began on the enormous\u00a0Castanh\u00e3o Dam, completed in 2003, which is able to hold 6.5\u00a0km\u00b3 of water.<br \/>\n<strong>Demographics<\/strong>. 5,370,000\u00a0Brown\u00a0(Multiracial) people (63.39%), 2,800,000\u00a0White\u00a0people (33.05%), 257,000\u00a0Black\u00a0people (3.03%), 28,000\u00a0Asian\u00a0people (0.33%), 12,000\u00a0Amerindian\u00a0people (0.14%).[8]<br \/>\n<strong>Economy.<\/strong> The\u00a0service sector\u00a0is the largest component of\u00a0GDP\u00a0at 56.7%, followed by the\u00a0industrial sector\u00a0at 37.9%.\u00a0Agriculture\u00a0represents 5.4% of\u00a0GDP\u00a0(2004).

Among the main world producers, Brazil has the lowest productivity. Several factors are pointed out as the cause of the low productivity and the fall in the Brazilian production of cashew nuts. One reason is that most orchards are in a phase of the natural decline in production. In addition, the giant cashew trees, which are the majority in the Region, are exploited in an almost extractive manner, with low use of technology.<\/p>\n<p><em>From Teresina, I caught the bus at 11 am (Real Maia, 150 BR, 480 km, 10 \u00bd hours) to Fortaleza.

The state is famed for its beaches and\u00a0sand dunes, and the air is, according to\u00a0NASA, the second-cleanest in the world after\u00a0Antarctica.<br \/>\n<strong>Two climates<\/strong> predominate: humid tropical, in the oriental\u00a0littoral, and semi-arid, in the remaining (most part) of the State (including the North coast). The rainforest which once covered most of Brazil&#8217;s coast had its northern end in the south of Rio Grande do Norte; the area north of Natal, the capital, is under dunes, a kind of formation associated with a semi-arid climate. The semi-arid climate is characterized not only by the low level but also the irregularity of rainfall; some years can go by with no or very little rain; most of the interior of the State is part of the Polygon of Droughts. There are also many\u00a0mangroves\u00a0in the state, and the interior is dominated by\u00a0rainforests.\u00a0Rocas Atoll\u00a0in the Atlantic Ocean, 260\u00a0km Northeast of\u00a0Natal, also belongs to the state of Rio Grande do Norte. It is contained in the fully protected\u00a0Atol das Rocas Biological Reserve.<br \/>\n<strong>History.<\/strong> The first European to reach the region may have been the\u00a0Spaniard\u00a0Alonso de Ojeda\u00a0in 1499. For decades thereafter, no permanent European settlement was established in the area, inhabited by the\u00a0Potiguar\u00a0tribe.<br \/>\nIn the 16th century (between 1535 and 1598), it was explored by French pirates in search of\u00a0brazilwood. In 1598, the\u00a0Portuguese\u00a0built the\u00a0<i>Forte dos Reis Magos<\/i>\u00a0and, in the following year, founded the city of\u00a0Natal. Raising cattle and sugarcane plantations lifted the local development and economy.<br \/>\nIn 1633, the area became a battleground between the expansionist Portuguese, seeking to take more land for their Brazilian territories, and the Dutch, who gained a foothold in South America.<br \/>\nAfter a short period of peace and prosperity in\u00a0Olinda\u00a0and\u00a0Recife, the sugar prices went down in the market of Amsterdam and the region entered into a serious economic crisis. The economic problems led the Portuguese settlers and native Brazilians to revolt against the Dutch in what is known today as the massacres of\u00a0Cunha\u00fa\u00a0and\u00a0Urua\u00e7u.<br \/>\nThe religious confrontations (the Portuguese-Brazilian Catholicism and the Dutch\u00a0Calvinism), Portugal&#8217;s restoration of the throne in 1640 and the reconquest of\u00a0Maranh\u00e3o\u00a0in 1643, lead the Portuguese-Brazilians to undertake the 1645 uprising,\u00a0In 1654, the Dutch were finally cast out.<br \/>\nDuring World War II, Rio Grande do Norte was used as an\u00a0Allied\u00a0airbase from which to launch\u00a0air raids\u00a0on German-occupied North Africa.<br \/>\nIn 1964, Latin America&#8217;s first\u00a0space launch\u00a0site was constructed in Rio Grande do Norte;\u00a0<i>Barreira do Inferno<\/i>\u00a0(Hell&#8217;s Barrier), which was often referred to as the &#8220;Brazilian\u00a0NASA&#8221;.<br \/>\n<strong>Demographics.<\/strong> Population 3,168,133.

The state is home to 1.9% of the Brazilian population and produces 0.9% of the Brazilian\u00a0GDP.<br \/>\nPara\u00edba is most populated along the Atlantic coast, which extends as far as\u00a0Ponta do Seixas, the easternmost point of the\u00a0Americas. The state is a tourist and industrial hotspot; it is known for its cultural heritage, amenable climate and geographical features, ranging from the seaside beaches to the\u00a0Borborema Plateau. It is named after the\u00a0Para\u00edba river.<br \/>\n<strong>History.<\/strong> In the mid-16th century, settlers from\u00a0Spain\u00a0and\u00a0Portugal,\u00a0Olinda\u00a0and\u00a0Itamarac\u00e1\u00a0founded Filip\u00e9ia de Nossa Senhora das Neves (today\u00a0Jo\u00e3o Pessoa) at the mouth of the\u00a0Para\u00edba do Norte River.<br \/>\nThe area soon proved perfect for\u00a0sugar\u00a0production, with the\u00a0French, the\u00a0Dutch\u00a0and the Portuguese all constantly fighting to control the Para\u00edba region to grow the lucrative\u00a0sugarcane\u00a0in. The fortress of Santa Catarina, near Jo\u00e3o Pessoa, was built to protect the city from the Dutch, who soon became a threat to Portuguese supremacy in Brazil.<br \/>\n<strong>Geology.<\/strong> Has a small mountain range what some consider to be the finest\u00a0tourmaline\u00a0crystals ever found.
