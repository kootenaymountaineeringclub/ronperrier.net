There was no need to change buses. I stopped briefly in Johor Bahru and had a brief look around. The 5 hour trip to Kuala Lumpur was on a great 6 lane divided highway with little traffic and no towns until KL was approached. The minimally rolling terrain was covered with forests and miles of palm oil plantations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>KUALA LUMPUR<\/strong>\u00a0(pop 1.5 million) is a big modern city very similar to Singapore but without all the rules and more traffic and people (the metro in Singapore is so good that most of the citizens are invisible underground). I stayed at the Reggae Mansion, a big and beautiful &#8220;party&#8221; hostel. It is just north of Chinatown and close to all the sites, most of which I was able to see in a few hours in the heat.<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"http:\/\/www.kuala-lumpur.ws\/where-to-stay.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwj3g43UrrjfAhXHh1QKHVKQCxwQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"http:\/\/static.asiawebdirect.com\/m\/kl\/portals\/kuala-lumpur-ws\/homepage\/where-to-stay\/pagePropertiesImage\/kuala-lumpur.jpg.jpg\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"665\" height=\"374\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Masjid Jamek<\/strong>, set in a grove of palm trees beside the concrete enclosed river, is lovely with onion domes and minarets of layered pink and cream bricks.<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/xshamx\/5789484038\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwjCk-LJrLjfAhUQx58KHbsRAKkQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3593\/5789484038_a5c0410435_b.jpg\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"561\" height=\"374\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nI walked through Chinatown to the <strong>Old Railway Station<\/strong>, a fanciful castle of Islamic arches and spires.<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.homedit.com\/kuala-lumpur-railway-station-an-architectural-jewel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwjszM2ErbjfAhUNFHwKHQKUBnIQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.homedit.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/02\/327.jpg\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nNearby is the <strong>Masjid Negara<\/strong> or National Mosque.

I thought it would be nice at night but maybe the views would have been better during the day with more detail and a view to the horizons.

This area is a great reprieve from the heat of the rest of Malaysia, with temperatures that rarely drop below 10C or go above 21. Most come here to trek on the many trails or visit tea plantations and farms. With a pleasant young German, we did Path 1 that climbed up a steep, muddy, path full of roots to <strong>Gunung Brinchang<\/strong>, a 6,666&#8242; mountain north of town. Arriving in the mist, we walked down to the Mossy Forest boardwalk, and then down the steep road. With a bunch of other young guys we hitched a ride through big tea plantations back to the main road and to Tanah Rata.<br \/>\nThis has been a nice relaxing place with a welcome cool climate and great company. With only 6 days left in this winter&#8217;s trip, I decided to move on to the east coast and the town of Kuala Besut, the jetty town for boats to the Perhentian Islands for some snorkelling and possibly diving.<\/p>\n<p><strong>PERHENTIAN ISLANDS<\/strong><br \/>\nThe brand new Toyota minivan was a pleasant surprise and it was a comfortable 5 hour drive with four unusually nice French travellers who made a real effort to include me in the conversation. The road moved through huge oil palm plantations.<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"http:\/\/www.indonesiastudents.com\/pulau-kecil-pengertian-masalah-dan-postensinya-lengkap\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwiyi6T8tbjfAhVqITQIHR55CkoQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"http:\/\/www.indonesiastudents.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/pengertian-pulau-kecil.jpg\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"540\" height=\"374\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nIn Kuala Besut, it was a quick transfer to the water taxi for a half hour ride to Long Beach on <strong>Pelau Kecil<\/strong>, the most &#8220;backpacker&#8221; of the Perhentian group of islands. I stayed the first night at Perhentian Tropicana, but it was disappointing &#8211; no wifi, power on only at night, no A\/C, and a very plain room for $25, a relatively high room rate for Malaysia. Coral Bay, a 10 minute walk across the island, was much nicer and that is where I spent all my time as it was wifi enabled. All the beachfront restaurants have a BBQ at night. It always feels odd to be the only one sitting alone out of hundreds of others &#8211; mostly twenty-somethings and a few families.<\/p>\n<p>The next day I went snorkelling to five sites with imaginative names like Fish Point, Shark Point and Turtle Bay (yes there was a very cooperative turtle). The Lighthouse site had gorgeous fish &#8211; schools of little fish that you felt you were fighting your way through and loads of other larger fish. I upgraded my hotel to one on Coral Bay (the huge Shangri=La resort), with A\/C and wifi in an attractive room for $25\/night. I went diving to a ship wreck called Sugar Wreck that sunk in 2000. It was a cargo ship that carried sugar. Only about 20m deep, it was my first wreck and quite interesting with lots of fish and urchins. The third day, I went diving again to a pinnacle called Temple. Again there were many interesting fish but mediocre corals.<\/p>\n<p><strong>PENANG<\/strong><br \/>\nSo after four days of the beach life, I caught the 8AM water taxi back to Kuala Besut and then another minivan 6 hours across the entire peninsula to the west coast and <strong>Penang<\/strong>. An island accessed by one of the longest bridges in the world at 13.5km, it was listed as a World Heritage Site in 2008. I was the only one in the 9 passenger van &#8211; how do they make money at this? It was a similar landscape with trees and oil palm plantations. The main city is <strong>Georgetown<\/strong> (pop 180,000), a big city with a big cultural mishmash. Outside the historic centre with its chaotic streets and allies and British Raj-era architecture, are soaring skyscrapers and massive shopping complexes.<\/p>\n<p>My last day in SE Asia was spent sightseeing in Georgetown. I hit the best roti canai stall in town for a great lunch. The <strong>Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion<\/strong> was built over 8 years by a Chinese wealthy mandarin, finishing in 8 years in 1888 (8 is a very lucky number in Chinese culture). With 38 rooms, wonderful stained glass, Scottish wrought iron, paste and glue ceramic dioramas, and a blue paint scheme, the 1 hour guided was well done.<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tripadvisor.com.my\/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g298303-d564445-i150985140-Cheong_Fatt_Tze_The_Blue_Mansion-George_Town_Penang_Island_Penang.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwiWucfst7jfAhUeIDQIHRFyA3wQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-s\/08\/ff\/d9\/b4\/the-blue-mansion-by-samadhi.jpg\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"550\" height=\"310\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nThe <strong>Penang Museum<\/strong> illustrates the customs and traditions of Penang&#8217;s ethnic groups (Malay, Chinese and Indian), a worthwhile museum to visit.

The Vancouver airport is one of the loveliest in the world with all the glass, water features, and Indian carvings. The Canada Line to Broadway, bus 99 to Commercial and a 3 block walk to get to my lovely daughters house. A gorgeous walk on the sea wall on a warm, sunny day in Vancouver, dinner at Vij&#8217;s (lamb popsicles are so yummy). So nice to be home.
