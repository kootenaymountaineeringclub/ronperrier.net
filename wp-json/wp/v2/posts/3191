So, these plans may not work for you if you spend too much time abroad or don&#8217;t use Google Fi or T-Mobile as your primary plan in the U.S.<br \/>\nMany phones hold a physical SIM card but also supports eSIM. When Google Fi fails to provide international data, purchase an eSIM from the Airalo app. Airalo lets me buy data for most destinations at a lower cost than Google Fi was charging me. If your phone doesn&#8217;t support eSIM, buy a physical SIM card once you land at your destination&#8217;s airport.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nMobile phone compatibility<br \/>\n<\/strong>When buying a local or global SIM card you need to make sure your phone is unlocked and that it&#8217;s compatible with your destination country&#8217;s radio frequency.<br \/>\nFirstly, to use a travel SIM in your device, you&#8217;ll need to make sure that your handset is network unlocked. When you buy a device through a carrier, it&#8217;s usually &#8216;locked&#8217; to that network &#8211; meaning you can&#8217;t simply take your phone and use it on a rival carrier&#8217;s plan. Depending on who your original carrier is, you may be able to have your phone unlocked by the cell company themselves, or give the company\u2019s customer service hotline a call or visit their website. Unlocking iPhones can be done by contacting your carrier, but they will forward the request to Apple to be processed; alternatively, you can fill out an online form. If your phone is locked, one option is to buy a cheap unlocked international phone (G3 Wireless, Motorola) to use specifically for your trip.<br \/>\nAs well as a phone unlock, you&#8217;ll also need to ensure that your device will work on a GSM network. Most of the countries you&#8217;re likely to visit (with the exception of maybe Japan and Korea) use the GSM standard for mobile devices. in the US carriers rely on two different types of technology &#8211; GSM (AT&amp;T and T-Mobile) or CDMA (Sprint, Verizon). GSM compatible phones use a SIM card &#8211; a small removable card that stores customer information, but CDMA phones may not have a SIM card slot.<br \/>\nDifferent countries operate their mobile networks on different radio frequencies. Most modern mobile phones, brought in the UK, will support the three major international frequencies, but you will need to check to make sure.<br \/>\nAs a general guide, if your phone is &#8216;quad band&#8217; then you should be able to use it anywhere apart from non-GSM countries like Japan (though if your phone supports 3G connectivity it should work in Japan). If it is &#8216;tri band&#8217; then you will be able to use it in most countries apart from a small selection in South America. If your phone is &#8216;dual band&#8217; then it will work across Europe, but you will have problems using it in the US.<br \/>\nTo get a complete run down of the different radio frequencies for each country see GSM World&#8217;s official list. You can find out your mobile phone\u2019s frequency in the specifications part of our mobile phone reviews or by searching on the internet for the device&#8217;s specifications<br \/>\nSome countries have blocks on phones used there and require registration (Turkey requires registration, even when a local SIM is used; Italy requires registration with your passport and activation takes 24 hours). And in some countries, global SIMs do not work at all.<br \/>\nDo pay careful attention to data plans if using a Smartphone. It&#8217;s easier than you might think to chew up a data plan when you may be accustomed to unlimited data.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. NO PHONE<\/strong><br \/>\nThe cheapest option is to just leave your phone at home and hope for frequent Internet access. Skype or FaceTime will always be the cheapest way to make a phone call and there is the option of video calls. This would be unacceptable to many and you would lose some of the most useful features: Google Earth, translation apps, a camera and everything else a smart phone can offer a traveller.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. LOCAL SIM CARDS<\/strong><br \/>\nIf your phone is unlocked (you\u2019re able to use SIM cards from different cell companies), then it\u2019s possible to buy a local SIM card and\/or an international calling card when you arrive at your destination country. This is by far the cheapest option out there, especially for longer-term travel. It usually costs $2-$10 to buy a local SIM card \u2014 which you can then refill with minutes on demand. It is easier than it sounds.<br \/>\nYou\u2019re guaranteed much cheaper calls to local numbers, but you will have to pay extra to call internationally. The other benefit of using a local foreign SIM card, is that you should never have to pay for receiving calls from home (though the person calling you will have to pay extra to make an international call!).<br \/>\nThe downside to local SIM cards is that they can sometimes be confusing. Why do prepaid minutes would magically disappear in Central American countries? Turns out they were only good for a week before they expired. Every company will have it\u2019s own special rules that you\u2019ll need to learn about, which may be difficult if you don\u2019t speak the language.<br \/>\nBefore buying a local SIM card, try to research which company has the best coverage for the particular area you\u2019ll be traveling in. You can go online and ask other travelers who\u2019ve been there recently, or wait until you arrive and ask locals which provider they use.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. GLOBAL SIM CARDS<\/strong><br \/>\nGlobal SIM cards are best for travelers who are visiting many different countries on different networks in a short period of time. Because it is the same SIM card, you\u2019ll have the same phone number, can roam everywhere, have access to voice, texting, and data, and spend a lot less on your cell service.<br \/>\nTake your own cellphone with you swapping your regular SIM card for a specially made global or travel SIM bought in advance of your trip with known rates that are appealingly lower than what your home mobile provider offers. Pay as you go and only put money on when you need it.<br \/>\nIt\u2019s easy to understand the draw of these. If you\u2019ve not traveled, there can be anxiety when travelling to a foreign country, finding the local mobile provider, hoping they speak enough English to help you, and so on. The pre-travel jitters get the best of all of us, and being able to put one thing aside before you arrive, namely your phone\u2019s data\/voice connection, is appealing.<br \/>\nBut how good are international or travel SIMs? The short answer? Not very. The longer answer? It depends. The little bit of stress relief before you leave is going to cost you in the long run. Most services charge you for the SIM itself, adding more to the overall price. Global SIM cards usually offer cheaper international calls and texts than your home network. However, this depends on what country you are in.<br \/>\nFor instance, if you&#8217;re travelling across more than one European country, the rates in Europe are usually cheap and you won&#8217;t have to change SIM cards when you enter different countries. In this instance, global SIM-cards offer good value for money with significantly cheaper rates and you will usually be able to receive texts free of charge.<br \/>\nBut if, for instance, you are visiting just one country in Asia, such as Thailand or India, then it would be a better idea to buy a local SIM card, as you only need coverage for a single country and global SIM call rates are more expensive in Asia. In Thailand, the cost of making calls is almost the same as roaming with a home SIM card. So when it comes to global SIM cards you really should check what rates will apply in the countries you&#8217;re visiting, this information should be available on the seller&#8217;s website.<br \/>\nYou also need to think about who you will be calling while abroad. If you plan on making more calls to local numbers, then a local SIM card is a better option. If you expect friends and family to call you from home then a global SIM card will usually minimise their costs more than a local SIM will.<br \/>\nIt is also worth thinking about how you will top-up your SIM card. A global SIM card will usually allow you to top-up online or over the phone with a credit or debit card. For local SIM cards you will probably need to top-up via vouchers bought in-store.<br \/>\nAnother advantage to global SIM-cards is that if something goes wrong while topping-up, or you need help using phone services, the customer support will always be in English.<br \/>\nDecide on if you need data and\/or voice. Some people just use data as that is what most people need on the road. Some buy only voice for calling hotels etc and occasional calls home, not for data. They travel with a laptop using hotels with wi-fi for email and data connections.<br \/>\nTravel SIMs aren&#8217;t the perfect option for everyone, but if you&#8217;re thinking about giving one a try, the most common carriers are GO-SIM, WorldSIM (many travellers experience nothing but frustration with this company), OneSimCard, Plus SIM, Telestial, eKit, GigSky, G3, Vodafone, TravelSIM and many others. The cost of plans vary and you must simply check each one to find the best value if you decide to go with a travel SIM.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. INTERNATIONAL ROAMING<\/strong><br \/>\nIf you have a cell phone plan with a major carrier in the US, Canada or Europe, you can usually continue to use your phone while traveling overseas. Keeping the same phone number and text address can be extremely convenient. But it can also be astronomically expensive. You can easily return home to a phone bill that costs more than your whole vacation did!<br \/>\nBut if you\u2019re traveling overseas for a short period of time (a week), and don\u2019t plan on using your phone much, it might be the best option. Just make sure to keep the phone in \u201cairplane mode\u201d when not in use, otherwise you can rack up big fees without knowing it.<br \/>\nIt\u2019s wise to call your provider to make sure the phone will even work at your planned destination, and confirm how much their international plans cost if not included in your regular service.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. ON A CRUISE<\/strong><br \/>\nMost travelers depend on their cellphones for directions, photos, recommendations, wake-up alarms and ride hailing, not to mention calls and texts. But if your vacation plans involve a cruise, you will need to consider rethink your phone use. Simply put, you can\u2019t use a cellphone on a cruise the way you can on land without incurring outrageous roaming charges.<br \/>\n<strong>Do cellphones work on cruise ships?\u00a0<\/strong>Yes, you can make calls, text, and even video chat from a cruise ship. In port, you can connect to local roaming networks. At sea, you can either make calls via a satellite connection or pay for the ship\u2019s Wi-Fi (also via satellite) and make Wi-Fi calls, text or video chat via the internet.<br \/>\nBandwidth and connection speed can be an issue at sea. You may experience lag time on calls or slow connection speeds. Depending on where your ship is in the world and whether anything (like a mountain range) is blocking the connection to the satellite, your phone may not work temporarily for calls or Wi-Fi access.<br \/>\nAny part of your phone that does not require a network (downloads, photo apps, alarm clocks) will function as normal on board.<br \/>\n<strong>How to avoid cellphone charges on a cruise.<\/strong>\u00a0Once you\u2019ve drifted away from the nearest land-based cell tower, however, your phone will go into roaming mode. That\u2019s when hefty charges can start to accrue. We\u2019re not talking about your average international roaming charges, but extra-expensive satellite roaming charges.<br \/>\nSurfing the internet, using social media, reading emails or checking the weather will all use data charged at a premium rate. Phone calls and messages, regardless if they are incoming or outgoing, will also be charged at a premium.<br \/>\nIf you want to avoid extra charges from your mobile phone service provider, put your smartphone on \u201cairplane mode\u201d sometime between boarding and when the ship sets sail. Even if you\u2019re not actively using your phone, your smartphone is constantly utilizing data in the background, racking up charges you\u2019re not even aware of. Better to keep cellular service off.<br \/>\nAirplane mode will switch off your phone\u2019s transmitters for cell signal (calls and text messages) and data (browsing the web, using apps) ensuring you will not be privy to unwanted charges. But don\u2019t worry: Your smartphone won\u2019t be completely useless for the trip. Toggle on the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth features and make use of your phone in other ways.<br \/>\n<strong>What if I accidentally use roaming services while on board?<\/strong> It\u2019s up to you to make sure your phone settings are adjusted to keep you from roaming at sea. Expect an alert via SMS text that you\u2019re headed into roaming territory, but beyond that, service providers won\u2019t necessarily notify you of overages and fees \u2014 you\u2019ll just be surprised with a large charge on your next bill.<br \/>\nKeep a watchful eye on your \u201cairplane mode\u201d setting, ensuring it\u2019s always on when you\u2019re on board your cruise ship. If you forget, you won\u2019t be charged for incoming calls you don\u2019t accept, but some service providers will charge for unread text messages that arrive while your phone is roaming.<br \/>\nUse the ship\u2019s Wi-Fi to monitor usage on your service provider\u2019s app. If something seems off, contact the service provider\u2019s customer service.<br \/>\n<strong>Can I access cruise-specific phone plans and costs?\u00a0<\/strong>If you plan on using your phone at sea, some service providers have cruise-specific plans available for when you\u2019re at sea. These plans charge a premium for use through the ship\u2019s satellite connection.<br \/>\nOnce you\u2019re in port, double-check whether your phone is connecting via the ship or the local land-based cell tower. Depending on the port, there might not be land-based reception. Cruise versus land-based roaming charges differ, with land-based reception often the less-expensive option.<br \/>\nThese are the major US carrier\u2019s cruise plans. Note the difference between SMS (text only, up to 160 characters long) and MMS (a message that contains media including photos, videos and audio files).\u00a0<strong>Verizon<\/strong>:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.verizon.com\/plans\/international\/international-travel\/cruise-and-inflight\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Verizon\u2019s \u201cPay As You Go\u201d cruise rates.\u00a0<\/a><strong>AT&amp;T<\/strong>:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.att.com\/international\/cruise-packages\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AT&amp;T\u2019s two cruise packages<\/a>\u00a0.\u00a0<strong>T-Mobile (and now Sprint)<\/strong>: T-Mobile doesn\u2019t feature cruise-specific packages.

Check your provider\u2019s international plans and rates for each port you plan to visit on your itinerary.<br \/>\nConsider opting for an international SIM card that can keep you connected while in foreign countries and help with budgeting and allotting usage. International SIM cards offer the benefit of choice and variety, with an open market of plans that fit your budget and usage needs. You\u2019ll be using a different phone number with that new SIM card, but you\u2019ll still be able to access your web-based apps, email, and internet messaging like WhatsApp and Apple\u2019s iMessage.\u00a0<strong>Pro tip<\/strong>: Pack a paper clip to easily eject and swap out SIM cards.<br \/>\n<strong>Can I use the ship&#8217;s wifi on my cellphone?\u00a0<\/strong>Nearly all major cruise lines sailing today have\u00a0ship-wide Wi-Fi\u00a0available. It\u2019s pricey and can be slow or finicky, even on the cruise lines that bill their internet as the \u201cfastest at sea.\u201d However, you can definitely access the ship\u2019s Wi-Fi on your phone if you purchase a plan.<br \/>\nBecause the internet connection comes via satellite, passengers cannot rely on the same high-speed access as land-based, wired providers offer. Activities like video conferencing, high-definition streaming and online gaming are going to be more of a challenge on your phone at sea. Plan for spotty coverage.\u00a0<strong>Related:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/thepointsguy.com\/guide\/free-cruise-wifi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How can I get Wi-Fi on a cruise for free?<\/a><br \/>\n<\/strong>However, depending on the plan you choose, you will be able to text, voice call, video call, check email, and stream music and video. Make sure you have enabled your smartphone\u2019s Wi-Fi calling, texting and video call options, or have downloaded apps to do these things pre-cruise.<br \/>\nDownload your\u00a0cruise line\u2019s app\u00a0prior to boarding, and you\u2019ll be able to browse onboard internet packages available through the ship\u2019s satellite internet service. Most cruise lines offer a few basic web-based services for free via their cruise app, including viewing activity schedules and deck plans, ordering food delivery and making reservations for shows or restaurants. Some even offer in-app texting (sometimes for a minimal fee).<br \/>\n<strong>Related:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/thepointsguy.com\/guide\/ultimate-guide-international-smartphone-use\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The ultimate guide to international smartphone use<\/a><br \/>\nWhat are the best ways to use my cellphone on a cruise?<\/strong>\u00a0Depending on your cruise line\u2019s app, your smartphone might have the ability to unlock your cabin door, help you make dinner reservations, or even order a burger and cocktail to be delivered to you poolside. Just as we\u2019ve seen landside, cruise ships have begun to use QR codes to replace physical bar and restaurant menus.<br \/>\nSmartphones make great cameras for capturing the many fun moments on board and in port. Consider a waterproof case or a plastic waterproof pouch to have the freedom and fun of bringing your phone with you in the ship\u2019s pool and to the beaches at port.<br \/>\nUse your phone as an alarm clock to make sure you\u2019re up at the right time for excursions, pool parties and dinner reservations.<br \/>\nPrior to boarding, always download media (movies, TV shows, music, books, podcasts, etc.) via your fast and cheaper home internet so you will have free entertainment at the ready on your vacation.<br \/>\nBut remember, your cellphone won\u2019t be useful to you if you run out of battery life. Double-check that you have packed the right chargers and outlet plugs, especially for accessories like Bluetooth earphones.<br \/>\nConsider bringing a travel power strip (one without surge protection) if your cabin\u2019s electronic devices will all need to be charged overnight at the same time.
