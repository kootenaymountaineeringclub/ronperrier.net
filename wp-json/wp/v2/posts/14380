The Federated States of Micronesia is spread across part of the\u00a0Caroline Islands\u00a0in the wider region of\u00a0Micronesia, which consists of thousands of small islands divided among several countries. The term\u00a0Micronesia\u00a0may refer to the Federated States or to the region as a whole.<br \/>\nThe FSM was formerly a part of the\u00a0Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands\u00a0(TTPI), a\u00a0United Nations\u00a0Trust Territory under U.S. administration, but it formed its own constitutional government on May 10, 1979, becoming a sovereign state after independence was attained on November 3, 1986, under a\u00a0Compact of Free Association\u00a0with the United States. Other neighboring island entities, and also former members of the TTPI, formulated their own constitutional governments and became the\u00a0Republic of the Marshall Islands\u00a0(RMI) and the\u00a0Republic of Palau\u00a0(ROP).

Turn left and descend left on the path.<\/em><br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nNAN MADOL <\/strong>Ceremonial Centre of Eastern Micronesia. WHS. The ruins of a 1000-year-old royal city, the ceremonial and political seat of the Saudeleur dynasty that united Pohnpei&#8217;s estimated 25,000 people from about AD 500 until 1500, when the centralized system collapsed. It is located on artificial islands linked by canals, (called \u201cthe Venice of the Pacific\u201d, it is the only ancient, ruined city in the world built on top of a coral reef).<br \/>\nIt is a series of canals and islands. that, until the 1600s, housed the royalty of Pohnpei.<br \/>\nConstruction began between 1180-1200 AD. The average weight of each stone is roughly 5 tons with the heaviest being 25 tons. The basalt stones were taken from a volcanic plug located on the other side of Pohnpei. No one knows exactly how the stones were moved but the theory is that the builders from Micronesia\u2019s other state, Kosrae, migrated to Pohnpei and began the construction of Nan Madol.<br \/>\nAlthough much is covered in the jungle or underwater, there are two visitable ruins. The first one is 40 m below the house \u2013 a very large walled compound encircled by a wall made of 5-sided basalt columns \u2013 small diameter columns alternate with large diameters laying in opposite directions. This ruin had 8 layers of columns.<br \/>\nWalk about 10 minutes down an elevated path of rough stones and coral passing through a mangrove swamp with several small bridges to bypass the wet bits. Come to a water channel with a huge ruin across that can be waded at low tide. The channel walls are reinforced with large rocks and more basalt columns \u2013 it extends out to more open water and forms a moat around the large ruin.<br \/>\nThe impressive ruin is called Nan Dowas with stones weighing up to 50 tons. It was supposedly the residence of priests and served as the royal mortuary. It is formed by the same stacking of alternating large and small columns (described as &#8220;header and stretcher patterns&#8221;) sitting on very large boulders. The right-hand corner has 18 layers and the left has 22 layers diminishing in both directions and cut by a wide stairway leading up into the ruin. A few vines drape the outside.<br \/>\nThe whole complex covers more than 100 islets. Nan Madol was designed for water traffic. The islets are surrounded by navigable shallow tidal canals &#8211; even at high tide, they are only waist-deep with a coral bottom. Perhaps this was to prevent enemy ships from making it into the city. The entire complex is surrounded by a massive sea wall on the north-east, south-east and south-west.<br \/>\nI walked down along the channel to see if I could see any more.

Walk up the short driveway and take a nice gravel path right. Walk less than 5 minutes to the fall that cascades over a wide, sloped pyramid of basalt with a shallow pool. It is about 25 m high and quite wide. A pool below can be swam in. There is also a nice shelter with a table on the second floor.<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Return the same way. $10 tourists, $5 expats, $3 locals.<br \/>\n<\/span>I was thinking about going to the petroglyphs in the centre of the island but didn\u2019t and I drove to Palikir.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Palikir.<\/strong> The capital of FSM \u2013 and one of the most unusual. There is a large government complex of nicely designed matching buildings \u2013 yellow bottom with a high black tiled roof \u2013 Supreme Court, Congress, Office of the President and others. Across the road are emergency services, a fire station and a large convention center under construction. And that is virtually the entire \u201ccity\u201d. There are a few widely separated houses (and all these are underwhelming), two churches, and a small school. No business district. It must be the smallest national capital anywhere. It is about 5 km on the other side of the Mangrove from Kolonia.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sokeh Ridge.<\/strong> Sokehs Island is the highest and largest in Pohnpei. It is a long undulating ridge running north-south, with a knoll-like summit near the middle and ending at Sokehs Rock, a band of naked basalt.<br \/>\nThe rock is historically significant for its role in the bloody 1910 Rebellion against the German colonial government and was one of several locations around Pohnpei heavily fortified by the Japanese in WWII. It is also notable for its many outer-island residents who were allowed to settle in Slkahs after most of the Pohnpeian residents were exiled to phosphate mining camps in Palau as punishment for their part in the uprising against the Germans.<br \/>\nIt is 10 minutes by car from Kolonia and has an encircling 9.2 km paved road (except for a 2.3 km section in the north. Head west from Kolonia, turn right after Happy Mart and cross the bridge. Right goes to Sokeh Rock, the sport climbing routes and the waterfalls. Straight goes to the Sekih Mountain trailhead.<br \/>\nThe hike begins above the Municipal Office and climbs steadily along the rocky Japanese Road. At the top is a wall with unpaved basalt stones. The forested part has hardwood trees and bright flowering shrubs.<br \/>\nCoastal Gun Battery. (.23 km) has barracks, concrete water tanks, bomb craters, and a rock and steel bunker that has a 15 cm naval gun to protect Palikir Pass to the west. Its range was not sufficient to reach the 6 American battleships outside the barrier reef that bombarded Pohnpei for 70 straight minutes on May 1, 1944.<br \/>\nThe trail continues .37 km to the end of the ridge passing more war artifacts. The anti-aircraft battery has a 12.7 cm twin double-purpose gun that has a range of almost 7 km. The guns were ineffective against the American bombers out of Tawara and fighter planes from Eniwetuk. Eventually, 118 tons of bombs and 6,000 incendiaries were dropped on Pohnpei.<br \/>\nCamping is allowed here. The best site is the grassy roof of the battery bunker with nice views of the bay but there are other less conspicuous sites.<br \/>\nDrive up, park and do a fun 3-hour round trip hike up the massive rock outcropping for a panoramic view of Pohnpei and WWII-era Japanese guns. A large antenna displays a good light show all night.<br \/>\n<strong>The spire<\/strong> (Paijulap) is a 100 m high exposed basalt volcanic plug. An unmarked trail leading to the Rock, the Spire and Admas Apple begins south of a brown house 1.2 km beyond Mwalok A-1 Store and just before Danipei Church. It has cement steps at the bottom and is a well-defined trail that leads to a section that clambers around a tree and uses roots and fixed ropes to get up a 70-foot section of exposed basalt.<\/p>\n<p><em>I returned to the hotel and continued the slog of \u201crenovating\u201d my hiking book.

They only get to stop over on holidays like this time \u2013 they came here for 4 days to dive.<br \/>\nA major draw of the FSM is surfing. There is only one break \u2013 The Palikir Channel that penetrates the coral reef of the atoll. When good, it is known for its long clean curling barrel waves that are easy to drop into. The last three days have been the best. A guy who lives on the north shore of Oahu showed me some photos \u2013 it looked like magic. He travels to surf all over the world.<br \/>\nDiving is also popular and the shop at the hotel appears to be the most reliable business. People were going out on trips 1-2 times every day.

A decentralized chieftain-based system eventually evolved into a more centralized economic and religious culture centered on Yap Island.<br \/>\nEuropean explorers\u2014first the\u00a0Portuguese\u00a0in search of the\u00a0Spice Islands\u00a0(Indonesia) and then the\u00a0Spanish\u2014reached the\u00a0Carolines\u00a0in the sixteenth century. The\u00a0Treaty of Tordesillas\u00a0gave this lands to\u00a0Spain\u00a0and the Spanish incorporated the archipelago to the\u00a0Spanish East Indies\u00a0through the capital,\u00a0Manila, and in the 19th century established a number of outposts and missions. In 1887, they founded the town of\u00a0Santiago de la Ascension\u00a0in what today is\u00a0Kolonia\u00a0on the island of Pohnpei.<br \/>\nFollowing defeat in the\u00a0Spanish\u2013American War, the Spanish sold the archipelago to\u00a0Germany\u00a0in 1899 under the\u00a0German\u2013Spanish Treaty of 1899. Germany incorporated it into\u00a0German New Guinea.<br \/>\nDuring\u00a0World War I, it was captured by\u00a0Japan. Following the war, the\u00a0League of Nations\u00a0awarded a\u00a0mandate\u00a0for Japan to administer the islands as part of the\u00a0South Seas Mandate.<br \/>\nDuring\u00a0World War II, a significant portion of the Japanese fleet was based in\u00a0Truk Lagoon. In February 1944,\u00a0Operation Hailstone, one of the most important naval battles of the war, took place at Truk, in which many Japanese support vessels and aircraft were destroyed.<br \/>\nFollowing World War II, it was administered by the\u00a0United States\u00a0under\u00a0United Nations\u00a0auspices in 1947 as part of the\u00a0Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands\u00a0pursuant to\u00a0Security Council Resolution 21.<br \/>\nOn May 10, 1979, four of the Trust Territory districts ratified a new constitution to become the Federated States of Micronesia.\u00a0Palau, the\u00a0Marshall Islands, and the\u00a0Northern Mariana Islands\u00a0chose not to participate. The FSM signed a\u00a0Compact of Free Association\u00a0with the United States, which entered into force on November 3, 1986, marking Micronesia&#8217;s emergence from trusteeship to independence. Independence was formally concluded under international law in 1990, when the United Nations officially ended the Trusteeship status pursuant to\u00a0Security Council Resolution 683.
