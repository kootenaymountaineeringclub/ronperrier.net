Navigating by our Creston sheet, we continued along this 2WD \u201chighway\u201d to the junction with Kianuko Creek (km. 22.6), chose the route straight ahead signed \u201cKamma Creek\/Huscroft,\u201d and followed this as it bent east along the north bank of Kamma Creek. At. km. 37.5, we turned left or north at an unsigned junction and made another left at km. 40.5. By now, we were driving through cut blocks and on snow patches. Finally, we were stopped by snow on the road at km. 42.7, GR 549-711, 5400\u2019.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Our goal clearly in sight about 3 km. to the northwest, we set off afoot (we brought skis but decided against their use) at 11:30, walking north and west along the road. At a spot where the road crosses a watercourse (about 541-721), we left the road and followed this creek on snow in a generally WNW direction to the alps below the east face of Armitage. We then continued up an easy buttress to gain the south ridge, which we followed to the summit by 2:30 (3 hours up, all of it a walk-up on snow).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">In fine, shirt-sleeve weather under partly cloudy skies, we hung around for 30 minutes, examining the myriad lady bugs hatching on the summit rocks, contemplating the horn of Haystack Mtn. to the northwest, and identifying the sharp point of Steeple Mtn. on the west side of Kootenay Lake.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">For the descent, we re-traced our steps in good snow conditions, reaching the truck in 1 \u00bd hours, totalling a day on foot of about 5 hours. The drive home went quickly, as I reached Nelson by 7:30 pm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">In sum, we were very fortunate in finding excellent road access, good snow, and a peak easily reached\u2014especially considering this was an area we had no first-hand knowledge of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">NOTE: Mt.
