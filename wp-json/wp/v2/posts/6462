Most day hikers will turn around here.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Backpacking route finders using a topo map and compass or GPS, can leave the trail before it descends and follow the ridge northeast toward tiny Watch Lake. Hikers should contour to the east of the first knob after leaving the trail, then contour to the west side of the ridge for about 1 mile over the talus until they come to the bowl above Watch Lake. Descend to the saddle south of Gypsy Peak and then down to the lake. Carry plenty of water; no reliable source is available until the end of the hike at Watch Lake. This is a fragile camping area, definitely not suitable for groups of more than about 6. The area around the lake can be boggy in July or after heavy rains.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>CROWELL RIDGE This is a scenic, mostly treeless ridge hike in the Salmo-Priest Wilderness.
