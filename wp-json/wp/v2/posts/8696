Visible from many points in the S Purcells, the towers are situated along the upper course of Forest\u00a0Creek, some 12 mi E of Kootenay Lake between the heads of Campbell and Dewar Creeks. The S terminal forks of Forest Creek embrace the group, the W branch being known as Pinnacle Creek. There are several small hanging glaciers on the E side of the group. The Leaning Towers are sculptured from medium to coarse-grained, massively joined granite on the eastern border of the F<sub>ry<\/sub> Creek batholith. This granite is substantially equivalent to that of the Horsethief Creek stock from which the Bugaboo and Vowell Groups rise and offer similar climbing. The writing desk or scissor-like profile the group presents from a distance is attributable to the master joint sets in the granite-\u00b0both strik\u00ading N, one vertical and the other dipping about 45 to the W.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The peaks at the S end of the group (The Molars and those S) have more closely spaced jointing than the N peaks of the Leaning Towers. Also included in this section are various iso\u00adlated summits in the same general area.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>ACCESS.<\/strong> Whichever of the approaches described below is ultimately chosen, one must expect to backpack and bushwhack for a minimum of 2 days, gaining and losing consider\u00ad able elevation in the process. The arduous but only direct approach is from Kaslo, crossing Kootenay Lake (1765) by boat and following Campbell Creek. The BC Forest Service maintains a fire road about 5 mi up Campbell Creek (extended and regraded in 1971 and 1972) to a point just below the unburned timber (4100); 5 hr pack from Kootenay Lake. Continue E either on game trails close to the creek or on higher, burned\u00ad slopes to the creek branch which drains Pinnacle Pass (6700) at the E head of the valley. Stay on the N side of this stream until talus slopes are reached, crossing then to the S side. Ascend to pass (beautiful but marshy campsites); 9 hr from the end of the road. Drop down due E about 1000&#8242; to the top of the large talus slide, then angle NE to more slides leading toward the floor of Pinnacle Creek Valley.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Another approach from Kootenay Lake, via Powder Creek, has a distinct advantage over the Campbell Creek route. The road extending N from Riondel along the E shore of the lake goes up Powder Creek a distance of roughly 5 mi, so it is possible to drive to the end of the road. However, this is counterbalanced by the necessity to cross the divide above Powder Creek into the Campbell Creek drainage in order then to cross Pinnacle Pass, the only easy pass to Pinnacle Creek.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Travel in the Pinnacle Creek valley is tedious and comfort\u00adable campsites hard to find because it is littered with huge boulders and blocks. Customarily, 2 different bases have been used to climb peaks at opposite ends of the group. To reach the S peaks, camps have been placed at the tree line near the stream draining W from below the Wisdom Tooth; 4\u00bd hr from Pinna\u00adcle Pass. To climb the higher N peaks, a camp at approx 8000&#8242; in the NW cirque beneath Hall Peak is advantageous; a half\u00ad day from either Pinnacle Pass or camp at the S end of the group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Peaks along the ridges which run perpendicular to the main N-S axis, at the S end of the group, have been climbed from a camp S of that E-W ridge, beside an aquamarine lake in a cirque above headwaters of the St Mary River. Although this spot was reached from the W via Pinnacle Creek, a direct approach from the S up St Mary River bears investigation. Climbs on the E side of the massif have been made from the great E cirque at the head of the SE terminal fork of Fry Creek. The best approach appears to be from the end of the road on Dewar Creek and over the 7200&#8242; pass immediately NW of that stream&#8217;s acute bend to the E; about 10 mi of fearsome BC bush.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Maps:<\/strong> 82F\/15 Kaslo, 82K\/2 Lardeau<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em><strong>WALL TOWER<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0 \u00a02941m\u00a0 \u00a09650&#8242;\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>Northernmost of the group.<\/em><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">From camp in the NW cirque of the group, ascend snow and\/or talus slopes to the couloir between objective and Block Tower to S, taking it to the col between them (3\u00be hr).
