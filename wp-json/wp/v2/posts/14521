In addition, three enormous images of\u00a0Nandi Bull\u00a0are found half-buried in the ground. There are various other stone as well as rock-cut images at Unakoti.<br \/>\nAccording to Hindu mythology, Lord Shiva once spent a night here en route to Kashi.\u00a0 99,99,999 gods and goddesses followed him.\u00a0He had asked his followers to wake up before sunrise and make their way towards Kashi.\u00a0Unfortunately, none awoke, except Lord Shiva himself.\u00a0Before he set out for Kashi alone, he put a curse on the others, turning them to stone.\u00a0 And that is how the site got its name.\u00a0 However, there are not that many sculptures found now. The place is peaceful &amp; surrounded by lush greenery.<br \/>\nA big fair\u00a0Ashokastami Mela\u00a0is held in April.<br \/>\nUnakoti lies 178\u00a0km to the northeast of Agartala, the closest airport, 8\u00a0km to the east from\u00a0Kailashahar, 148\u00a0km to the south-east from\u00a0Silchar.
