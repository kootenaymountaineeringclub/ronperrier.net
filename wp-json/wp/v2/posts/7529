Park your bicycle.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When one passes through Lemon Pass, Kokanee Pass, Coffee Pass or Enterprise Pass t the centre of Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park, one enters the drainage of Keen Creek. It then flows north-northeast to the Kaslo River and then to the north arm of Kootenay Lake.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Trail:<\/strong> From the BC Parks kiosk, go 40m to a signed fork. Right goes to Helen Deane Lake and Slocan Chief Cabin. Bear left for Joker Lakes Trail. Climb steadily, surrounded by an ever-increasing panorama of the Sawtooth Range on your left and Kokanee Glacier on your right.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When you reach the main Joker Creek valley, the trail flattens out before 13 steep switchbacks. Hike down to the creek for a drink and a view of the impressive Bridal Veil Cascade as it roars down the mountainside. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Joker Lakes are an odd quirk of nature. although separated by only metres, the two lakes are completely different in colour. The lower lake is milky turquoise, typical of lakes in the Rockies, the colour being due to a flow of glacial silt from the glacier, whereas the upper lake is a clear deep emerald colour. A campsite is between the two. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Fish the deep emerald lake with trout. Any discarded fish remains should ideally be disposed of in the deeper waters of the high-country lakes where they are caught. Out of sight, they are also &#8220;out of scent&#8221; of bears, and become recyclable nutrients for the relatively impoverished aquatic ecosystems. Because of the water&#8217;s coldness, they will not deteriorate quickly, so it is important that they be placed beyond the shallow water where they might be visible for some time. (This method of disposal is only valid in naturally sustaining lakes; it does not apply to heavily stocked and fished lakes where a large quantity of remains could overload the system).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>What to do?<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A short distance up the hill from the upper lake you will come to the derelict <em>Mansfield Mine cabin<\/em>. Although in an advanced state of decay, the cabin is still useful as a refuge from sudden storms.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Coffee Pass<\/strong> (2316m 7600&#8242;), above the lakes to the SE, is easily accessible and offers a superb view of Kokanee Glacier and the Coffee Creek watershed drainage to the east. Binoculars help to find mountain goats on the cliffs above.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Kane Peak<\/strong> is a great mountain to climb. It has a register. Refer to the post.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There are some unusual <em>traverses<\/em> from here 1. To Slocan Chief Cabin 2.
