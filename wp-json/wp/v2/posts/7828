Originally this was one of the old roads that provided access to the area west of Grassy Mt prior to the building of the Castelgar-Salmo Hwy. It was probably used for both mining and logging. Rumour has it that a Doukhobour settlement existed somewhere in the area where the road crossed Little McPhee Cr.
