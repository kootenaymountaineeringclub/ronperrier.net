Today, we\u2019re talking about rats: why you should love them, and why you should consider obtaining one for yourself.<\/p>\n<p><b>Man\u2019s Other Best Friend<br \/>\n<\/b>In 2022, in this newsletter, I wrote about the winter activity I hate most:\u00a0skiing. Today, in an effort to inject more kindness and positivity into the world, I am writing about a creature I love more than almost any other: the rat.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">When I say\u00a0<i>rat<\/i>, I mean every kind of rat, including the big scraggly fellows that tiptoe around your yard at night, eating trash and getting into mischief. A rat sighting, for many people, prompts disgust.\u00a0<i>That naked tail!\u00a0<\/i>they scream.\u00a0<i>Those yellow teeth!<\/i>\u00a0But the humble rat does not deserve your scorn. For she has only ever been adorable and intelligent, skittering politely through the dark alleys of human civilization\u2014a civilization that\u00a0<i>she<\/i>\u00a0helped build by testing our medicines, solving our puzzles, and detecting our land mines.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">My love for rats, in other words, has no bounds. But my persuasive efforts here are focused on the\u00a0<i>Rattus norvegicus domestica<\/i>, otherwise known as the fancy<i>\u00a0<\/i>rat, which is the kind of rat you\u2019d have as a pet. Don\u2019t let the name fool you: The fancy rat is not fancy at all. Instead, she is a down-to-earth and relatively low-maintenance creature, tidy and respectful. Fancy rats can be light brown or spotted or even blue-gray. Some, like the Dumbo rat, are white, with big floppy ears. Others are totally hairless.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The truth is that, in terms of pet quality, a rat is second only to a dog. Guinea pigs? Too messy. Ferrets? Stinky, unhinged. Don\u2019t even get me\u00a0<i>started<\/i>\u00a0on hamsters. My cousin\u2019s hamster, Snickers, once latched his razor teeth onto my thumb before sprinting off into the dark expanse of a walk-in closet, never to be seen again. A rat would\u00a0<i>never<\/i>\u00a0do this. A rat is man\u2019s other best friend: She is loyal and true, she rarely bites, and she comes when called. A rat snuggles, and enjoys scratches behind the ears. She is eager to please and to take part in your adventures.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Rats are famous for their intelligence, of course, but also for their joy. Scientists have\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.science.org\/content\/article\/tickled-rats-reveal-brain-structure-controls-laughter\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">discovered<\/a>\u00a0that rats laugh when they\u2019re tickled\u2014a sound so high-pitched and ethereal that mere humans cannot even hear it. Rats are incredibly social creatures; they like to pile together in hammocks, wrestle, and play. Studies have demonstrated that they even\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nih.gov\/news-events\/nih-research-matters\/rats-show-empathy-too\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">show empathy and concern<\/a>\u00a0for their rat compatriots.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">One of the common misconceptions about rats is that they\u2019re dirty and riddled with dangerous diseases. Although it\u2019s true that wild rats can carry and transmit serious illnesses, a pet rat is about as sanitary as any other domesticated animal! In fact, fancy rats are obsessed with grooming themselves and one another. They keep their fur and tail meticulously clean, and their cages don\u2019t smell, as long as you change out their bedding regularly. Plus, if you\u2019re interested, a rat can be taught, pretty quickly, to use a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Dn5EallFyS0\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">litter box<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">\u201cOver my dead body,\u201d my mother told me in 2003 when I was 10 years old and asked to get a rat. The tail repulsed her. But I wore her down. A few weeks later, Alice, a black-hooded fancy rat, came to live with us. She was $2.99 at a local pet store, more suited for snake food, the store staff had figured, than best friendship. But they were wrong. (Nowadays it\u2019s better and just as easy to adopt: Many rats in need are\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/anyratrescue.org\/adopt\/\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">available<\/a>\u00a0at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/mainelyratrescue.org\/rattieblog2\/\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">shelters<\/a>\u00a0across the country.)<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">For two years, little Alice lived in a cage in our kitchen, spending part of each day sleeping in a white plastic house with a blue roof, her tail tucked under her head. When she was awake, Alice ran on her wheel and dragged empty toilet paper rolls around. She snacked on carrot peels, sunflower seeds, and yogurt chips. Even if I stuck my fingers through the bars of her cage, she would never bite them\u2014only lick them gently with her tiny pink tongue. When she wanted attention, she\u2019d peer through the wires with her beady black eyes, squeaking softly and stretching out her tiny paws.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">I used to carry Alice in the pocket of my hooded sweatshirt, and she\u2019d snuggle into me while I watched\u00a0<i>Gilmore Girls<\/i>\u00a0reruns on summer afternoons. Sometimes she\u2019d ride around on the back of my golden retriever, who never seemed to mind. Dad built Alice a maze of PVC pipe around our kitchen, and we\u2019d watch her sprint through it every evening, popping up occasionally for treats. At bedtime, we\u2019d call out her name, and Alice would come galloping home.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">I would go on to have four more pet rats throughout my childhood, each different from the last in appearance and personality. Some were more talkative; others were shy and quiet. All were delightful in their own way. Rats don\u2019t live long\u2014maybe two or three years. But those rats filled my life with happiness. Taking care of them taught me how to be gentle and curious, and to never judge a creature by its tail.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Consider this your sign to get yourself\u2014or your child\u2014a rat.
