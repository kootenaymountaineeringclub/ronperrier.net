Driven forward by military escorts, the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery, rape, and massacre.\u00a0Most\u00a0Armenian diaspora\u00a0communities around the world came into being as a direct result of the genocide.<br \/>\nOther ethnic groups were similarly targeted for extermination in the\u00a0Assyrian genocide\u00a0and the\u00a0Greek genocide, and their treatment is considered by some historians to be part of the\u00a0same genocidal policy.<br \/>\nSpecifically the annihilation of the Armenians came to define systematic and premeditated exterminations within legal parameters and to coin the word\u00a0<i>genocide<\/i>\u00a0in 1943.\u00a0The Armenian Genocide is acknowledged to have been one of the first modern genocides,\u00a0because scholars point to the organized manner in which the killings were carried out. It is the second-most-studied case of genocide after the\u00a0Holocaust.<br \/>\nTurkey\u00a0denies that the word\u00a0<i>genocide<\/i>\u00a0is an accurate term for these crimes, but in recent years has been faced with increasing calls to recognize them as such.\u00a0As of 2019, governments and parliaments of 32 countries, including Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and the United States, have recognized the events as a genocide.<\/p>\n<p>In 2005, the\u00a0International Association of Genocide Scholars\u00a0affirmed that scholarly evidence revealed the &#8220;Young Turk government of the Ottoman Empire began a systematic genocide of its Armenian citizens\u00a0\u2013 an unarmed Christian minority population. More than a million Armenians were exterminated through direct killing, starvation, torture, and forced death marches.&#8221;\u00a0The IAGS also condemned Turkish attempts to deny the factual and moral reality of the Armenian Genocide. In 2007, the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity produced a letter\u00a0signed by 53\u00a0Nobel laureates\u00a0re-affirming the Genocide Scholars&#8217; conclusion that the 1915 killings of Armenians constituted genocide.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND<\/strong><br \/>\nThe western portion of historical Armenia, had come under Ottoman jurisdiction in 1555.\u00a0 Armenians were mainly concentrated in the eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire, although large communities were also found in the western provinces and 200,000 (20% of the population) in Constantinople.<br \/>\nThe Armenian community was allowed to rule itself under its own system of governance with fairly little interference from the Ottoman government. Most Armenians\u2014approximately 70%\u2014lived in poor and dangerous conditions in the rural countryside, with the exception of the wealthy, Constantinople-based\u00a0<i>Amira<\/i>\u00a0class, a social elite. There were almost three million Armenians living in the empire in 1878 (400,000 in Constantinople and the\u00a0Balkans, 600,000 in Asia Minor and\u00a0Cilicia, 670,000 in\u00a0Lesser Armenia\u00a0and the area near\u00a0Kayseri, and 1,300,000 in Western Armenia).<br \/>\nThe Armenians were subject to the whims of their Turkish and\u00a0Kurdish\u00a0neighbors, who would regularly overtax them, subject them to\u00a0brigandage\u00a0and kidnapping, force them to convert to Islam, and otherwise exploit them without interference from central or local authorities.\u00a0They had\u00a0the rights of the non-Muslims to property, livelihood and freedom of worship, but they were in essence treated as\u00a0second-class citizens\u00a0but were considered\u00a0&#8220;infidel&#8221; or &#8220;unbeliever&#8221;. Non-Muslims were prohibited from building new places of worship leading to non-Muslim communities being clustered around existing houses of worship.<br \/>\nTestimony against Muslims by Christians and Jews was inadmissible in courts of law wherein a Muslim could be punished, they were forbidden to carry weapons or ride atop horses and camels. Their houses could not overlook those of Muslims; and their religious practices were severely circumscribed, e.g., the ringing of church bells was strictly forbidden.<br \/>\nFrom 1640-76, the Armenians remained, by and large, passive during these years, but then\u00a0began to question their second-class status and press for better treatment from their government. There were complaints of widespread &#8220;forced land seizure\u00a0&#8230; forced conversion of women and children, arson,\u00a0protection extortion, rape, and murder&#8221;.<br \/>\nThe Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878 ended with Russia&#8217;s decisive victory but entire Armenian districts had been devastated by massacres carried out with the connivance of Ottoman authorities.<br \/>\nAfter the 1878 Berlin treaty, security conditions in the Armenian provinces went from bad to worse and abuses proliferated. In the\u00a0<span id=\"Hamidian_massacres,_1894\u20131896\" class=\"mw-headline\">Hamidian massacres of 1894\u20131896,<\/span>\u00a0between 100,000 and 300,000 Armenians were massacred.<br \/>\n<span id=\"Adana_massacre_of_1909\" class=\"mw-headline\">The Adana massacre of 1909 involved\u00a0<\/span>pogroms against Armenians by\u00a04,000 Turkish civilians and soldiers with\u00a015,000 and 30,000 people killed.<br \/>\nIn 1912, the\u00a0First Balkan War\u00a0ended with the defeat of the Ottoman Empire and the loss of 85% of its European territory. It resulted in the mass expulsion of Muslims\u00a0from the Balkans with hundreds of thousands of Muslims and\u00a0850,000 of these refugees were settled in areas where the Armenians resided. The\u00a0<i>muhacirs<\/i>\u00a0resented the status of their relatively well-off neighbors and\u00a0came to play a pivotal role in the killings of the Armenians and the\u00a0confiscation of their properties\u00a0during the genocide.<\/p>\n<p><strong>WW I.\u00a0<\/strong>On 2 November 1914, the Ottoman Empire entered the war on the side of the\u00a0Central Powers\u00a0and against the\u00a0Allies. The battles of the\u00a0Caucasus Campaign, the\u00a0Persian Campaign\u00a0and the\u00a0Gallipoli Campaign\u00a0affected several populous Armenian centers.\u00a0In November 1914 Shaykh ul-Islam proclaimed\u00a0Jihad\u00a0(Holy War) against the Christians: this was later used as a factor to provoke radical masses in the implementation of the Armenian Genocide.<br \/>\nIn February 1915,\u00a0all ethnic Armenians serving in the Ottoman forces were relieved from their posts and assigned to the unarmed\u00a0Labour battalions. Transferring Armenian conscripts from active combat to passive, unarmed logistic sections was an important precursor to the subsequent genocide. Many of these Armenian recruits were executed by local Turkish gangs.<br \/>\nOn the night of 23\u201324 April 1915, known as\u00a0Red Sunday, the\u00a0Ottoman government\u00a0rounded up and imprisoned an estimated\u00a0250 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders\u00a0of the Ottoman capital,\u00a0Constantinople and were gradually deported and assassinated.\u00a0The date 24 April is commemorated as\u00a0Genocide Remembrance Day\u00a0by Armenians around the world.<br \/>\n<strong>Deportations.<\/strong> The Armenians were marched out to the\u00a0Syrian\u00a0town of\u00a0Deir ez-Zor\u00a0and the\u00a0surrounding desert. The Ottoman government deliberately withheld the facilities and supplies that would have been necessary to sustain the life of hundreds of thousands of Armenian deportees. The roads and the\u00a0Euphrates\u00a0are strewn with corpses of exiles, and those who survive are doomed to certain death.<br \/>\n<strong>Rape<\/strong>\u00a0was an integral part of the genocide as\u00a0military commanders told their men to &#8220;do to [the women] whatever you wish&#8221;, resulting in widespread sexual abuse. Deportees were displayed naked in\u00a0Damascus\u00a0and sold as sex slaves in some areas, including\u00a0Mosul\u00a0constituting an important source of income for accompanying soldiers. Around a quarter of young women, whose appearance was &#8220;more or less pleasing&#8221;, were regularly raped by the gendarmes, and that &#8220;even more beautiful ones&#8221; were violated by 10\u201315 men.<br \/>\n<strong>Concentration camps<\/strong>. A network of 25 concentration camps on Turkey&#8217;s present-day borders with Iraq and Syria was set up\u00a0to dispose of the Armenians who had survived the deportations.\u00a0Ottoman authorities refused to provide food and water to the victims, increasing the mortality rate. Muslims were eager to obtain Armenian women. Authorities registered such marriages but did not record the deaths of the former Armenian husbands.<br \/>\nMass graves containing over 60,000 people and large numbers of mounds of corpses were filled with Armenians who died due to hunger and disease. Dysentery\u00a0swept through the camps<br \/>\nThe &#8220;Special Organization&#8221; composed of\u00a0hundreds, then thousands of prisoners freed\u00a0 were charged with escorting the convoys of Armenian deportees. The<sup id=\"cite_ref-107\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup> population of a village were taken all together and then burned, the shortest method for disposing of the women and children concentrated in the various camps. 80,000 Armenians in 90 villages across the Mu\u015f plain were burned in &#8220;stables and haylofts&#8221;.<br \/>\nDrowning. 50,000 women and children were loaded into boats and taken out to the Black Sea and Euphrates River and thrown overboard&#8221;.<br \/>\n<strong>Physicians<\/strong>\u00a0designed methods for poisoning victims and using Armenians as subjects for\u00a0lethal human experimentation &#8211; morphine overdose, toxic gas and typhoid inoculation.<br \/>\n<strong>Confiscation of Property<\/strong>. All property, including land, livestock, and homes belonging to Armenians, was to be confiscated by the authorities.\u00a0An assessment of $3.7 billion (about $53 billion today) worth of material losses owned solely by the Armenian church was confiscated.\u00a02,000 churches and 200 monasteries were destroyed. The total losses of personal property and assets of both Turkish and Russian Armenia totaled an estimated $347 billion today. By the early 1930s, all properties belonging to Armenians who were subject to deportation had been confiscated.\u00a0Since then, no restitution of property confiscated during the Armenian Genocide has taken place. The\u00a0mass confiscation of Armenian properties was an important factor in forming the economic basis of the\u00a0Turkish Republic\u00a0while endowing Turkey&#8217;s economy with\u00a0capital. It provided the opportunity for ordinary lower class Turks (i.e. peasantry, soldiers, and laborers) to rise to the ranks of the middle class.\u00a0An\u00a0\u00e9tatist\u00a0Turkish &#8220;national economy&#8221; was unthinkable without the destruction and expropriation of Armenians.<br \/>\nThe premeditated destruction of objects of Armenian cultural, religious, historical and communal heritage was yet another key purpose of both the genocide itself and the post-genocidal campaign of denial. Armenian churches and monasteries were destroyed or changed into mosques, Armenian cemeteries flattened, and, in several cities (e.g., Van), Armenian quarters were demolished.<br \/>\nAside from the deaths, Armenians lost their wealth and property without compensation.\u00a0Businesses and farms were lost, and all schools, churches, hospitals, orphanages, monasteries, and graveyards became Turkish state property.\u00a0After the end of World War I, Genocide survivors tried to return and reclaim their former homes and assets, but were driven out by the\u00a0Ankara Government.<br \/>\nIn 1914, a list of the Armenian holy sites contained 2,549 religious places &#8211; 200 monasteries and 1,600 churches. After 1923, out of 913 Armenian historical monuments left in Eastern Turkey, 464 have vanished completely, 252 are in ruins, and 197 are in need of repair (in stable conditions).<\/p>\n<p><strong>MEMORIALS.<\/strong> Over 135 memorials, spread across 25 countries, commemorate the Armenian Genocide.<br \/>\nIn 1967, a memorial was completed at\u00a0Tsitsernakaberd\u00a0above the\u00a0Hrazdan\u00a0gorge in Yerevan. The memorial contains a 44 metres (144\u00a0ft)\u00a0stele\u00a0which symbolizes the national rebirth of Armenians. Twelve slabs are positioned in a circle, representing 12\u00a0lost provinces in present-day Turkey. At the center of the circle there is an\u00a0eternal flame. Each 24 April, hundreds of thousands of people walk to the monument, which is the official memorial of the genocide, and lay flowers around the eternal flame.\u00a0The Armenian Genocide Museum-Institute, situated in Tsitsernakaberd, presents a rich collection of books and archival materials (photographs, documents, demographic tables, documentaries) about the history of the Armenian Genocide; it is also a research institute and a library. The museum holds a permanent, online and temporary exhibitions, which give a detailed and documented description of that period and of the atrocities.\u00a0Visits\u00a0to the museum are a part of the protocol of the Republic of Armenia. Many foreign dignitaries have already visited the Museum, including\u00a0Pope John Paul II,\u00a0Pope Francis, President of the Russian Federation\u00a0Vladimir Putin, Presidents of France\u00a0Jacques Chirac,\u00a0Francois Hollande\u00a0and other well-known public and political figures. <sup id=\"cite_ref-irishtimestigran_310-1\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The\u00a0Armenian Genocide\u00a0(also known as the\u00a0Armenian Holocaust)\u00a0was the systematic mass extermination and expulsion of 1.5 million ethnic\u00a0Armenians\u00a0within the\u00a0Ottoman Empire\u00a0(most of whom were citizens) by the\u00a0Ottoman government\u00a0from approximately 1914 to 1923.\u00a0The starting date is conventionally held to be 24 April 1915, the &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2019\/12\/04\/armenian-genocide\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-12292","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-uncategorized"],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p2Ncip-3cg","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/12292","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=12292"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/12292\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":12294,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/12292\/revisions\/12294"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=12292"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=12292"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=12292"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
