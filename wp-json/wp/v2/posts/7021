Climb the crack to a small roof, and bypass it on the left by a crack system going up and right toward the arete (fixed piton near top of crack; stance, bolt beyond).

Twenty 3\/8-inch stainless steel bolts with hangers were used on the 250-meter climb. Use Camalots to #3, a set of nuts, and small gear (very useful).

Gimli area of Valhalla Provincial Park. The guidebook (The Columbia Mountains of Canada, West &amp; South) rates the East Ridge as class 2 and calls it a \u201cvery easy walk\u201d. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">We have become so skeptical of the guidebook ratings, that we head off under sunny skies for this easy walk with a 60 m rope and full mountaineering rack. We make our way to the Nott-East Wolf\u2019s Ears col (easy meadow, talus, slabs, and snow), and start scrambling the East Ridge. After a short distance, there is a 40 m vertical gendarme on the ridge that blocks the way. On the north side is steep, icy, and very exposed snow that would take you past the gendarme, but it is unclear how you would manage to regain the East Ridge again. We elect, instead, to pass the obstruction on the south (left). Out comes the rope and I head off up an easy ledge to the base of a vertical chimney. The chimney is made much more difficult by a thin fin of rock that splits the chimney into two narrow, parallel chimneys. I flail about trying to climb outside the chimney but give up and drop my pack so I can climb inside the left half of the chimney. Once I\u2019m in, it goes fairly easily (4th class or 5.0 maybe), but is a few grades harder for Sandra who must climb outside the chimney as she is stuck carrying a big pack. The chimney is followed by class 4 grassy ledges and then a class 4 chimney (loose rock) that terminates on the East Ridge just above the top of the aforementioned gendarme \u2013 a full 60 m lead. Fresh rappel slings here suggest others have found this \u201cvery easy walk\u201d to be underrated. The rope is put away again, and the rest of the ridge is very pleasant class 3 scrambling on sound rock. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">As the weather is perfect, the views of Mulvey Basin are extraordinary. A very fine day out in the mountains. Be warned, however, that this is not a class 2 easy walk. Either the guidebook authors made a serious error compiling the route information for this mountain, or this is easily the worst sandbag I have ever experienced. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Doug Brown<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>THE MUZZLE The Muzzle is located west of the West Wolf\u2019s Ear.
