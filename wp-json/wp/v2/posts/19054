For instance, the oldest confirmed dog fossil, known as the Bonn-Oberkassel dog, is believed to be a little over 14,000 years old. The dog\u2019s remains, along with those of a man and a woman, were found in 1914 in an ancient grave in Oberkassel, Germany.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Bonn-Oberkassel dog was, in fact, a puppy, about seven months old. A recent examination of this fossil concluded that the dog suffered from distemper, and that humans provided care and nursed it through bouts of illness before it died.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">This fossil is also the oldest confirmed evidence of a domestic dog burial with humans. Whether buried alone, with other dogs, or with humans, dog burials indicate a closeness between dogs and humans that goes beyond keeping an animal for its functional uses. It signifies a high level of regard and hints at the dog\u2019s eventual transition from wild animal to pampered pet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In the 1970s, the skeletal remains of three domestic dogs were unearthed at an archaeological site called Koster, in the Illinois River Valley near the Illinois\u2013 Missouri border. The bones were discovered in shallow pits, suggesting they were buried deliberately. Because no tool marks were found on the bones (which would indicate they were killed by humans), the dogs are believed to have died from natural causes. Subsequent radiocarbon dating revealed the Koster dog bones were 10,000 years old.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Beating these out for the title of oldest domestic dog fossil in North America is a 10,150-year-old bone fragment found in Alaska. Though the bone was initially thought to be from an ancient bear, DNA proved it was from a domestic dog. Further analysis of this fossil revealed it to be closely related to a canine ancestor that lived in Siberia 23,000 years ago. All this suggests that Siberian hunters from the Ice Age may have domesticated dogs, and that humans\u2014and their canine companions\u2014migrated to North America from Siberia some 4,000 years earlier than previously believed, before the glaciers melted. By tracing how dogs moved, we understand more how humans moved.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Looking even further back, researchers analyzed previously sequenced mitochondrial dog genomes and found that all ancient American dogs may have origins traced back to a common canine ancestor that lived in Siberia about 23,000 years ago. Ancient dogs living in North America all but vanished after a few thousand years; this was likely due to the Europeans arriving to the Americas with their own breeds, which quickly took over.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq \"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Where did dogs come from?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Various studies have focused on three main geographic regions\u2014Asia, the Middle East, and Europe\u2014as places of origin for domesticated dogs.

Ancient doglike fossils found in Belgium and Siberia, as well the Czech Republic\u2014all estimated between 36,000 and 33,000 years old\u2014could imply more than one instance of attempted domestication of wolves, in multiple geographic locations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"NYwzQ vUYNV glxIO ilAoG HPkGR \">\n<div class=\"natgeo-ad\" data-testid=\"prism-ad-wrapper\" data-ad-placeholder=\"true\">\n<div data-box-type=\"fitt-adbox-fitt-article-inline-outstream\" data-testid=\"prism-ad\">\n<div id=\"ad-slot-fitt-article-inline-outstream-762691\" class=\"Ad fitt-article-inline-outstream  ad-slot  \" data-slot-type=\"fitt-article-inline-outstream\" data-slot-kvps=\"pos=fitt-article-inline-outstream-2\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">A few DNA-based studies have also suggested dual lineage, including a large 2022 study that analyzed ancient wolf DNA and found evidence that two domestication events may have taken place in East Asia and the Middle East. Other research, including two studies published in 2021, has shown evidence of one place of origin for the domesticated dog, one that traced dog origins back to Siberia 23,000 years ago, and one that identified the extinct Japanese wolf as the subspecies most closely related to domestic dogs, suggesting that the ancestor of domestic dogs may have lived in East Asia.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"FITT_Article_main_group_wrapper VZTD UeCOM jIRH oimqG DjbQm UwdmX Xmrlz ReShI KaJdY lqtkC ssImf HfYhe RTHNs iJVrZ \" data-testid=\"prism-GridContainer\">\n<div class=\"Kiog kNVGM nvpSA qwdi bmjsw \" data-testid=\"prism-GridRow\">\n<div class=\"theme-e oBTii mrzah \" data-testid=\"prism-GridColumn\">\n<div class=\"oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX \">\n<div>\n<div class=\"InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW \" data-testid=\"prism-inline-image\">\n<figure class=\"kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO \" data-testid=\"prism-figure\">\n<div class=\"lZur \" data-testid=\"prism-copyright-wrapper\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><picture data-testid=\"prism-picture\"><source srcset=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/4073f6e5-67d7-4e50-8669-f0c510fb35ba\/14_img008-2.jpg?w=374&amp;h=252, https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/4073f6e5-67d7-4e50-8669-f0c510fb35ba\/14_img008-2.jpg?w=748&amp;h=504 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 374px)\" \/><source srcset=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/4073f6e5-67d7-4e50-8669-f0c510fb35ba\/14_img008-2.jpg?w=413&amp;h=279, https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/4073f6e5-67d7-4e50-8669-f0c510fb35ba\/14_img008-2.jpg?w=826&amp;h=558 2x\" media=\"(min-width: 375px) and (max-width: 413px)\" \/><source srcset=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/4073f6e5-67d7-4e50-8669-f0c510fb35ba\/14_img008-2.jpg?w=718&amp;h=485, https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/4073f6e5-67d7-4e50-8669-f0c510fb35ba\/14_img008-2.jpg?w=1436&amp;h=970 2x\" media=\"(min-width: 414px)\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"hsDdd vBqtr KrDt itslR zFTjo hakZw HlUVI UbGlr \" draggable=\"false\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/4073f6e5-67d7-4e50-8669-f0c510fb35ba\/14_img008-2.jpg\" alt=\"Fossil bones of a dog are seen partly covered in mud.

Because dogs and gray wolves share 99.9 percent of their DNA, researchers can analyze genetic variations. However, DNA analysis is not always clear-cut, making it hard to reach definitive conclusions. It\u2019s also tough to use observable traits (such as body size, hair length and color, head and leg shape) within individuals of a species\u2014characteristics called phenotypes\u2014to compare today\u2019s dogs with their ancestors, a still unknown subspecies of the gray wolf.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Though fossil evidence points to dog domestication happening around 14,000 years ago, DNA-based research often puts the split between wolves and dogs much earlier. The 2022 DNA study, which analyzed 72 ancient wolf genomes spanning 100,000 years, concluded that dogs likely appeared as long ago as 40,000 years, which roughly lines up with time frames some earlier studies pinpointed. In 2017, for example, researchers analyzed genomes from three ancient dog fossils from Germany and Ireland. After comparing those ancient genomes with genetic data from more than 5,000 modern dogs and wolves, the team estimated that dogs and wolves parted ways between 37,000 and 41,000 years ago. That study also determined that dogs split into two populations between 17,000 and 24,000 years ago: eastern (the progenitors of East Asian breeds) and western (which would go on to become modern European, South Asian, Central Asian, and African breeds). Based on these time frames, they estimate dog domestication occurring sometime between 20,000 to 40,000 years ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Science and technology continue to provide new and improved resources for researchers to employ in their search for answers.

It was 2020, the height of the pandemic, and her house felt empty. Maisie was a nine-week-old bundle of cream-colored fur and lopsided ears. But Munt, a consultant in Sacramento, soon became convinced that the dog was not normal. Maisie howled at any stimulus. She paced all night and pounced on anyone who came to the house. Munt, who had only ever owned cats, couldn\u2019t understand why anyone would choose to have a dog. \u201cI had been the best dog mother I could be,\u201d she told me. But she spent much of that first year in tears.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Maisie\u2019s vet prescribed fluoxetine, better known as Prozac, but it ruined the dog\u2019s appetite. Munt then turned to Melissa Bain, a veterinary behaviorist with a wider pharmaceutical arsenal. Maisie now takes venlafaxine, an antidepressant, and gabapentin, an anticonvulsant, with an option for the sedative clonidine in particularly fraught situations. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a cocktail that is always being adjusted,\u201d Munt said. She spends hundreds of dollars each month on Maisie\u2019s care and considers it well worth it. Perhaps the most valuable treatment Bain offered, however, was for the human, not the dog. \u201cHonestly, it just felt cathartic in many ways,\u201d Munt told me. \u201cShe said, \u2018It\u2019s Maisie. It\u2019s not you. You have done everything you need to do.\u2019\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The rise in anxiety among American humans has been exhaustively documented. With much less fanfare, we also seem to have entered the age of the anxious canine. Last fall, a\u00a0New York Times\u00a0wellness column\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/11\/10\/well\/pet-anxiety-meds.html\">offered<\/a>\u00a0earnest advice on \u201cHow to Handle Your Pet\u2019s Anxiety\u201d; the author, reporting that veterinarians were observing an uptick in stressed-out animals, noted that two of her editors had cats on Prozac. In a 2016\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4838767\/\">study<\/a>, 83 percent of veterinary general practitioners reported prescribing dogs anti-anxiety medication. (In the 1990s, some began prescribing Prozac off-label; the FDA\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4838767\/\">approved<\/a>\u00a0a version for treating dog separation anxiety in 2007.) Although there are no comprehensive statistics on the share of dogs on prescription anxiety meds, more than half of American dog owners said that they buy \u201ccalming\u201d products including pheromone spray and Lycra jumpsuits, according to the American Pet Products Association\u2019s 2023\u201324 pet-owners survey. Google searches for\u00a0dog anxiety\u00a0have roughly tripled over the past decade. Many of America\u2019s 85 veterinary behaviorists are booked months in advance. The seven I spoke with said that the number of people seeking pet mental-health care has exploded in the past few years. But there is no consensus as to why.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">One theory is that dogs today really are more anxious. Rather than buying from a breeder, more Americans are choosing to adopt. According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, shelters are euthanizing nearly two-thirds\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.aspca.org\/helping-people-pets\/shelter-intake-and-surrender\/pet-statistics\">fewer<\/a>\u00a0animals than they were a decade ago. Adoption saves lives, but it sometimes leaves traumatized pets with inexperienced owners. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve also altered the way pets live. Pet dogs (and cats) used to spend more time outside; now, experts told me, they\u2019re much more likely to stay indoors. When they do go outside, they\u2019re kept on leashes or under supervision. As Americans have fewer kids, they\u2019ve begun to think of their pets as children and to act as \u201chelicopter\u201d fur-parents, the bioethicist Jessica Pierce told me. Animals tend to live longer under these conditions, but they miss out on mental stimulation and interaction with their own species. That might make them anxious or aggressive toward people and other dogs. The pandemic dog-buying spike\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/home-alone-the-fate-of-postpandemic-dogs\/\">heightened<\/a>\u00a0all of these dynamics, as millions of dogs spent their first years socially distancing.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Still, the proliferation of medicated dogs might say more about their owners. Vet behaviorists are mostly clustered in liberal areas; so are\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/magazine.columbia.edu\/article\/why-depression-rates-are-higher-among-liberals\">human<\/a>\u00a0anxiety diagnoses. Amy Pike started her career practicing in rural Kentucky, where her client list was short. Now she serves pet owners in D.C., Maryland, and Virginia, and business is booming. In Pike\u2019s view, that\u2019s because her new neighbors have a healthy respect for the science around pet mental health and medication. She and other vet behaviorists believe that dogs have always been anxious, and that the welcome destigmatization of human mental-health issues has allowed us to finally recognize their suffering. But it could be that anxious adults are projecting their own issues onto their furry companions. Some dog owners have clearly begun to pathologize normal dog habits. A\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S1558787818302727\">2019 survey<\/a>\u00a0concluded that 85 percent of dogs had behavioral problems; almost half of the owners reported that their pet had anxiety. The numbers seem incredible, until you look at the list of bad behaviors. Repetitive behaviors like digging in the yard or displaying a \u201ctennis ball fetish\u201d qualified, as did excessive barking. What people classify as a behavioral issue, said Pierce, the bioethicist, reflects human expectations as much as a dog\u2019s nature.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">So is the dog-anxiety crisis real, or is it a product of owners\u2019 anxiety-riddled psyches? Dogs can\u2019t tell us how they\u2019re feeling, so we\u2019ll probably never know. But both explanations are depressing. Either humans are stressing dogs out so much that they truly need prescription meds, or owners are putting their dogs on unnecessary psychoactive drugs to address annoying but normal dog habits. It might be time, in other words, to reevaluate the way we approach dog ownership. Many Americans don\u2019t have the time, energy, or green space their pets need to thrive. If the choice is to medicate our dogs or to make them, and ourselves, miserable, pet ownership starts to seem ethically murky. \u201cIdeally, a lot fewer people would own dogs and cats,\u201d Pierce told me.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">That\u2019s a hard message for pet lovers to hear. When I was growing up, my family had a labradoodle named Trixie. For much of her life, she was a dog-park dog, happiest when chasing tennis balls and sniffing puppy butts. But about halfway through her 15 years, she was bitten by another dog. After the incident, Trixie snarled and snapped at other dogs she met. We spent less time at the park.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">My conversations with pet behaviorists made me wonder if I had failed her. It hadn\u2019t occurred to me to slather Xanax in peanut butter and slip it into her kibble. Had I missed the signs that my dog needed treatment? I asked Bain, the veterinary behaviorist, about this. I could sense that she thought the answer was yes. But she was gentle about it. \u201cWere you a bad owner when your dog barked at other dogs?\u201d she asked. I began fumbling out a response, but she interrupted me. \u201cNo. No. No. You weren\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know any better.\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It was kind of her to reassure me. But I was still left to wonder whether medicating dogs is in their best interest\u2014or ours.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">==============================================================<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>I DON\u2019T LIKE DOGS<br \/>\n<\/strong>I joined a Subreddit that shares my extremely unpopular opinion.

Recently, however, I learned about a community of people just like me: The\u00a0Dogfree Subreddit. I don\u2019t use Reddit much, but immediately, I was taken by r\/Dogfree\u2019s tagline: \u201cWe don\u2019t like dogs.\u201d I had never before seen this, my most taboo opinion, written out so plainly.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">That first day on the site, I couldn\u2019t stop reading posts, which are mostly news reports of dog bites, complaints about seeing dogs in public, and gripes about\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/family\/archive\/2023\/07\/new-york-picking-up-dog-poop\/674825\/\">sidewalk poop<\/a>, barking, and other dog-related externalities.\u00a0One post\u00a0is titled, \u201cThe fact they breathe with their mouths open and tongues hanging is enough for me to want nothing to do with them.\u201d As I read my same unpopular views, reflected back by other people, I was overcome by the thrill of being truly known, by the unmistakable gasp of catharsis.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Subreddit\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Dogfree\/comments\/bnuc4n\/welcome_to_our_community_please_read_our_faqs\/\">FAQ<\/a>\u00a0includes a response to a frequent assumption that, surely, our problem is with unruly dogs and their oblivious owners. \u201cThough it might be a tough pill to swallow,\u201d the moderators respond, \u201cwe in this sub simply\u00a0don\u2019t like dogs.\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A few bad experiences crystallized my lifelong disdain. On top of not liking dogs, I\u2019m allergic to them. When I was 9, I had to be picked up from a friend\u2019s slumber party after her dachshund crawled across my pillow and my eyes swelled shut. I still remember the indignity of having to call my parents, the thick stupor brought on by extra-strength Benadryl, the painful wheezing as I ran my face under the tap at 2 a.m. It was my introduction to the fact that it\u2019s a dog\u2019s world and I\u2019m just living in it.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Other times, I\u2019ve had scary run-ins with dogs that were trying to \u201cprotect\u201d their owners. In grad school, my boyfriend\u2019s roommate had a pit bull that would terrorize me whenever I went over while the roommate stood back and laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s friendly!\u201d he\u2019d say dismissively. (The Dogfree people hate when dog owners say this.) When we first moved into our house, our neighbor\u2019s enormous dog, apparently confusing us for intruders, bounded into our yard and ran straight at me, barking wildly. I screamed an expletive. The neighbor did nothing. This is probably why I never bothered to meet those neighbors.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">None of these encounters, of course, were particularly dangerous. But they cemented an impression that dogs are at best gross, and at worst threatening. More recently, I was with a group of people that included a pediatric reconstructive plastic surgeon. She told us about her job mending the faces of kids who have been in horrible accidents, and someone asked her, \u201cSeeing what you see in your profession, what\u2019s one thing you would never do?\u201d \u201cGet a pit bull,\u201d she said quietly.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But this kind of thing just doesn\u2019t trouble most people. The majority of Americans\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/short-reads\/2023\/07\/07\/about-half-us-of-pet-owners-say-their-pets-are-as-much-a-part-of-their-family-as-a-human-member\/\">own a pet<\/a>, and dogs are the most popular pet choice. Americans are\u00a0more attached\u00a0to their dogs than they are to their cats or other animals: Most dog owners say the dog is as much a part of their family as a human family member. If forced to choose,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/today.yougov.com\/topics\/society\/articles-reports\/2023\/07\/10\/pets-morality-americans-attached-dogs-cats-poll\">39 percent of Americans<\/a>\u00a0would rather save their closest pet from death than one human person. I may not understand this bond, but I know I can\u2019t argue with it. All of this leads to a lot of pent-up anti-dog sentiment, which I was happy to off-gas on r\/Dogfree.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">At last, a place to discuss the revulsion of seeing a \u201cdog blanketd\u201d on someone\u2019s couch, which you\u2019re expected to sit on even though it\u2019s covered in hair and god knows what else.

Or the extreme strangeness of the fact that owning a dog requires you,\u00a0the human, to scoop the poop of them,\u00a0the animal, into little bags, which many humans then leave\u00a0scattered around\u00a0everywhere.

A lot of them, though, just simply have never liked dogs. Most aren\u2019t allergic, but most are afraid of at least certain kinds of dogs. And it\u2019s not an anti-animal\u00a0Subreddit: Less than a quarter are totally pet-free and plan to remain that way; lots of members express a desire to care for a cat.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">GemstoneWriter, a 19-year-old thinks dogs are loud and dirty, but she tries to think of dog owners as \u201clost, rather than enemies&#8221;. She doesn\u2019t like how some people elevate dogs to nearly the status of human children. Still, she doesn\u2019t admit to many people that she dislikes dogs, and Dogfree makes her feel less alone. When someone\u2019s attacked by a dog, she likes how people in the Subreddit empathize with the victim instead of defending the dog or owner.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Emma Allum, a 41-year-old member in Southeast England, gets unnerved when big dogs veer toward her or stare at her. \u201cI don\u2019t like it when they lick me,\u201d she told me, \u201cand when you\u2019re just walking along, minding your own business, and some big dog shouts in your ear from behind the garden fence.\u201d During our Zoom call, it felt uncanny to hear this thought coming from someone else. When a dog licks me, all I can think about is how soon I can take a shower.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Allum\u2019s fear of dogs sharpened over a series of jarring incidents, such as when one dog tried to sniff her baby son while he sat in his stroller and when another charged at her in a field. But dogs are popular in her area, so if you\u2019re afraid of dogs, \u201cyou are made to feel like a bit of a plonker,\u201d she said. Not so on the Subreddit. There are no plonkers there.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Subreddit is an example of a \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2006\/12\/10\/magazine\/10Section2b.t-7.html\">negativity friendship<\/a>\u201d\u2014a community of people united by something they don\u2019t like. (In politics, negative partisanship is a similar phenomenon.)\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Jennifer-Bosson\/publication\/227674233_Interpersonal_chemistry_through_negativity_Bonding_by_sharing_negative_attitudes_about_others\/links\/5a0d92ed0f7e9b9e33ab5337\/Interpersonal-chemistry-through-negativity-Bonding-by-sharing-negative-attitudes-about-others.pdf\">Several studies<\/a>\u2014which remarkably did not involve me as a participant\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Jennifer-Bosson\/publication\/227674233_Interpersonal_chemistry_through_negativity_Bonding_by_sharing_negative_attitudes_about_others\/links\/5a0d92ed0f7e9b9e33ab5337\/Interpersonal-chemistry-through-negativity-Bonding-by-sharing-negative-attitudes-about-others.pdf\">have found<\/a>\u00a0that hating the same person brings people closer together than liking the same person does. We seem to appreciate the risk the other person took in revealing something so unsavory; if we share the unsavory view, all the better. In a world where pretty much everyone likes travel and hiking and coffee, your tribe comprises those who hate what you hate. \u201cBecause of the potential social repercussions and relative rarity of revealing negative attitudes, perceivers view negative attitudes as especially informative,\u201d one such\u00a0study finds.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In fact, the more I perused r\/Dogfree, the more I found I disliked dogs\u2014and the less I could see any other point of view. The forum kept reminding me of new ways dogs are disgusting. I\u2019m not normally paranoid about dog bites, but Dogfree makes maulings seem widespread. Dog owners aren\u2019t allowed to post in the Subreddit, so we never get a sense of, say, how owners would prefer to be told that we don\u2019t want to pet their dog. Though I\u2019m sure no dog lovers will be friends with me after this story anyway, it seems like simultaneously staying active in the Subreddit and remaining close with a doting dog parent would be difficult. At one point, I was apparently reading so much anti-dog propaganda that my phone\u2019s hidden algorithms took note and TikTok served me a video about a woman whose top lip was ripped off by a pit bull.\u00a0We know what you like, it seemed to say.\u00a0You like to hate on dogs.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">After a while, I started to question whether this was actually healthy. Some of the posts on the Subreddit seemed like they were stoking fear and rage rather than offering support. Is it really that bad to see a\u00a0dog with its head sticking\u00a0out of a car? Do dogs really\u00a0not belong in nature? Is it truly that annoying when a dog\u00a0looks at you?<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Subreddit is also an example of an echo chamber, but whether echo chambers are harmful, per se, is unclear. From studies of partisan political news, researchers have concluded that not only are very few people actually members of echo chambers; seeing mostly one-sided news doesn\u2019t appear to radicalize people as much as we may fear. In studies of people who spent months consuming partisan news, \u201cpeople\u2019s views did not become more extreme and people did not become more hostile toward the other side,\u201d Magdalena Wojcieszak, a professor at UC Davis who has studied online polarization, told me.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The moderators of the Subreddit didn\u2019t respond to my requests for an interview, but\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Dogfree\/comments\/vcjw43\/media_inquiries_please_decline_comment\/\">in a post<\/a>\u00a0in which they urged members not to talk with reporters, they essentially agreed with this analysis: \u201cWe\u2019re accused on an almost-daily basis of being an \u2018echo chamber,\u2019 but we don\u2019t find that to be an inaccurate or even unfavorable perception of us; perhaps it\u2019s an echo chamber, but it\u2019s the only one we have.\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Nevertheless, I started to feel like this whole thing might be a giant yucking of a yum, a slam book we were compiling on the rest of the school. The Subreddit doesn\u2019t allow posts about animal abuse, but I was a little taken aback by the attitude of one user, who chatted me: \u201cI fuckin hate dogs, wish they\u2019d die out as a species, and my dream job would be head euthanizer at the pound.\u201d Yeesh.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I wouldn\u2019t want to own a dog myself, but I generally believe that people have a right to do what makes them happy, as long as it doesn\u2019t affect anyone else. The dog owners who can manage that should be left in peace! I occasionally felt bad participating in the disparagement of animals that didn\u2019t get a say in whether they became pets, are only obeying their natural instincts, and, after all, can\u2019t even read.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Allum told me that although, on the whole, she finds the Subreddit validating, she\u2019s careful not to get too sucked in. She skips some of the articles about dog bites, figuring they won\u2019t do anything to help with her fear. Lots of people on the Subreddit hate dogs, but Allum doesn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah, okay, this person has said this, but I don\u2019t actually hate dogs,\u2019\u201d she told me.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">This is the problem we all face online: the tricky balance of joining in without losing ourselves. It\u2019s being religious without becoming a zealot, sharing without one-upping, not letting your stated beliefs outrun your actual opinions. Life inside the echo chamber is cozy, but also cacophonous.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I still think I will visit Dogfree occasionally, and I still think it\u2019s a good place for people to talk about their fear of dogs\u2014a stigmatized and poorly understood phobia. I still wish I didn\u2019t have to interact with dogs as often as I do.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But I will probably find a wider group of Subreddits to follow. After all, the site offers plenty of options. For example, I don\u2019t\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/catfree\/\">like cats<\/a>, either.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">============================================================<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>WHY SO MANY MILLENNIALS ARE OBSESSED WITH DOGS.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The only thing getting me through my 30s is a cranky, agoraphobic Chihuahua named Midge.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">By\u00a0Amanda Mull<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Since the beginning\u00a0of the coronavirus pandemic, I have asked one question more than any other. It\u2019s come up time and again, day and night, as frequently in my post-vaccination spring and summer as it did in the dark moments of the pandemic\u2019s first wave: Are you my booboo?<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The question is never answered by Midge, my agoraphobic Chihuahua, but the answer is obvious. She\u2019s been my booboo since 2018, when I brought her home from a cat shelter, where she had been stashed by a Long Island dog rescue after her foster family gave her back\u2014she didn\u2019t like them, or anyone, and cats aren\u2019t looking for new friends. At 12 pounds, she is twice as big as the most desirable Chihuahuas, and she has a moderately bad personality, which is maybe why the puppy mill where she spent the first year of her life decided it didn\u2019t want any more of her robust and extremely rude babies. Now almost five years old, she has grown to tolerate me. I ask her questions she doesn\u2019t answer\u2014if she\u2019s my booboo (yes), if she\u2019s a big girl (relatively speaking), if she has a kibble tummy (a little bit).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Since last March, Midge and I have been testing the bounds of what it means to live in my very small apartment together. In many ways, she\u2019s been a perfect pandemic pal: She hates interacting with others; she loves to sit on the couch; she long ago assessed sneezes as an existential threat. Whether she was sitting on a blanket in the kitchen while I cooked, frowning at me from a safe distance while I did yoga, or watching me do chores from beneath the leaves of her favorite enormous tropical houseplant, she bore witness to a year I spent otherwise alone. Every day, she climbed up the back of the couch to snooze atop its rear cushions, her face pointed toward mine at eye level while I worked at the kitchen table.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In a year when time felt slippery, Midge kept track of it\u2014waking me up for breakfast, waging a nightly campaign for dinner, huffing and snorting and pacing until I got up from work to play fetch with her stuffed crocodile for a few minutes. Many days, she was the only living thing I spoke to, and the only one I touched. She tolerated most of my hugs, and once, when I was in the depths of late-winter depression, she let me pick her up and hold her tiny, warm chest to my forehead for a few seconds. Her big brown eyes look dismayed and embarrassed after these displays of affection, which is usually enough to make me laugh. I tell her she\u2019s a good girl and try not to think about how much worse the past year would have been without her.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Or, for that matter, the past three years. The 2020\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/family\/archive\/2020\/04\/pandemic-puppy\/609829\/\">pet-adoption surge<\/a>\u00a0was sharp: Shelters emptied and rescue groups ran out of dogs as the work-from-home set welcomed new companions for themselves and their kids. Among adults under 40, who accounted for the majority of pet adoptions, the pandemic-era spike in demand was anomalous in its intensity, not its trajectory. Millennials recently overtook Boomers as the largest pet-owning cohort of Americans; by some estimates, more than half of them have a dog. The pet-ownership rate is even higher among those with a college education and a stable income\u2014the same people who are most likely to delay marriage, parenthood, and homeownership beyond the timelines set by previous generations. Dogs, long practical partners in rural life or playmates for affluent children, have become a life stage unto themselves.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">That dogs\u2019 roles are changing isn\u2019t itself so surprising. Humans and canines have been molding themselves to each other\u2019s needs for\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/06\/the-origin-of-dogs\/484976\/\">tens of thousands of years<\/a>, helping ensure the mutual survival of both species. The question is why the relationship is changing so quickly right now. For America\u2019s newest adopters, a dog can be many things: a dry run for parenthood, a way of putting down roots when traditional milestones feel out of reach, an enthusiastic housemate for people likely to spend stretches of their 20s and 30s living alone. An even more primary task, though, is helping soothe the psychic wounds of modern life.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Midge\u2019s adoption was\u00a0both planned and impulsive. In 2017, I went apartment hunting for my first place of my own in New York, looking only at buildings that allowed dogs, even though I didn\u2019t have one. Then, I waited. How do you know if you\u2019re ready to keep another mammal alive? I had no idea, but I found myself at a party in early 2018, in a professional rut and at the end of a relationship. A friend notorious for her flakiness showed up late, and when she arrived, she had in tow both her own happy mutt and another that she was watching for the weekend. A little bomb exploded in my head\u2014if she could avoid killing two dogs simultaneously, surely I could manage one. I spent the next few days perusing Petfinder.com. Midge was on my lap on the B48 bus the next weekend.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I would have denied it at the time, but I got a dog because I was frustrated with everything else. The benchmarks that I was raised to believe would make me a real, respectable adult seemed foreign, even though I was 32, the same age when my mother, already a married homeowner working for the employer she\u2019d have for the rest of her career, became pregnant with me. This particular\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2021\/05\/millennial-grandparents-unequal-generation\/618859\/\">Millennial sob story<\/a>\u00a0is familiar by now: Thanks to wealth inequality and wage stagnation and rising housing and child-care costs and student loans and all the rest, we\u2019re the first generation to do worse than our parents. People like me, who grew up middle-class, don\u2019t tend to suffer the most severe economic fallout. But the existential crisis provoked by these changes can still feel acute. All your life, you were told that if you worked to follow a particular path, you would be rewarded. Then the path was bulldozed to make room for luxury condos.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Millennials recently overtook Boomers as the largest pet-owning cohort of Americans; by some estimates, more than half of them have a dog.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When I adopted Midge, I had no clear view of a future beyond my one-bedroom apartment, let alone a future involving a family of my own, and I still don\u2019t. As I looked around for an opening through which to push my life forward, the gap that was available to me was roughly the size of a hefty Chihuahua. Dogs are, for some of us, a perfect balm for purgatorial anxieties. If you have time and care to give, they love freely, they put you on a schedule, they direct your attention and affection and idle thoughts toward something outside yourself. The desire to turn outward and spend energy nurturing others is a mark of emotional maturity, but that nurturing needs a vessel.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">People without kids adopt pets not only as a dry run for eventual children but for lots of other reasons, too, including as an outlet for caring impulses that have nothing to do with parenthood. They also lavish their dogs with privileges that, in America, have historically been reserved for other people: Dogs now sleep in the same bed as their humans at night; they have birthday parties; they go see their friends at daycare.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But for the particular rung of the American socioeconomic ladder that has pursued dog ownership most fervently in recent years\u2014young, urban professionals, especially white ones\u2014dogs serve yet another purpose: They\u2019re a class marker and a way of coping with deep status anxiety. Dogs broadcast stability\u2014Midge is not nearly as expensive as a child or a single-family home, but she is an indicator that I have mastered enough elements of my own life to introduce some joyful chaos into it.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Yet while dogs can be an effective therapy for the stresses of modern life, especially as it grows lonelier and more precarious, their friendship isn\u2019t always available to those who could use it most. For people clawing to maintain basic stability (instead of signaling that they\u2019ve attained a middle-class version of it), the barriers to dog ownership are larger than simply having the disposable income to feed another mouth. A lot of subsidized and low-income housing refuses pets or limits the type and number that residents can have, and homeless shelters generally require people to abandon their pets to get a place to sleep. Companionship, whether with a pet or other people, is elemental to human dignity; in America, it\u2019s easier to come by if you have money.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">According to\u00a0Pat Shipman, a paleoanthropologist and the author of the forthcoming book\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/bookshop.org\/a\/12476\/9780674971936\">Our Oldest Companions: The Story of the First Dogs<\/a>, humans and dogs have been living together for about 40,000 years, though for almost all that time, the relationship was primarily practical; we gave dogs food and heat from fire, and dogs helped us spot approaching danger and track prey.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As humans shared their hunting spoils, dogs had less need for their lupine ancestors\u2019 brutality, and more need, evolutionarily speaking, to appeal to people. As a result, long before we started breeding them, dogs shrank, their ears flopped, their tails curled\u2014they became cute. They also acquired eyebrow muscles that gave them a much larger range of expressions than wolves, allowing them to better communicate with humans.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/bookshop.org\/a\/12476\/9781481300209\">A Dog\u2019s History of the World: Canines and the Domestication of Humans<\/a>, Laura Hobgood shows how, along the way, dogs became vital players in humans\u2019 emotional lives. As smaller dogs suitable for in-home pest control (and companionship) emerge in prehistoric fossil records, their burial sites reflect a high level of care: Dogs weren\u2019t just useful to humans; they were beloved. Still, the concept of a pet\u2014a companion animal that plays no functional role in a household\u2014is far more recent, dating back only about 3,000 years. The first pets tended to be tiny, manicured lapdogs, and were an extravagance of the wealthy; the ancient Pekingese breed, for example, was once legally reserved for members of the Chinese imperial court. For everybody else, the human-canine bond continued to be not only emotional but practical. (Many of the breeds now slotted into the working, sporting, hound, herding, and terrier groups at dog shows were in fact developed to perform specific tasks for agrarian families.)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Industrialization was the beginning of the end of that era for most dogs. Over time, as people left rural areas for cities, more of them began departing the home every day for work or school\u2014and much of daily life suddenly took place where dogs weren\u2019t allowed to go. But if dogs were with humans less, that didn\u2019t mean that humans no longer needed their companionship\u2014in some ways, we may have needed it more. \u201cHaving pets helps people physically and psychologically,\u201d Shipman told me, rattling off research findings. Mental illness, incarceration, isolation, grief, post-traumatic stress disorder, autism\u2014virtually all modern trials can be eased, in measurable ways, by the companionship of a dog.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Seen this way, it makes perfect sense that so many isolated, stressed-out people brought dogs into their life during the pandemic. Dogs pull us out into the world, make us get some sun on our face, give us an opening to chat with our neighbors. After a year when serendipitous social interaction was hard to come by, it returned to my life in the form of Cowboy, a then-14-week-old puppy who moved into an apartment on my floor in February. While waiting for his vaccinations to be complete (same, buddy), Cowboy\u2019s owners ran him up and down the empty hall a couple of times a day to work out some of his puppy energy. That\u2019s how I met him, and after a few encounters, he would scratch at my door every day to say hi.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">At some point soon, Cowboy\u2019s dads will go back to in-person work, and so will I. Visions have danced in my head of loading Midge into a BabyBj\u00f6rn and carrying her everywhere I go, like a real asshole. Some minority of pet owners may be able to do just that, as anxious employers try to cajole people back into the office and prevent them from jumping ship with promises of pet-friendly workspaces. But many people\u2014even many dog lovers\u2014will likely balk at these reverse-engineered solutions. Contemporary offices are barely hospitable to humans, let alone a new population of four-legged co-workers.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">What if, instead of forcing dogs to fit our modern lives, we set about making modern life more hospitable to pets? Doing so would require us to acknowledge that our connection to other living things\u2014and to the natural world at large\u2014isn\u2019t a luxury, but an essential element of what makes us human. Fittingly, virtually all of the changes that would make having a pet easier would make life more humane for people too: flexible working conditions, for example, and affordable housing, and more public green space. (That the list of dog-friendly circumstances is basically identical to the things that would make it easier for more Americans to have kids isn\u2019t a coincidence. Dogs aren\u2019t children, of course, but their popularity among those of childbearing age is indicative of the deep emotional commitments that people rush toward when given the chance.)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I often look down at Midge\u2014as she weaves between my feet while I cook, or when she\u2019s sprawled in a sunny spot, tongue hanging out\u2014and marvel at the little animal that lives in my apartment.

Three pups in the litter ended up being good candidates for guide dogs, but the husband with allergies could only tolerate one. That dog, named Sultan, was trained and sent off to Hawaii. But the organization had trouble pairing the other two dogs with blind handlers; people wanted purebred Labrador retrievers, not mixed breeds. Conron asked the group\u2019s public relations department to notify the media and share that they had created a brand-new, \u201cnonallergenic\u201d guide dog called the Labradoodle. The gimmick worked and suddenly people were clamoring for this new guide dog breed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When the general public heard of Labradoodles, people wanted them as pets. Other breeders began crossbreeding Labs and poodles, golden retrievers and poodles, and as the years went on, many other breeds with poodles, making up cutesy names and fueling the \u201cdoodle\u201d craze.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq \"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Oodles of doodles<\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Today, the poodle has been crossed with nearly every breed imaginable, though the Labradoodle and golden doodle are the most popular. Other designer breeds\u2014such as the puggle (a pug crossed with a beagle) and goldador (a golden retriever crossed with a Labrador retriever)\u2014leave out the poodle and instead combine other breeds. Along with the beloved mutt, designer dog breeds are not recognized by most breed registries in North America such as the American Kennel Club, Canadian Kennel Club, or United Kennel Club. Unlike purebred dogs, designer dogs do not have officially recognized breed standards. Personal preferences among breeders means the dogs have no standardized look.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Though many people believe doodles do not trigger dog allergies and don\u2019t shed, this is often not the case, especially when the parents of a litter are a poodle and a purebred of another breed. Doodles that are 75 percent poodle and 25 percent another breed are more likely to have the poodle\u2019s hypoallergenic coat, though it\u2019s not guaranteed.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX \">\n<div class=\"LoCYw blgIc QcZAj wGwCE XfBPw McMna ubPuV pdYhu RBrva \" role=\"complementary\" data-testid=\"prism-listicle\">\n<h3 class=\"wCqmG oFFrS lqtkC \"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Hair of the Dog<\/span><\/h3>\n<div class=\"InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW LdpEt ywYSE \" data-testid=\"prism-inline-image\">\n<figure class=\"kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO \" data-testid=\"prism-figure\">\n<div class=\"lZur \" data-testid=\"prism-copyright-wrapper\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><picture data-testid=\"prism-picture\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"hsDdd vBqtr KrDt itslR zFTjo hakZw HlUVI \" draggable=\"false\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/0760c585-68a1-4503-a729-4f7ae22b0543\/SLOD_hair_graphic_1_new_full-crop.jpg\" alt=\"A graphic of 6 dogs (Irish water spaniel, bichon frise, airdale, golden retriver, bearded collie, and an Australian terrier) with a Venn diagram in the middle showing the three genes of hair and the overlap of the genes that make up each dog's hair.\" data-testid=\"prism-image\" \/><\/picture><\/span><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur \" data-testid=\"prism-caption\">\n<div class=\"qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh \"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span class=\"gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh \">Illustration by John Tomania, Dan Williams<\/span><span class=\"hwBxp BSePc mDqOy pRFoZ UoVV gFgY dSKvB spGOb \">&#8211;<\/span><span class=\"gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ daRJQ cOnLK CufRp IQNJF \">Adam Boyko, Cornell University<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ wMUi BSxhF Qcvvy Rmxn qLtV \"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Hundreds of genes interact to produce a physical trait in humans and most mammals.

No dog\u2014 whether purebred, designer, or mixed breed\u2014is guaranteed to not trigger a person with allergies, though some people suffering from allergies to dogs find they can successfully live with certain breeds that are truly hypoallergenic, such as poodles, bichons frises, and Portuguese water dogs.
