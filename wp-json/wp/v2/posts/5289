On November 25th Egypt\u2019s President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi approved a committee tasked with \u201cimproving the morals and values\u201d in his country. Efforts to reduce littering or sexual harassment, both plagues in Egypt, might be welcome. But experience in the Middle East suggests that the boot will be put into more harmless activities.<br \/>\nIn September, for example, Egypt locked up two belly-dancers for \u201cinciting debauchery\u201d after they showed a little skin in online videos; one of the dancers, known as \u201cEgypt\u2019s Shakira\u201d, is most famous for a video which features much suggestive use of a pestle and mortar, but no more flesh than is revealed by a low-cut blouse and an above-the-knee skirt. A young Egyptian couple tells of police accusing them of being together without being married, something that is not banned in the country. Across the region gay people, atheists and dissidents are punished for their supposed moral transgressions.<\/p>\n<p>Saudi Arabia and Iran, regional and religious rivals, are the bossiest. Both regimes claim to be Islamic. Both have vice squads. In Iran they berate women for showing too much fringe; in Saudi Arabia, for wearing too flirty an abaya, the big, usually black, cloak that is mandatory for females there, or being in the company of unrelated males. They enforce bans on alcohol, parties and other things that normal people, even the most morally upright, enjoy. Saudi media recently reported that female bureaucrats wearing too much make-up would be fined 1000 riyals ($266).<br \/>\nIn November Saudi Arabia sentenced Ashraf Fayadh, a poet, to death. He was accused of apostasy and of having illicit relations with women, whose images he stored in his phone. He denies the charges. He had previously posted a video showing the religious police whipping a man; his supporters think the police are taking revenge. Saudi Arabia beheads people for moral transgressions. Iran hangs them.<\/p>\n<p>Police in Algeria, Morocco and Sudan, too, have powers to stamp out immorality. Sudan\u2019s criminal code, which outlaws adultery and women wearing trousers, is particularly harsh. Vague laws across the region such as causing offence and encouraging indecency are broad and open to abuse. Violators can be flogged.<br \/>\nSince the 1970s Arab populations have grown more devout. This makes it easier for rulers to use \u201cmorality\u201d to keep them in line. Women, especially, are told how to dress and under what circumstances they may have sex. <\/p>\n<p>In Morocco and Algeria, women who are raped are sometimes made to marry their rapist.<br \/>\nSocial censure is pervasive, and can be deadly. Even in moderate countries such as Jordan, men sometimes kill women to uphold family \u201chonour\u201d. The murderers\u2014usually a father or brother\u2014often escape with light sentences. \u201cIf I go out with a boyfriend in Beirut it\u2019s fine,\u201d says a Lebanese Christian woman. \u201cBut in the villages, people will say, \u2018Look, she\u2019s seeing him and they\u2019re not married\u2019.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Some among the region\u2019s ever more globalised young are pushing back. Grindr and Tinder, two hook-up apps for gays and straights respectively, have a fair number of users in the Middle East. Men and women mix and, more and more, choose their own partners. When parts of films are cut, such as an explicit scene in \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d, people go online to watch the full version. In Jeddah, if not Riyadh, colourful abayas swing open as unrelated men and women mingle in caf\u00e9s.<\/p>\n<p>A few leaders say they want to give people a break. Hassan Rohani, Iran\u2019s relatively moderate president, has talked about stopping the religious police from fining women for failing to conceal their hair, wrists and bottoms. Such small freedoms, so far only very partially implemented, would be popular.<br \/>\nSome of the region\u2019s moral arbiters do not practise what they preach, as bartenders and madams in posh parts of Europe can attest. Imagine if the vice police cracked down on hypocrisy.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>No sex please, we\u2019re Middle Eastern Jan 2nd 2016 Economist It was a disquieting announcement.
