The country is made up of about 2,000 islands if you include the cays, which are small islands that are formed on coral reefs. Not densely populated, the Bahamas is renowned for its natural beauty, unique culture, and is a popular tropical vacation destination.<br \/>\nThe word\u00a0Bahamas\u00a0is of Spanish origin and means &#8220;Shallow Water&#8221;.<em><br \/>\nNote:\u00a0The areas of Abacos and the Grand Bahama Islands are largely destroyed following the effects of\u00a0<\/em><em>Hurricane Dorian<\/em><em>, which made landfall on both islands on September 1, 2019. Travel in and out of the islands is difficult and will be off limits for travelers for the coming weeks. Water supply is disrupted due to freshwater wells contaminated with seawater. Roads are peppered by debris and access to tourist spots is essentially blocked. Additionally,\u00a0NHC forecasts and warnings\u00a0state that a tropical storm, Humberto, will be in the area around September 14, 2019.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Understand<br \/>\nCapital:<\/strong> Nassau<br \/>\n<strong>Currency:<\/strong> Bahamian Dollar (BSD)<br \/>\n<strong>Population:<\/strong> 337,000<\/p>\n<div class=\"KkFss\">\n<div class=\"KkFss\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/images.mapsofworld.com\/answers\/2019\/07\/map-of-the-bahamas.jpg?resize=660%2C517&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Image result for bahamas\" width=\"542\" height=\"425\" \/><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>HISTORY<br \/>\nWhere did Columbus land?\u00a0<\/strong>When Christopher Columbus arrived in the West Indies in 1492, he landed on a Bahamian island he named San Salvador. The island now known as San Salvador (formerly called Watling Island) has long been thought to be the island where Columbus landed. But in truth, historians do not agree on the exact site of the landing. The possibility narrows between two islands: San Salvador and Samana Cay, about 80 miles southeast.<br \/>\nArawak Indians inhabited the islands when Christopher Columbus first set foot in the New World on San Salvador Island in 1492. British settlement of the islands began in 1647; the islands became a colony in 1783. The Bahamas were also infamous as a pirate nest with some even trying to form a pirate Republic. Since attaining independence from the UK in 1973, The Bahamas have prospered through tourism and international banking and investment management. Because of its geography, the country is a major transshipment point for illegal drugs, particularly shipments to the US, and its territory is used for smuggling illegal migrants into the US.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CULTURE<br \/>\n<\/strong>The official language spoken in the Bahamas is English. The populace is predictably friendly and more religious than one might expect: the Bahamas have one of the highest ratios of churches per capita in the world, with Baptists being the largest single group. Local newspapers will reveal religious references by elected officials in a manner that exceeds what would be found in the United States. This devotion does nothing to prohibit the activities of visitors nor is it intended to. There is a very &#8220;libertarian&#8221; attitude about personal morals.<br \/>\n<strong>Festivals<br \/>\n<\/strong>The biggest event in the Bahamian calendar is\u00a0Junkanoo, a street carnival held on Boxing Day (December 26) and New Year&#8217;s Day (January 1). Junkanoo groups &#8220;rush&#8221; through the streets of towns, especially\u00a0Nassau, wearing spectacular yet disposable costumes of crepe paper and playing distinctive Junkanoo music, which combines African rhythms with loud brass and cowbells, fusing them together in a medley that veers on cacophony but is exceedingly dancable. The costumes, made from scratch every year, are disposed of on the streets as the party ends and make a great free souvenir to bring home!<br \/>\n<strong>Music. <\/strong>There are many types of music known in the Bahamian culture but the four most prevalent forms of music are Calypso, Soca, Junkanoo and Rake and scrape. The music of the Bahamas is associated primarily with junkanoo, a celebration which occurs on Boxing Day and again on New Year&#8217;s Day. Parades and other celebrations mark the ceremony. Groups like The Baha Men, Ronnie Butler and Kirkland Bodie have gained massive popularity in Japan, the United States and elsewhere.<br \/>\n<strong>Calypso. <\/strong>Calypso is a style of Afro-Caribbean music that originated in Trinidad and Tobago during the early to mid 20th century. This form of music has spread through many parts of the Caribbean, mainly the Bahamas.<br \/>\n<strong>Soca. <\/strong>Soca is a form of music which involves dance and originated from calypso music. Originally it combined the melodic rhythmic sound of calypso with firm percussion and local chutney music. Soca music has grown in the last 20 years primarily by musicians from various Anglophone Caribbean countries including Trinidad, Guyana, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Barbados, Grenada, Saint Lucia, Antigua and Barbuda, United States Virgin Islands, The Bahamas, Dominica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Jamaica and Belize.<br \/>\n<strong>Rake and scrape. <\/strong>Rake and scrape music comes from the musical traditions of the Turks and Caicos Islands, and is characterized by the use of a saw as the primary instrument. It was brought by immigrants from those islands from the 1920s to about the 1940s, who settled on Cat Island, and elsewhere. Rake and Scrape is traditionally used to accompany the Bahamian Quadrille and the heel-toe polka all relics of the initial mixture of Africa and Europe. Many of these Turks and Caicos Islanders became some of the most famous musicians in the Bahamas. Many eventually moved back to their homelands, bringing with them junkanoo. Turks and Caicos are now the second home for junkanoo.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CLIMATE<br \/>\n<\/strong>Tropical marine; moderated by warm waters of Gulf Stream. Hurricanes and other tropical storms cause extensive flood and wind damage. Can be cool if trade winds shift. During summer months, temperature in the Bahamas rarely goes above 90\u00b0F (32\u00b0C). The normal climate during winter is mild with temperatures around 60\u00b0F (16\u00b0C). The Northern and Western islands, Grand Bahama Island, Great Abaco, Andros and Eleuthera are somewhat cooler than the southern islands. The Bahamas hurricane season runs between June and November and rain storms are expected during this period.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GEOGRAPHY<br \/>\n<\/strong>The Bahamas archipelago are in fact the tops of banks that were formed some time between 90,000 and 120 years ago from coral reef formation. The well known pink sand beaches of the Bahamas get their vibrant appearance from the fractured pieces of seashell combined with the sand. The highest point in the Bahamas is Mount Alvernia on Cat Island, which is 63 meters (over 200 feet) high.<br \/>\n<strong>Wildlife. <\/strong>Wildlife in Bahamas contains various species. Many different breed of crabs can be found on the beaches. Hermit and Cardisoma guanhumi are two of the land crabs to be noted frequently in the island. The wild horses of Abaco are famous in The Bahamas.<br \/>\nDuring a tour of the Bahamas, tourists can come across various other species including the Bahamas Hutia, numerous frogs, rocky raccoon, snails such as Cerion, cicada, blind cave fish, ants and reptiles.<br \/>\nBahamas wildlife features a wide range of amazing birds. Parrots and pigeons are two of the most common and popular birds found in The Bahamas.<br \/>\nThe Bahamas is also home to numerous aquatic life. Sharks, manatees, dolphins, frogfish, angelfish, starfish and turtles can be viewed in the waters surrounding The Bahamas. Apart from numerous species of fish, tourists can spot several types of worms also.<br \/>\n<strong>Terrain. <\/strong>Long, flat coral formations with some low rounded hills. The highest point is Mount Alvernia (63 m), on\u00a0Cat Island.\u00a0Grand Bahama Island\u00a0features breathtaking white sandy beaches, beautifully clear turquoise blue waters and plenty of lush, tropical foliage.<br \/>\n<strong>Electricity. <\/strong>Officially 120 V 60 Hz, which is identical to the U.S. and Canadian standard. Outlets are North American grounded outlets, identical to standard U.S. and Canadian wall outlets.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GOVERNMENT<br \/>\n<\/strong>The Bahamas is an independent member of the Commonwealth of Nations. The political and legal traditions of Bahamas closely follow the British ones, owing to their commonwealth membership.<br \/>\nThe country has a parliamentary form of democracy and regular elections are held. The Bahamian senate consists of 16 members, who are appointed by the Governor-General. The Governor-General also appoints the Chief Justice on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Privy Council of the United Kingdom serves as the highest appellate court.<br \/>\nThe local government districts in Bahamas elect local councils for town planning, business licenses, traffic issues and maintenance of government buildings. Lower level town councils are also accorded minor responsibilities in some large districts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ISLANDS<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>New Providence<\/strong>\u00a0(Nassau,\u00a0Paradise Island).

To visit these islands you usually have to be a passenger on the cruise line that owns the island.<br \/>\nDolphin Encounters is an all natural seawater dolphin facility with Atlantic Bottlenose Dolphins and California Sea Lions located on Blue Lagoon Island (Salt Cay), a private island retreat and tourist attraction 5 km (three miles) from Nassau, Bahamas.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GET IN<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Visa policy of the Bahamas. <\/strong>Almost all Western countries do not require a visa. Some exceptions are Jordan, Serbia, Romania, Guatemala, Finland, Indonesia, Ukraine, Russia, Cambodia, Czech Republic, Kosovo, Qatar, Latvia, Saudi Arabia, Italy, Bulgaria, Estonia, Uzbekistan, Austria, Poland and Croatia (this list is\u00a0not\u00a0exhaustive). British diplomatic posts charge \u00a350 to process a Bahamian visa application and an extra \u00a370 if the authorities in the Bahamas require the visa application to be referred to them. The authorities in the Bahamas can also decide to charge an additional fee if they correspond with you directly.<br \/>\n<strong>By Plane. <\/strong>The largest airports in the Bahamas are at the capital\u00a0Nassau, on New Providence, and\u00a0Freeport, on Grand Bahama. Smaller airports are scattered throughout the other islands. The Bahamas has six international airports the largest being the Lynden Pindling International Airport on the west side of Nassau.<br \/>\nFor those who own a pilot&#8217;s license: as the first country to accept Light Sport Aircraft (LSA) Pilot license from the US, flying in on your own plane may be a great option. It would not only provide you with great scenery throughout your flight into the Bahamas, but also become the most convenient way to get around those islands. The same privileges and limitations as if you are flying in the US apply.<br \/>\n<strong>By Boat. <\/strong>The Bahamas are a popular port of call for cruise ships plying the Caribbean. The capital,\u00a0Nassau, on\u00a0New Providence Island\u00a0is one of the world&#8217;s busiest cruise ship ports, and is well served by ships that originate from\u00a0Florida.\u00a0Freeport\u00a0on\u00a0Grand Bahama Island\u00a0is a growing destination as well.<br \/>\nMost island groups have customs and immigration available for those arriving by yacht. The customs fee for a private yacht is $150 for 35&#8242; and under and $300 for over 35&#8242;.<br \/>\nRoyal Caribbean has their own island in the Bahamas called Coco Cay. This island is leased by Royal Caribbean, rather than being fully owned such as Disney&#8217;s ownership arrangement for Castaway Cay. It is strictly for Royal Caribbean cruisers. The island has 25 little shops for souvenirs and their own private beaches, as well as water games in the middle of the clear crystal blue ocean. They have a bbq and main picnic area with the cruise employees as well as the people that Royal Caribbean hire to live and work on the island. Royal Caribbean is busy all year round because of the hot climate in the Bahamas, that they have frequent travelers through all the months of the year.<br \/>\nDisney&#8217;s Castaway Cay, formerly known as Gorda Cay, is a privately owned island near the island of Abaco, close to Sandy Point. This island differs from most of the leased cays in the fact that it is privately owned by The Walt Disney Company and has its own dock so that tendering is not necessary. Castaway Cay has separate areas for families, teens and adults. The island also contains a fiber optic network which connects to the ship.<br \/>\nAdditionally, a regular passenger ferry operated by\u00a0Bale\u00e0ria Caribbean\u00a0runs daily between\u00a0Fort Lauderdale,\u00a0Florida\u00a0and\u00a0Freeport, in the\u00a0Bahamas.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GET AROUND<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>By Plane. <\/strong>Bahamasair\u00a0offers a comprehensive network radiating out from\u00a0Nassau\u00a0and covering most population centers. However, fares are expensive, frequencies are low, planes are small and the airline is notorious for extensive delays, and many travellers in a hurry opt to charter planes instead.<br \/>\n<strong>By Bus. <\/strong>Nassau\/New Providence have a system of buses called\u00a0jitneys, discussed in the\u00a0Nassau\u00a0article. Bus travel on the other islands (with the exception of Grand Bahama) is very limited.<br \/>\n<strong>By Taxi.<\/strong> Taxis are very expensive. A short ride from the airport to Cable beach costs $18, to downtown is $26. Between Cable beach and downtown expect to pay $15-$20 with no room to negotiate.<br \/>\n<strong>By Boat and Yacht. <\/strong>Mail boats serve almost all populated islands in the Bahamas, and are amongst the cheapest way to reach many areas, though far from the fastest or most comfortable. The government has a mailboat schedule of mailboat routes online\u00a0which may or may not reflect reality.<br \/>\nWindward Islands, a yacht charter company, can take care of all charter requirements, from bareboat to crewed yacht in the Bahamas (starting Abaco).<br \/>\n<strong>Language.<\/strong> English\u00a0is the main and official language of the Bahamas. Tourist resorts may have staff who can speak other languages, including Spanish, French, German, and, less frequently, others.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DO<br \/>\nDiving:<\/strong>\u00a0The &#8220;shallow seas&#8221; of the Bahamas lie over an extensive submerged limestone platform, with high points here and there just breaking the surface to form an archipelago. The climate is good for diving year-round, and hurricanes seldom strike. All the inhabited islands have local diving, and some have extensive inland cave systems. Nassau on New Providence is the base for liveaboard cruises.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MONEY<br \/>\n<\/strong>The local currency is the\u00a0Bahamian dollar\u00a0(B$), but it&#8217;s tied to the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio and US dollars are accepted everywhere at par. There is thus no need for Americans to change money, and many tourist-oriented businesses will even give change back in US$. Keep an eye out for the famous (but now rare)\u00a0three-dollar bill\u00a0and\u00a015-cent coin, both made to ease the 1966 transition from British pounds to dollars, $3 being roughly equivalent to \u00a31 and $0.15 approximating a shilling.<br \/>\n<strong>Shopping. <\/strong>There is very little made in the Bahamas, but some luxury goods can be purchased at a bargain. Salespeople in the straw market have a very direct but often humorous manner of negotiating the price of a product. A sense of humor is greatly appreciated in this island nation.<br \/>\nBeware of purchasing Cuban cigars. The vast majority of &#8220;Cubans&#8221; for sale in the Bahamas are counterfeit. Only buy cigars from reputable and dedicated tobacconists, do not buy on the street, in the market, or from rinky-dink combination cigar\/liquor shops. Real Cubans cost upwards of $30 per cigar. If the price is $10, it&#8217;s 100% fauxhiba. If you do plan to buy cigars, some online research may assist you in identifying authentic Cubans.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CUISINE<br \/>\n<\/strong>As you&#8217;d expect in an island nation, seafood is very popular. The national dish is\u00a0conch\u00a0(pronounced &#8220;conk&#8221; with a hard K), a type of mollusk, served deep-fried (&#8220;cracked&#8221;) or raw with a twist of lemon, and as elsewhere in the Caribbean, the classic accompaniment is\u00a0peas and rice.<br \/>\nOrdinary meals can be purchased for anywhere from $5-25 a plate. Authentic island food can be found at the\u00a0Fish Fry, a collection of small open-air restaurants where many locals hang out. Meals can be had for about $8. Sunday night the locals flock to this area for some authentic Bahamian nightlife. You can find fast-food chains such as KFC or McDonalds, especially in the downtown areas, but as it is a highly touristed country, you can find many nice restaurants serving many different cuisines. Most restaurants serve American or British food, though you can easily find the normal island flair, especially during the Fish Fry during June. A 15% service charge is added to the bill at most establishments; additional tips are optional.<br \/>\nService is distinct from the American standard. There is a concentration on the customer at hand. You are expected to patiently wait your turn. At fast food restaurants the server will take care of only the first customer until they have left the service area. Don&#8217;t expect to be in a hurry even at a fast food establishment.<br \/>\nService in the Bahamas takes place at a relaxed pace. Travelers can expect a leisurely pace to their meal. Expect polite, if slow, service at most establishments.<br \/>\n<strong>DRINK<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Soda.<\/strong> Soda can be pretty pricy in the hotels, and you will find it only on a soda tap if you are in a good restaurant; otherwise, you will usually get it in a can. The cheapest way to get this would be to go to a local &#8220;Food Mart.&#8221;<br \/>\n&#8220;Goombay Punch&#8221; is the local soda. It has a pineapple flavor and is what the locals call a &#8220;Sweet&#8221; soda versus a cola. It is sold in cans at all grocery stores and also available in almost every Bahamian eatery.<br \/>\nNon-alcoholic malt beverages are also very popular. The primary brand of choice is Vita-Malt.<br \/>\n<strong>Beer.\u00a0<\/strong>Kalik\u00a0is the national beer of the Bahamas and is always served at &#8220;all-inclusive&#8221; resorts. There are three rather distinct types: &#8220;Kalik regular&#8221; which has 4% alcohol and a smooth refreshing taste, &#8220;Kalik Light&#8221; which has been often compared to a Budweiser is a light lager which delivers the same great taste as the regular kalik but with a lower alcohol content and less calories, &#8220;Kalik Gold&#8221; has 7% alcohol, though very potent it has an excellent taste, which gives you an extra feel of the island. Guinness is also very popular.<br \/>\nA new beer is available &#8212; called\u00a0Sands. It can be obtained at many resorts and in the local liquor stores. It is a similar style product to Kalik. Sands is now readily available in both regular and light.<br \/>\nImported beer can be incredibly expensive in the hotels but is not overly priced in bars and liquor stores. Cases of beer are available in a variety of Duty Free liquor stores.<br \/>\nIn Freeport, the Port Lucaya Marketplace and Marina has many bars offering two Kaliks (and some other brews) for $5.<br \/>\nThe drinking age is 18, however it is weakly enforced and teenage drinking is common.<br \/>\n<strong>Hard liquors. <\/strong>The Bahamas has a lot of liquor stores in relation to the population of the country. You can find liquors stores downtown, in the hotels, the port lucaya marketplace and as you continue to tour the island, if you may not be sure of exactly where one may be located please feel free to ask for assistance.<br \/>\n<strong>Rum. <\/strong>This the best choice of drinks in the Bahamas. It&#8217;s as cheap as you can get ($2-$10 a bottle), tastes great, and it&#8217;s made fresh by 3 different companies, the largest being the Bacardi Rum factory on\u00a0New Providence\u00a0south of Nassau, where you can take tours and get free drinks if you go on a 2-hour bus ride (Bacardi closed down!).<br \/>\nThe Bahamas has its own native rum to offer with a variety of brands which include Ron Ricardo rum, Ole Nassau Rum and a very popular Fire in the Hole Rum, while this fire in the hole rum is gold in color it has a very distinct bottle label which is sure to be a good conversation piece in the home. The Ron Ricardo rums and Ole Nassau rums both come in a variety of flavours. Ron Ricardo has the best leading coconut rum used to make the ever so popular island drink &#8220;The Bahama Mamma&#8221;. Other flavours include mango, pineapple and banana, a gold rum, light rum and one 151 rum. The Ole Nassau rum also offers all of the flavors to that of the Ron Ricardo. Its bottle label too is very unique and creative portraying a pirate ship along the Bahama Islands.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ACCOMMODATION<br \/>\n<\/strong>Accommodation on the Bahamas is expensive, and there is virtually no backpacker\/hostel-type lodging. The cheapest hotels start at around US$ 70, and most hotels cost US$200-300\/night, with the very best resorts easily pushing up above US$500. Deals may be available in the summer off-season though.<br \/>\nBe aware the Bahamas charge a\u00a0Service Fee or Resort Fee\u00a0to every person staying overnight. Hotels collect the fee of\u00a0$18 per night per person\u00a0as well as a\u00a0$6 per person one time bellhop fee. This is an addition to the rate of the room and is not optional and cannot be waived. Often tourists first hear about this when checking into their hotel for the first time.<br \/>\nThe Bahamas Government levies a\u00a0Hotel Guest Tax\u00a0which is payable by each guest. This tax is\u00a010%\u00a0of the hotel rate, it submitted monthly to the Bahamas Government by the hotel operator.<br \/>\nHotels in the Bahamas may levy a number of\u00a0other charges\u00a0upon guests in addition to the standard bill, including; gratuities-maid\/bellman), a hotel &#8216;Levy&#8217; (Promotion Board), cable, telephone, water &amp; sewerage, energy surcharge, pool\/towels.<br \/>\nMost hotels and resorts in the Bahamas are located in\u00a0New Providence\u00a0(Nassau) and neighboring\u00a0Paradise Island. The rest of the country remains rather off the beaten track for tourism, and places like\u00a0Eleuthera, despite being 100 miles long, has only three hotels.<br \/>\nTourism is the main industry followed by banking. 50 percent of the national GDP is generated by tourism.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SAFETY<br \/>\n<\/strong>By the middle of the year 2007, the country had already recorded 42 murders. The murder count for 2010 was 96. Police statistics will show that most murders are linked to domestic violence or gang related disputes, mostly fueled by competition in the illegal drug trade.<br \/>\n<strong>Penalties. <\/strong>Penalties for breaking the law can be more severe than in the United States for similar offenses. Persons violating Bahamian laws, even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Police enforcement is aggressive in tourist areas, as drug dealers are known to frequent areas where tourists congregate. Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs in the Bahamas are strict, and convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.<br \/>\n<strong>Health<br \/>\n<\/strong>The adult\u00a0HIV\/AIDS\u00a0prevalence rate has reached 3.0% or 1 in 33 adults.<br \/>\nTap water\u00a0is generally potable, but bottled water is recommended for visitors.<\/p>\n<p><strong>RESPECT<br \/>\n<\/strong>Bahamians are good-natured but do not suffer fools gladly.<\/p>\n<p>==============================================================<\/p>\n<p>Bahamas
