Mild water bars necessitate high-clearance vehicles.

This has grown in considerably over the years and travel time is about double what it was 10 years ago due to denser ground cover and logging mess.<br \/>\nThe views from the top are well worth the effort, and it is Ross Bate\u2019s local favourite destination.
