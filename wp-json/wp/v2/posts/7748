Thanks to a thriving wetland of international importance, the area is visited by over 100,000 migrating water birds every year. It\u2019s a migration corridor for Tundra Swans, Greater White-fronted Geese and other waterfowl, and it\u2019s the largest regional locale for wintering birds of prey in interior BC.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Along with 303 species of birds, the\u00a0CVWMA is home to 60 species of mammals, 17 species of fish, six species of reptiles, and six species of amphibians. Many species at risk find refuge here, including Forster\u2019s Terns, the Western Grebe, American Bitterns, Great Blue Herons, the Western Painted Turtle and the Northern Leopard Frog.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">An extensive trail system facilitates access to this 17,000-acre area year-round. Relax with a guided or self-guided canoe trip, gentle hiking, cycling, snowshoeing, and cross-country skiing. The Wildlife Interpretation Centre offers a variety of educational programs and events for schools, groups and visitors. Or indulge your competitive side in the annual Blue Heron half-marathon and 10 km run.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The area is managed by the Creston Valley Wildlife Management Area to prevent invasive species from\u00a0establishing themselves in the wetland, particularly targeting cattails and reed canary grass.\u00a0This is done by periodically drawing down the water level of the marshes. Areas that get choked with vegetation are rehabilitated by drying them up and then ploughing up the ground to get rid of the seed bank that develops over time.&#8221; This also ensures broad biodiversity by \u00a0preventing one plant species from dominating the region.<\/p>\n<p><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span id=\"Wildlife_Interpretation_Centre\"><strong>Wildlife Interpretation Centre.<\/strong> L<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">ocated 11 kilometre west of Creston off Hwy 3 and is<br \/>\nopen May to October.

This followed nearly 26 years of persistence by conservationists and biologists and nearby residents who wished to protect Duck Lake and its adjoining wetland habitats. Subsequently, with assistance from BC Hydro and Ducks Unlimited by a system of dykes and other control structures were built to manage water levels in Duck Lake, and hence the wetlands, reducing the impact of yearly drought and flood cycles.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Archaeological evidence indicates that First Nations have lived in the area for thousands of years.
