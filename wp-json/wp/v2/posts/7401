This is a prime grizzly bear habitat with a high likelihood of seeing bears feeding on the lush, treeless northeast side of the valley across from the trail. Hiking in groups of six or more is a safe way to hike in bear country.<br \/>\nThe trail leads to a pass, an excellent vantage point.\u00a0<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Difficulty:<\/strong> C2<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Elevation gain:<\/strong> 893m (2930&#8242;)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Key elevations: <\/strong>TH\u00a01480m (4855&#8242;); Campsite 1950m (6396&#8242;); Pass below Whitewater Peak\u00a02180m (7150&#8242;); Glacial lake\u00a02287m (7500&#8242;).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Distance:<\/strong> 6.75kms one-way\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Time:<\/strong> 8-9 hours\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Season:<\/strong> late July through September<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Assess:<\/strong> Moderate<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Map:<\/strong> 82K\/3 Nakusp<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Drive<\/strong>:<br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">From New Denver:<\/span> Junction of Hwys 6 and 31A, drive 19.7km (12.2 miles) toward Kaslo on Highway 31A (passing the branch to Sandon at 8.4 km) to the abandoned town of Retallack.

Drive three sets of switchbacks (6 ramps in all), the first ramp rising up and left. At 0.3 km from Highway 31A, the old road to Mount Brennan, Lyle Peak and the Whitewater trail is encountered (do not use, private property). <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Beyond, several roads branch east and west from the switchbacks (and also left from the next to the last ramp) but stay on the switchbacks.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">3.2km Parking lot and a new trail to Whitewater Mountain. 1480m (4855&#8242;)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Trail:<\/strong> Follow the deteriorating road that becomes a well-defined trail as it climbs through a beautiful forest of spruce and red cedar along the roaring Whitewater Creek. The original mining trail traversed through several grizzly-feeding locations on the north side of the creek. It was deemed prudent to move this part of the trail. The new trail climbs through wet forest to reach talus slopes and good views. It is a pity that the new trail had to be constructed for the wildflowers along the old trail are nothing short of spectacular. Depending on the time of the year, a short venture up the old trail will provide excellent wildflower photos. Keep your eyes and ears active.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">After about 1.5 hours on the trail, there is a campsite with a creek and outhouse. Either head directly up the lateral moraine on the right to intersect the original mine trail, or traverse laterally to the right to the mine trail. From either location the old trail is easily followed across meadows and beside streams, slowly gaining elevation. Good views of Whitewater Peak and Mt Brennan.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">At 5.7 km, the trail levels at the end of the ridge are 2226m (7300&#8242;). Views expand to MacBeth and Dryden. The trail descends to the pass between Whitewater Canyon and South Cooper Creek valley to the NE. 6km\u00a0 2180m (7150&#8242;).\u00a0 There&#8217;s a lot of old mining junk, an old pipeline and a good potential campsite.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Walk up the glacial debris to the turquoise lake beneath Whitewater glacier in 15 minutes 6.7km 2287m (7500&#8242;). Serpentine rock boulders to take-home pieces litter the ground. Scramble NW up to the col right of the glacier. Look across Kane Creek Canyon 3500 feet below.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">On the descent, avoid following the old trail down into the creek bed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The trail starts high on the canyon wall and quickly breaks out of the forest giving great views of the surroundings.
