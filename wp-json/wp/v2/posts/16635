Thousands of feet above the Nevada desert, in a part of Great Basin National Park that tourists rarely see, park ecologist Gretchen Baker neared the top of Mount Washington and raised her binoculars. There just below, sprouting directly from the limestone, grew some of the oldest living things on Earth.<\/p>\n<p>Great Basin bristlecone pines, their dense pale trunks twisted like thick rope by centuries of gusting wind and rain, thrive here in part because so little else does. At altitudes near 11,000 feet along Nevada\u2019s rocky Snake \u00a0Range, there are no grasses, no brush, few pests, and no competition. No people to start wildfires. No nearby trees to spread pathogens.<\/p>\n<p>With nothing around to kill them, these ancient beasts are left alone year after year to simply do what they do: store water in needles that can live for decades and pack on the teensiest bit of heft at a time. The wood grows so slowly it gets too dense for beetles or disease to penetrate.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop ImageGroup__Wrapper\" aria-label=\"Image Pair\" data-bumper-index=\"1\">\n<div class=\"ImageGroup__Images\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure id=\"e79477de-9ba2-425d-8d5f-c3245850ded7_0\" class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/331dae6d-4eb4-4baa-b3aa-342fbb82030f\/02_MM9624_210908_11427-Edit.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=3414\" alt=\"\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"CenterCropFrame\">\n<div class=\"CenterCropFrame__Frame\">\n<div class=\"CenterCropFrame__Child-Wrap\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure id=\"e79477de-9ba2-425d-8d5f-c3245850ded7_1\" class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/dd4ed16d-c65b-47e0-b763-a70e8f1db759\/03_CaliSW-UT-6-7-09-121.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=3846\" alt=\"\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption Caption--hideEndBug\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate\"><span class=\"RichText\"><strong>Left<\/strong>: This young bristlecone pine was spared during the Phillips Ranch Fire in 2000, which killed thousands of others.

But that argument grew more complicated this month after a Chilean researcher used unusual techniques to date a tree of a different species, a Patagonian cypress. If correct, his work would make that South American conifer the newest oldest thing.<\/p>\n<p>The claim has tree researchers abuzz but skeptical, at least in part because the cypress, growing in a temperate rainforest, appears to live such a different life than a bristlecone. Despite their longevity both the bristlecones and the interloper are now facing questions about how well they\u2019ll navigate the coming decades.<\/p>\n<h2><b>An old rival<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Patagonian cypresses, also known as alerces, are native to Chile and Argentina and have long been recognized as the world\u2019s second longest-lived tree species. The previous record-setting alerce was identified in the early 1990s by counting tree rings on a cut stump; it was\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/10.1126\/science.260.5111.1104\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">more than 3,600 years old<\/a>. (The oldest known giant sequoia, the third longest-lived species, was identified the same way and lived to 3,266.)<br \/>\nBut earlier this month,\u00a0a story in\u00a0<i>Science<\/i>\u00a0by Gabriel Popkin revealed that environmental scientist\u00a0Jonathan Barichivich\u00a0and the researcher who first identified that old alerce had been studying another tree in a Chilean national park. The researchers used a T-shaped increment borer to drill in and remove a core sample from the moss-draped cypress. The boring device couldn\u2019t reach the center of the tree, which is more than a dozen feet in diameter. But by combining their core sample with tree-ring information from other alerces, and using computer modeling, the pair estimated the tree was roughly 5,400 years old, with an 80 percent chance it was more than 5,000 years old.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--below-paragraph InlineElement--content-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/b41e5cfe-e85e-464b-8d0a-dd8efc35fb63\/08_IMG_5253.jpg?w=1272&amp;h=1908\" alt=\"\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate\"><span class=\"RichText\">By combining a partial core sample with computer modeling, researchers in South America believe they can show that this Patagonian cypress tree, also called an alerce, towering out of a ravine in Chile, is at least 5,000 years old, which would make it Earth\u2019s oldest living tree. Some experts are skeptical.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><span class=\"RichText Caption__Credit\" aria-label=\"Photograph by Jonathan Barichivich\">PHOTOGRAPH BY JONATHAN BARICHIVICH<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<p>The research has not been peer-reviewed yet, but Barichivich has shared his findings at conferences. Nate Stephenson, an emeritus scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey, who has studied giant sequoias for four decades, finds the results interesting, but is withholding judgment until Barichivich publishes a paper detailing his methods. Still, \u201cthe prospect is certainly exciting,\u201d Stephenson tells Popkin.<\/p>\n<p>Others, though, are quite skeptical. Peter Brown, founder of\u00a0Rocky Mountain Tree Ring Research, which gathers information on the world\u2019s oldest trees, says Barichivich\u2019s approach is too novel to make such a bold claim before publication. \u201cThere are many assumptions necessary for extrapolating total age from that,\u201d Brown says.<\/p>\n<p>Brown doesn\u2019t doubt the tree is significant. The partial core alone seems to show the tree was at least 2,400 years old, which would put it among the top 10 oldest trees on Brown\u2019s list. But Brown has other reasons to be suspicious. For example, \u201cthis new estimated age is over 1,500 years older than the oldest known (alerce) tree to date,\u201d Brown says.<\/p>\n<p>Brown also sees significant differences between the types of environments that tend to support the very oldest trees and the surroundings of the Patagonian cypress. In an isolated, austere landscape, like the snowy, rocky homes of slow-growing bristlecone, trees can just keep on going. Mossy rainforests, on the other hand, are full of life\u2014and threats.<br \/>\nScientists\u00a0still argue\u00a0about\u00a0why some trees\u00a0are able to\u00a0live so long. \u201cMy contention is that trees don\u2019t necessarily die from old age like mammals,\u201d Brown says. \u201cSomething has to come along and kill them.\u201d<br \/>\nBarichivich understands the skepticism. He says his colleague has found another alerce stump whose tree rings can all be counted and show it to be about 4,100 years old. (That data is also not yet published.) He also argues that tree-ring data suggests alerce actually grow more slowly than bristlecones, meaning their wood is also very dense.<br \/>\nAnd as\u00a0part of a recent research team\u00a0that analyzed the relationship between the world\u2019s longest-lived trees and climate, Barichivich believes the two species\u2019 worlds are similar in the most important ways. The Chilean Coast Range is nothing like the American West, he says, \u201cbut there are special conditions here, too.\u201d<br \/>\nHis ancient alerce grows on a cloudy south-facing slope, where the annual mean temperature is roughly 45 degrees Fahrenheit. It\u2019s found in a ravine, protected from fire and until recently from humans. Barichivich says his own Chilean grandfather, who worked as a ranger in the park, discovered the tree in the early 1970s and may well have been the first person to touch it.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--below-paragraph InlineElement--browser-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\" data-bumper-index=\"7\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/e5a60c61-3c54-46d5-833c-22a7a2c12f48\/05_MM9624_210909_12487-Edit-My-Ng-Low-2.jpg?w=2520&amp;h=1680\" alt=\"\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">Bristlecones live in harsh environments, often sprouting out of dry, rocky soils above 11,000 feet where little else can survive.

Climate change is also drying out the region, which could threaten the tree\u2019s water uptake.<br \/>\nBristlecones, too, are seeing a changing world. On a cloudless day last July,\u00a0Gretchen Baker\u2019s pickup lurched up a gravel road so steep it felt at times like it might tumble off the mountain.\u00a0Anna Schoettle, a plant ecophysiologist with the U.S. Forest Service, bounced around in the back seat. They were here to explain how the ancient pines might weather rising temperatures.<br \/>\nThe oldest living sequoias were seedlings more than 3,200 years ago, around the time of the Trojan War. Back then, the oldest bristlecones living today would already have been around for 1,600 years.<\/p>\n<p>One reason for that is the bristlecone\u2019s capacity to handle stress. As soil erosion or root decay and age weaken a bristlecone\u2019s trunk or branches, the entire tree does not die\u2014only the portion under direct stress. Instead, these majestic beings practice \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fs.fed.us\/rm\/highelevationwhitepines\/About\/photo-tour\/strip-bark.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">strip barking<\/a>,\u201d allowing thin bands of living tissue beneath the bark to curl up the tree delivering water from healthy roots. On some bristlecones, as little as 5 percent of what you see may still, in fact, be alive.<br \/>\n\u201cYou won\u2019t usually see a super old tree that has bark all the way around it,\u201d Baker says. \u201cIt\u2019s just got this one little living part. Whole portions of the tree are now just really artistic-looking dead wood.\u201d<br \/>\nBristlecones live\u00a0across a broad altitude range, from about 6,500 feet up to more than 11,000 feet. They have survived all kinds of conditions. The trees are typically spaced far enough apart that even the occasional lightning-sparked fire rarely spreads beyond a few acres.<br \/>\nBut as we rounded a corner in Baker\u2019s truck, an image of the planet\u2019s new reality came into focus. We rolled by acre upon acre of burned husks. A hotter, bigger, more powerful fire, fueled in part by a changing climate, had blown through in the last few decades, wiping out many bristlecones.<br \/>\nWarming temperatures, drought, and more explosive fire pose new threats to these ancient trees, but mostly at the lower end of their range. Bristlecones are also susceptible to blister rust, an imported fungus that has killed millions of related trees, including whitebark pines in Yellowstone National Park. So far it has not appeared in the wild in Great Basin bristlecones.<br \/>\n\u201cBlister rust is a threat, absolutely,\u201d says Stanley Kitchen, an emeritus research scientist with the Forest Service. \u201cHow big of a threat is something I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s a big question mark for me.\u201d<br \/>\nBaker, Schoettle, and Kitchen worry that bristlecones at that lower edge of their elevation range are likely to have a rough time in coming years.<br \/>\nBut \u201cI don\u2019t worry about the direct effects of climate change on the upper half, where it\u2019s most at home,\u201d Kitchen says. \u201cIt would take, I think, even more climate change than is projected to make them disappear.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/article>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What&#8217;s the oldest tree on Earth\u2014and will it survive climate change?
