A young woman walked up, and like a young warrior preparing for battle, she said: \u201cI don\u2019t usually do this, and I know this isn\u2019t a hot button topic anymore\u2026 But, I think abortion is wrong. It\u2019s not a form of birth control, and people who have them should be arrested for murder.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s face it, it\u2019s loud out there. It seems like everyone has something to say and somewhere to say it.<br \/>\nOur Facebook feeds are littered with articles, posts, and images from all types of people. For some of us, this is difficult to handle, but editing out the ones we disagree with until our feed looks more like an echo board of own thoughts, takes time and you don\u2019t hear the other side &#8211; if we\u2019re not careful, we\u2019ll treat people this way. Editing out the ones we disagree with until we\u2019re surrounded by people who are just like us. Then we wonder why we\u2019re so divided.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How do I listen to someone when I disagree with them?<\/strong><br \/>\nIt takes a lot of forgiveness, compassion, patience, and courage to listen in the face of disagreement. We must work to hear the person not just the opinion.<br \/>\nWhen someone has a point of view we find difficult to understand, disagreeable, or even offensive, we must look to the set of circumstances that person has experienced that resulted in that point of view. Get their story, their biography, and you\u2019ll open up the real possibility of an understanding that transcends disagreement.<br \/>\nLike the roots of a tree, our stories, which can create our beliefs, are completely unique, and also connected. It is through story that we can find common ground enough to co-exist in the face of great, often necessary, tension.<br \/>\nWhen you find yourself in disagreement, just ask one question: \u201cWill you tell me your story?  I\u2019d love to know how you came to this point of view.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As she spoke to me about her beliefs on abortion, I wanted to stop her, and tell her my story. I\u2019ve sat with two loved ones as they suffered through the difficult decision and consequences of ending a pregnancy. It was a brutal human experience, and gave me an insight to something I never expected to witness. In moments like that, \u201cchoice\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to be the right word.<br \/>\nSo, when she told me they should be arrested for terminating a pregnancy, the familiar burn of disagreement started to fire in me. There were so many things I wanted to say. I wanted to change her mind, to argue, to disagree. It\u2019s a natural response. But, if my story brought me to my beliefs, then I needed to know how her story brought her to her beliefs.<\/p>\n<p>So, I asked: \u201cThank you for sharing that. Tell me your story? I\u2019d love to know how you came to this point of view.\u201d<br \/>\nShe seemed surprised by my interest. \u201cWhy? It doesn\u2019t matter. Your sign said Free Listening, so I gave you something to listen to.\u201d<br \/>\n\u201cGive me more to listen to.\u201d<br \/>\n\u201cThey should be locked up! It\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s not right to go out and sleep with whoever, then just vacuum away the result like it never happened.\u201d She paused\u2026then inhaled the entire world.<br \/>\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s not fair. All I\u2019ve ever wanted to be is a mom. My whole life, I knew I was meant to have children. Then, when I was 18, the doctor told me I\u2019d never have children. My ovaries were damaged, or missing&#8230;it doesn\u2019t matter which. I kept it a secret, and when my husband found out, he left me. I\u2019m alone, my body doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019m old\u2026who will ever love me\u2026\u201d<br \/>\nI wondered if she could hear my heart breaking.<br \/>\n\u201c\u2026so, I guess I get upset when I see people who can get pregnant, who can have kids, who\u2019s bodies work\u2026who can be moms\u2026and they just choose not to\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes, there\u2019s nothing to \u201cdisagree\u201d with. I didn\u2019t need to be right. I just needed to be there. She wiped away a few tears, gave me a hug, and thanked me for listening. She exhaled, and walked back into the RNC circus. Maybe one day, she\u2019ll hear my story.  But today, it was my turn to hear hers. I hope she felt loved.<\/p>\n<p>The truth is, if our love can hold space for paradox, tension, and disagreement, there&#8217;s room for all types of beliefs and opinions. Division is a choice. Life isn&#8217;t a Facebook feed. Our love, our listening, must bring in, not edit out. Dare to listen, dare to be quiet, dare to seek understanding; in the end, it&#8217;s the people we need to love, not their opinions.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>HOW TO LISTEN WHEN YOU DISAGREE July 27, 2016 by Benjamin Mathes \u201cHear the Biography, not the ideology.\u201d \u2014 Agape \u201cWhen you listen, you may learn something new\u201d \u2014 Dalai Lama At the Republican National Convention, Benjamin Mathes put up &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2016\/08\/09\/when-you-disagree\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-5275","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-uncategorized"],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p2Ncip-1n5","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5275","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5275"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5275\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5275"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5275"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5275"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
