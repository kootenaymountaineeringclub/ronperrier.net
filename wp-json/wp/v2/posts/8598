From there, a long ridge extends northeast toward the Columbia River. In the north, another long ridge parallels Beaver River, ending east of the Dawson Group in the Selkirks. The rock is sedimentary and metamorphic, and the ascents are relatively short.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Maps &#8211; 82N\/3 Mount Wheeler, 82N\/2 McMurdo and 82K\/14 Westfall River.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">B.

(The left fork goes south to Bobbie Burns and Vowell Creeks.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">From a camp at the pass, the summits at Spillimacheen Glacier are easily accessible. They can also be reached by trail to a camp (or the cabin) by the mine above the south fork of McMurdo Creek. The McMurdo Creek-Silent Pass route has also been used to access the Sugarloaf Group and the Battle Range.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">If one is approaching from the southeast on Highway 95, one can turn left (west) onto this road system at the towns of Brisco (see Vermont Group) or Spillimacheen, but the drive is longer over inferior roads.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Duncan FSR<\/strong> (high clearance, four-wheel drive at its end) goes up the Duncan River valley from Kootenay Lake, ending at the Glacier National Park boundary at Beaver-Duncan Pass, which begins by crossing to the east side of Duncan River just south of the town of Cooper Creek. Its end is adjacent to the Melville, Sugarloaf and Spillimacheen Groups. The distance to the Spillimacheen Group is well over 100 km from the pavement. See the Crystalline Group, access.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Backpacking to the Carbonate Group to the south is easy. Ascend the glacier, go over the glacial pass just east of David Peak and contour southwest on high alpine meadows to the head of Bobbie Burns Creek, to International Basin in the Carbonates just south of the head of the creek. It is a modest day\u2019s pack.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">An old mining road (now a trail) goes along the north side of Bobbie Burns Creek, below Spillimacheen Mountain, and another branch from Bobbie Burns Creek up Carbonate Creek in the Carbonate Group (another old road).

If the cabin is full, one must camp nearby.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The McMurdo cabin was used in a summer regional traverse from the Bugaboos to Glacier (Rogers Pass).
