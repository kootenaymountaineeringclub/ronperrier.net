My mother never missed the tradition, spending one long weekend at the annual chore. It was stored wrapped in tea towels in the freezer, warmed up and served rolled up with butter. We never ate it any other way. We loved lefse. My mother was half Norwegian, but I don&#8217;t think she developed the lefse habit in her family home. It was only after she spent time with the Perrier family that she learned how. My Grandmother Perrier was Norwegian from North Dakota.<\/p>\n<p>My mother was raised in SW Saskatchewan, trained as a teacher and had her first posting at the country school closest to the Perrier homestead east of Scout Lake Saskatchewan. She eventually taught most of the younger Perrier children &#8211; this was during WWII. My mom boarded at the Perriers and lived there after marrying my father &#8211; it was a big happy household with 10 kids. I think it likely this was when she started making lefse.<br \/>\nAt least two of my dad&#8217;s sisters, Dolores and Violet, were prodigious lefse makers. And some of their children have continued the habit. A routine amount would be four batches of the recipes below, or about 200 pieces of lefse.<\/p>\n<p>Some Poems About Lefse<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Yew tak yust ten big potatoes<br \/>\nDen yew boil dem til dar don,<br \/>\nYew add to dis some sveet cream<br \/>\nAnd by cups it measures vun.<\/p>\n<p>Den yew steal &#8216;tree ounces of butter<br \/>\nAnd vit two fingers pench some salt,<br \/>\nYew beat dis wery lightly<br \/>\nIf it ain&#8217;t gude it is your fault.<\/p>\n<p>Den yew roll dis tin vit flour<br \/>\nAn&#8217; light brown on stove yew bake,<br \/>\nNow call in all Scandihuvians<br \/>\nTew try da fine lefse yew make<\/p>\n<p><i style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">We sat amazed as Mother worked the dough.<br \/>\n<\/i><i style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Could her palms sense when it became too warm?<br \/>\n<\/i><i style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Within those hands a shape began to grow.<br \/>\n<\/i><i style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rolled out, it moved towards its proper form.<\/p>\n<p><\/i><i style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">She sprinkled flour as she rolled them out.<br \/>\n<\/i><i style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The rolling pin moved lightly in her hands.<br \/>\n<\/i><i style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">She turned each lefse over and about,<br \/>\n<\/i><i style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">As swirling worlds take shape when God commands.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><i style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">First rolled up on a stick, and then unrolled;<br \/>\n<\/i><i style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The cookstove added age-spots to each side.<br \/>\n<\/i><i style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Once done, they were removed for us to fold;<\/i><\/p>\n<p><i style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">A simple task that we performed with pride.<br \/>\n<\/i><i style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Each bite one takes can recreate this mood;<br \/>\n<\/i><i style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">What we call &#8220;lefse&#8221; is not merely food.<\/i><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Recipe #1\u00a0<\/strong>(My Aunt Dolores&#8217;s recipe)<br \/>\n\u2022 16 cups riced potatoes \u2013 white russet<br \/>\n\u2022 6 cups flour<br \/>\n\u2022 1\u00bd c butter in pats<br \/>\n\u2022 1 c whipping cream<\/p>\n<p><strong>Recipe #2<\/strong> (Lefsetime &#8211; possibly the recommended recipe)<br \/>\n\u2022 16 cups riced potatoes \u2013 white russet<br \/>\n\u2022 6 cups flour<br \/>\n\u2022 1 cup butter in pats<br \/>\n\u2022 2 cups whipping cream<br \/>\n\u2022 8 tsp sugar<br \/>\n\u2022 4 tsp salt<\/p>\n<p><strong>Equipment.<\/strong> This is available for purchase as a complete kit from\u00a0<a style=\"color: #ff4b33;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.lefsetime.com\">www.lefsetime.com, <\/a>but I could not order online as the site did not accept customers from outside the USA.

Potatoes<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Peel 8 to 10 lbs of russet potatoes. Rinse and cut potatoes in half and then quarters &#8211; a similar size so they are all cooked through at the same time. Boil in salted water until just fork tender &#8211; overcooking makes them mushy and the lefse wet. This will yield 16 cups of riced potatoes equaling 48 lefse rounds. Note: Highly recommend using a good quality brand russet-burbank potato. Kitchen Kleen is one type.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>2. Ricing<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Drain in a large colander and place back into the pot with a tea towel over to absorb moisture from the steam.. Rice but don\u2019t waste time as potatoes need to be warm to melt the butter in the next step (rice them into the empty pot you used for boiling). Make ricing easier &#8211; fill the ricer basket 1\/2 to 2\/3\u2019s of the way full and take it slow &#8211; a lot of pressure all at once and the potatoes will come out too fast and all over. They are very hot and can burn your skin.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>3. Cooling<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>To your 16 cups of riced potatoes, add 1 cup butter in pats so it melts in evenly. Stir a few times to get the butter mixed in well. Cover and refrigerate overnight if desired. If you would like to make lefse the same day, recurrently stir and cool down in the fridge.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>4. Mixing<\/em><\/strong><em>.<br \/>\n<\/em>To your completely cooled potatoes add 2 cups whipping cream, 4 tsp salt, 8 tsp sugar and 6 cups flour. If you have refrigerated overnight, break up the potatoes into small crumbles before adding the remaining ingredients. Once added, stir until most of the flour is worked in (loose crumbles). To get the flour mixed in thoroughly, use hands and knead (like bread dough) 10 \u2013 15 times. Try to get as much mixing done in the bowl to save mess on the counter. Finish mixing in the flour by turning it out onto the counter to incorporate all the flour. You should feel the\u00a0 dough come together into a smooth dough.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>5. Patties<\/em><\/strong><em><br \/>\n<\/em>Using a 1\/3 cup measuring cup, scoop out 48 patties onto a tray or cookie sheet. Then<br \/>\nshape each patty much like you would a hamburger patty \u2013 gently knead between your hands, roll into ball and press flat. It is very important that the edges of your patties are smooth with no cracks. Those small cracks will develop into bigger cracks as you roll. Set your patties aside to rest while you turn on your lefse grill and let it heat to 500 degrees. Note: 1\/3 cup patty will roll into a nice, thin 14 inch round. If you like thicker lefse roll only to 12 inches. If you like the thinness but prefer a smaller sheet, a 1\/4 cup patty rolls into a 12 inch round. Can use a No.12 disher to speed up the scooping, it\u2019s equivalent to 1\/3 cup.<br \/>\nMake all of your patties in advance to speed things along. Let them rest for 5 minutes before rolling or place on a cookie sheet, separate layers with saran and refrigerate overnight.<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.lefsetime.com\/how-to-make-lefse\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwiL9Zbf_pjfAhXQTd8KHZrXChAQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/www.lefsetime.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/06\/making-lefse-transfer-2.jpg\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"529\" height=\"353\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>6. <\/strong><strong><em>Rolling.<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>The dough rolls best when cool. Gently roll forward and back using mostly the weight of the pin, only a very slight downward pressure so that your patty becomes a small oval. Rolling lefse is like rolling pie crust, start from the middle and work out.<br \/>\nThen either rotate your board slightly or change your angle and roll forward and back. Continue rotating or switching your angles so that you keep your lefse round and of even thickness. Keep rolling until you have achieved the size of lefse you\u2019d like.<br \/>\nPreparation is the key to success with rolling. Round pastry boards are great for rolling lefse. They have size guides to indicate how large your sheets are and can be a great guide to round sheets. Prep your pastry board by spreading out about 1 cup of flour into a circle just a bit bigger than the sheet of lefse you intend to roll to start. Rub the flour thoroughly into your pastry cloth and add a bit of flour between each sheet, paying special attention to the centre as it tends to build up the most moisture and could cause sticking. A flour dredger is a very handy tool for that step. Avoid wet spots on the pastry cloth.<br \/>\nPrep your rolling pin by working flour into every groove of your pin. This can be sped up by rolling your pin directly into flour. For example, place a cup of flour onto a tray and roll your pin back and forth through the flour. Be sure to rub flour in on any missing spots and to rub in more flour between each lefse sheet. You can also use a rolling pin cover or stockinette; it functions the same as a pastry cloth when prepped with enough flour. It may be worthwhile having a backup stockinette change if it gets wet. It is not so easy to change the pastry board cover. Don\u2019t skimp on flour for rolling, nor do you want to use too much, as you will then end up with burned flour on your griddle rquiring dusting flour off the lefse with a pastry brush.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>7. Transfer<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>When transferring lefse to the grill be sure to move quickly for a nice even cook. Using a lefse turning stick, slide the stick under the middle of the lefse sheet making sure to keep the tip of the stick down. Lift from the middle slowly<em> and gently and transfer to the lefse grill moving <\/em>quickly to match the edge of your lefse to the edge of the lefse grill. Lay the lefse down and \u201cunroll\u201d. Again move quickly in one smooth motion. If you miss the grill and part of your lefse is hanging off, let it cook for 10-15 seconds, then using a hot pad, lay it on top of the cooking portion of lefse and gently pull the lefse that is hanging off onto the grill. Another method to transfer is to flip the edge of a sheet over the stick and roll in a couple turns and then lift up, again match your lefse to the grill, lay down and unroll.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>8.<\/strong> <\/em><strong><em>Cooking<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Cook the first side 30 seconds, give or take. The surest way to know if your lefse is ready to flip is to watch for cues. Your sheet should bubble up and when you peek under the edge there should be light golden brown spots. Then run your lefse stick down the middle, lift and turn over using the same method mentioned in step 7. Cook the second side until you see the same signs. The second side will cook considerably faster than the first side as the sheet has been heated through. From there simply transfer your lefse to lefse cozies or towel (do not use towels laundered with scents). Wipe off excess flour on your lefse grill with a dry cloth between each sheet to avoid burnt flour on your sheets. Let about 10 to 12 sheets stack, cover with a cozy or towel, then set them aside to cool. If you see that your sheets have a bit too much flour, wait until cooled and dust off. When lefse is completely cooled, fold in half, then half again and store in zip-top freezer bags. They will keep in the freezer for 6 months or more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>LEFSE<\/strong>\u00a0is a traditional soft Norwegian\u00a0flatbread. It is made with riced or instant potatoes,\u00a0flour, butter, and\u00a0milk\u00a0or\u00a0cream.\u00a0It is cooked on a large, flat\u00a0griddle. Special tools are used to prepare lefse, including long wooden turning sticks and special rolling pins with deep grooves<br \/>\n<strong>Flavouring.<\/strong>\u00a0 There are many ways of flavouring lefse. The most common is adding butter to the lefse and rolling it up. In\u00a0Norway, this is known as &#8220;lefse-klenning&#8221;. Other options include adding\u00a0cinnamon\u00a0and\/or\u00a0sugar, or spreading\u00a0jelly,\u00a0lingonberries\u00a0or\u00a0gomme\u00a0on it.\u00a0Scandinavian-American\u00a0variations include rolling it with a thin layer of\u00a0peanut butter\u00a0and sugar, with\u00a0butter\u00a0and\u00a0white\u00a0or\u00a0brown sugar, with\u00a0butter\u00a0and\u00a0corn syrup, or with\u00a0ham and eggs. Also eaten with\u00a0beef\u00a0and other savoury items like\u00a0Ribberull\u00a0and\u00a0mustard, it is comparable to a\u00a0tortilla. Lefse is a traditional accompaniment to\u00a0lutefisk, and the fish is often rolled up in the lefse.<\/p>\n<p><strong>LEFSE IN NORWAY<br \/>\nVariations.\u00a0<\/strong>There are significant regional variations in Norway in the way lefse is made and eaten, but it generally resembles a flatbread, although in many parts of Norway, especially Valdres, it is far thinner.<br \/>\n<strong>Tynnlefse<\/strong>\u00a0(thin lefse) is a variation made in central\u00a0Norway. Tynnlefse is rolled up with\u00a0butter,\u00a0sugar\u00a0and\u00a0cinnamon\u00a0(or with butter and brown sugar).<br \/>\n<strong>Tjukklefse<\/strong>\u00a0or\u00a0<strong>tykklefse<\/strong>\u00a0is thicker and often served with\u00a0coffee\u00a0as a cake.<br \/>\n<strong>Potetlefse<\/strong>\u00a0(potato lefse) is similar to and used as tynnlefse, but made with potatoes.<br \/>\n<strong>Potetkake<\/strong>\u00a0or Lompe being the &#8220;smaller-cousin&#8221; of the potato lefse, is often used in place of a\u00a0hot-dog\u00a0bun and can be used to roll up\u00a0sausages. This is also known as\u00a0<em>p\u00f8lse med lompe<\/em>\u00a0in\u00a0Norway.<br \/>\n<strong>M\u00f8sbr\u00f8mlefse<\/strong>\u00a0is a variation common to\u00a0Salten\u00a0district in\u00a0Nordland\u00a0in North Norway. M\u00f8sbr\u00f8mmen consists of half water and half the cheese smooth with flour or corn flour to a half thick sauce that greased the cooled lefse. Lefse is ready when m\u00f8sbr\u00f8mmen is warm and the butter is melted.<br \/>\n<strong>Nordlandslefse<\/strong>\u00a0is a chunky small lefse. Made of butter, syrup, sugar, eggs and flour. Originally created in western Norway as a treat to fishermen who were on the Lofoten Fishery.<br \/>\n<strong>Anislefse<\/strong>\u00a0is made on the coast of Hordaland. It resembles thin lefse but is slightly thicker, and it is stained by large amounts of whole aniseed.<br \/>\n<strong>Hardangerlefse<\/strong> is made from yeast-risen\u00a0Graham flour\u00a0or a fine ground\u00a0whole wheat flour\u00a0(krotekake). Additionally, it is often made with egg yolks and buttermilk instead of potatoes.\u00a0The dough is rolled with a conventional rolling pin (and much more flour) until it is thin and does not stick to the surface. It is then cut with a grooved rolling pin in perpendicular directions, cutting a grid into the dough which prevents it from creating air pockets as it cooks. The grid cut can also aid in thinner rolling of the lefse, as the ridges help preserve structural integrity. The lefse is cooked at high temperature (400\u00a0\u00b0F or 205\u00a0\u00b0C) until browned, and then left to dry. It can also be freeze dried by repeatedly freezing and thawing.<br \/>\n<em>Dried Hardangerlefse<\/em> can be stored without refrigeration for six months or more, so long as it is kept dry. It is customarily thought that the bread (along with\u00a0solefisk) was a staple on the seagoing voyages as far back as\u00a0Viking times. The wet lefse is dipped in water, and then placed within a towel which has also been dipped in water and wrung out. Many people maintain that dipping in salted or seawater enhances the flavour. The dry lefse regains its bread-like texture in about 60 minutes. Often that time is used to prepare such ingredients as eggs or herring which are wrapped in the lefse once it has softened.<\/p>\n<p><strong>LEFSE IN THE USA &amp; CANADA<\/strong><br \/>\nLefse is a Scandinavian treat that is especially popular around the Christmas holidays.\u00a0Many\u00a0Scandinavian-Americans\u00a0eat lefse primarily around\u00a0Thanksgiving\u00a0and\u00a0Christmas.<br \/>\nWhile the Midwest generally always makes its lefse with potatoes, this is not necessarily the case in Norway. When one uses the term \u201clefse\u201d in the United States, it more than often refers to what Norwegians call potato lefse. Norwegians, however, also make Hardanger lefse with egg yolks and buttermilk.\u00a0The tradition of making lefse was brought over by\u00a0Norwegian Americans, and potato lefse itself was made when their potato crop was successful.\u00a0Due to this, it became more prevalently made than other types in the United States. When lefse was able to be made, it was stored in small storage buildings called bryggehaus.<br \/>\nWhen Norwegian immigrants first arrived in America, they did not have the usual foods they were used to back home, including milk and porridge, dried meat, and lefse,\u00a0but early Norwegian-American immigrants brought folded lefse to eat for the beginning stages of their immigration journey via ship.\u00a0After these were eaten, the lack of food they were used to is likely why they turned back to tradition so quickly.\u00a0During\u00a0World War I, Americans were encouraged to eat potatoes to be patriotic, as the front lines needed the wheat grown at home. Lefse, a staple for Norwegian Americans, was eaten with gusto during this time. While lefse is generally not eaten with day-to-day meals in Norway today, Norwegian Americans traditionally give prominence to having lefse with their supper, considering it their specialty. Furthermore, that some Norwegian Americans still make lefse has been considered by some ethnic Norwegians to be unstylish, as it has fallen so out of tradition to hand-make the dish.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Keeping the Tradition Alive<br \/>\n<\/strong>Family members often gather to cook lefse as a group effort because the process is more enjoyable as a traditional holiday activity. This gathering also provides training to younger generations keeping the tradition alive.<br \/>\nAs the skills and patience to make lefse have been passed down less into the modern generation, the rounds have gotten thicker and smaller, whereas an ideal lefse is thin and large.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Sons of Norway have lodges to teach making lefse to younger generations. One of these lodges, in\u00a0Vancouver, Washington, uses up to sixty pounds of potatoes to make lefse every month.\u00a0While Lefse used to be eaten as a snack food, it is now more often made in large quantities for such lutefisk dinners.<br \/>\nSome professional lefse makers can roll eighty-five to 100 lefse per hour, or even up to 140.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where Lefse is Found<br \/>\n<\/strong>In Norway today, most families tend to purchase their lefse rather than making it. While today\u2019s Norwegian Americans consider making lefse at Christmas a tradition, more families are turning to purchase it from the store instead. For example, around $80,000 worth of lefse is generally sold around Christmas from Ingebretsen\u2019s Scandinavian Gifts in Minneapolis, Minnesota, yearly. Lefse can also be found in many grocery stores around Midwestern states,\u00a0including\u00a0Minnesota,\u00a0North Dakota,\u00a0South Dakota,\u00a0Iowa,\u00a0Wisconsin,\u00a0Oregon,\u00a0Alaska\u00a0and\u00a0Washington. Norsland Lefse, a factory in\u00a0Rushford, Minnesota, produces about a half million rounds of lefse each year.\u00a0The foodway of Scandinavian lefse stretches from the Midwest all the way through northeastern\u00a0Montana. Small lefse factories dot the landscape throughout this area, mostly in Norwegian communities. In the larger of these communities, Lefse can be found in grocery stores year round. In the Red River Valley specifically, \u201crestaurants, supermarkets, and clubs all serve fish, lefse, and other specialties.&#8221; Additionally, many United States Scandinavian festivals have booths to sell lefse,\u00a0and lefse can also be ordered directly from online.<br \/>\n<strong>Celebrations and Festivals<br \/>\n<\/strong>Lefse is celebrated in cities and towns with large Scandinavian populations.\u00a0Fargo, North Dakota, hosts the popular Lutefisk and Lefse Festival in August each year.\u00a0Fosston, Minnesota, invites area lefse makers to compete for the title of Champion Lefse Maker at its Lefse Fest in November.\u00a0Mankato, Minnesota, natives celebrate lefse day, a day for cooking lefse, on the Sunday after Thanksgiving.\u00a0The Potato Days festival has been taking place in Barnesville, Minnesota, since the early 1930s; this festival also takes part in the National Lefse Cookoff.<br \/>\n<strong>Rumours and Jokes<br \/>\n<\/strong>Rumours surrounding the initial use of lefse are claims by Norwegian Americans that it was made by and used to sustain the\u00a0Vikings, but potatoes were not introduced into Norway until long after the Vikings\u2019 time.\u00a0Although many Scandinavian-Americans do enjoy and eat the foods of their ethnic traditions, there is no shortage of tall-tales and jokes surrounding certain food, as well. Lefse was not excluded from these rumours. Lefse has been said to be \u201cso tasteless that many mistakenly eat the paper doily under the stack and do not know the difference.\u201d<br \/>\n<strong>Integrating Lefse into Other Foodways<br \/>\n<\/strong>Sometimes Norwegian foods are integrated into other ethnic foodways. For example, one may use lefse in order to make\u00a0enchiladas, rather than tortillas.\u00a0Additionally, American lefse is sometimes served with butter, cinnamon sugar, brown sugar, or\u00a0lingonberry jelly\u00a0before being rolled, to be eaten in a similar fashion to a\u00a0cr\u00eape. One may also choose eggs, sausage, and cheese to make it into a breakfast burrito.\u00a0One may also roll Sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d into their lefse.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>LEFSE\u00a0is a traditional soft Norwegian\u00a0flatbread.
