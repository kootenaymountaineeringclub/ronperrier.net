These things may have existed when the park was formed in 1973, but when I was last there in about 2000, none of that existed. The ability to use a map and compass (now GPS) was mandatory, just to access the park. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The honest truth about St Mary\u2019s is that, despite Alpine being in its name, \u2154 is forested, peaks are few and mediocre and views are average. The attraction is in the doing \u2013 exploring a seldom-visited wilderness, solitude, and the challenge of actually walking across the middle of it. Why would you want to drive all this way to hike undeveloped trails to so-so mountains if the goal was not a traverse? <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Once there, be prepared for rugged hiking. 100-foot contour lines do not show the series of 20-foot cliffs encountered in a traverse. Boulders the size of houses, granite slopes and huge blocks of broken rock make up much of the interior. This all makes for scrambling over, under, down and up very broken terrain. Snowstorms and white-outs complicate route finding. Be prepared to be tested. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Although there is a high risk of snow and cold weather, an ideal time for this hike might be in the middle of September. The park is covered in alpine larch that probably has all turned gold by the middle of the month. Most of the undergrowth will have died back after several frosts. Pick a good weather window and this difficult hike could become a possibility. Plan for a four or more-day backpacking trip to see most of this park. It is a long drive from almost anywhere just to get to the access points. Getting to a good place to camp in the subalpine would take a full day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Traverses of Mt St Mary\u2019s PP.<\/strong> <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A shuttle vehicle is required.
