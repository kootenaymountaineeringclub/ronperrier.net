It\u2019s bereft of almost every resource long thought to be necessary for large-scale agriculture. Yet it\u2019s the globe\u2019s number two exporter of food as measured by value, second only to the United States, which has 270 times its landmass. How on Earth have the Dutch done it?<\/p>\n<p>Seen from the air, the Netherlands resembles no other major food producer\u2014a fragmented patchwork of intensely cultivated fields, most of them tiny by agribusiness standards, punctuated by bustling cities and suburbs. In the country\u2019s principal farming regions, there\u2019s almost no potato patch, no greenhouse, no hog barn that\u2019s out of sight of skyscrapers, manufacturing plants, or urban sprawl. More than half the nation\u2019s land area is used for agriculture and horticulture.<\/p>\n<p>Banks of what appear to be gargantuan mirrors stretch across the countryside, glinting when the sun shines and glowing with eerie interior light when night falls. They are Holland\u2019s extraordinary greenhouse complexes, some of them covering 175 acres.<\/p>\n<p>These climate-controlled farms enable a country located a scant thousand miles from the Arctic Circle to be a global leader in exports of a fair-weather fruit: the tomato. The Dutch are also the world\u2019s top exporter of potatoes and onions and the second largest exporter of vegetables overall in terms of value.

If massive increases in agricultural yield are not achieved, matched by massive decreases in the use of water and fossil fuels, a billion or more people may face starvation. Hunger could be the 21st century\u2019s most urgent problem, and the visionaries working in Food Valley believe they have found innovative solutions. The wherewithal to stave off catastrophic famine is within reach, van den Ende insists. His optimism rests on feedback from more than a thousand WUR projects in more than 140 countries and on its formal pacts with governments and universities on six continents to share advances and implement them.<\/p>\n<p>A conversation with van den Ende is a white-knuckle ride on a torrent of brainstorms, statistics, and predictions. African drought? \u201cWater isn\u2019t the fundamental problem. It\u2019s poor soil,\u201d he says. \u201cThe absence of nutrients can be offset by cultivating plants that act in symbiosis with certain bacteria to produce their own fertilizer.\u201d The soaring cost of grain to feed animals? \u201cFeed them grasshoppers instead,\u201d he says. One hectare of land yields one metric ton of soy protein, a common livestock feed, a year. The same amount of land can produce 150 tons of insect protein.<\/p>\n<p>The conversation rushes on to the use of LED lighting to permit 24-hour cultivation in precisely climate-controlled greenhouses. It then detours to a misconception that sustainable agriculture means minimal human intervention in nature.<br \/>\n\u201cLook at the island of Bali!\u201d he exclaims. For at least a thousand years, its farmers have raised ducks and fish within the same flooded paddies where rice is cultivated. It\u2019s an entirely self-contained food system, irrigated by intricate canal systems along mountain terraces sculpted by human hands. \u201cThere\u2019s your model of sustainability,\u201d van den Ende says.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--below-paragraph InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\" data-bumper-index=\"9\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/a3731758-56da-4a69-afd9-c085308e6116\/hunger-solution-cows.jpg?w=2303.9999389648438&amp;h=1537.1999592781067\" alt=\"cows on a a circular merry-go-round while being milked\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">A rotary milking machine enables one operator to milk up to 150 cows an hour at Wageningen University\u2019s Dairy Campus, where researchers seek to address the challenges posed by dairy farming in the densely populated Netherlands.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\" data-bumper-index=\"11\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/1d8d2968-7962-4f62-9b26-5ebe89f43700\/hunger-solution-urban-farmer.jpg?w=2303.9999389648438&amp;h=1727.9999542236328\" alt=\"a shirtless man walking between rows of tall tomato plants in a greenhouse\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">Tomato plants fertilized with fish waste grow taller than urban farmer Paul Jeannet in this rooftop greenhouse located in a former factory in the heart of The Hague.

When a physician declared him allergic to pesticides, Koppert set out to learn all he could about the natural enemies of insects and arachnids.<\/p>\n<p>Today Koppert Biological Systems is the global pacesetter in biological pest and disease control, with 1,330 employees and 26 international subsidiaries marketing its products in 96 countries. Koppert\u2019s firm can provide you with cotton bags of ladybug larvae that mature into voracious consumers of aphids. Or how about a bottle containing 2,000 of those predatory mites that hunt down spider mites on plants and suck them dry? Or a box of 500 million nematodes that mount deadly assaults on fly larvae that prey on commercial mushrooms?<\/p>\n<p>Koppert\u2019s legions make love as well as war, in the guise of enthusiastic bumblebees. No form of artificial pollination matches the efficiency of bees buzzing from flower to flower, gathering nectar to nourish their queen and helping to fertilize the ovaries of plants along the way. Each Koppert hive accounts for daily visits to half a million flowers. Farmers using the bees typically report 20 to 30 percent increases in yields and fruit weight, for less than half the cost of artificial pollination.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--below-paragraph InlineElement--browser-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\" data-bumper-index=\"19\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/680a2120-64f2-4d1f-bcdd-8a1a74b0d0f3\/hunger-solution-students-crop.jpg?w=2591.999931335449&amp;h=2113.1999440193176\" alt=\"students in white lab coats examining plants\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\">\n<p>Knowledge is the Netherlands\u2019 most valuable export, say instructors and students at WUR, where half of all graduate students hail from other countries\u2014some threatened by recurring famine.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"EmbedInline\">\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop\" aria-label=\"markup\" data-bumper-index=\"21\">\n<div class=\"static--markup\">\n<div id=\"ngm-hungersolution-map\" class=\"ngm-hungersolution-map\">\n<div id=\"g-ngm-hungersolution-map_ai2html-box\" class=\"ai2html\">\n<div id=\"g-ngm-hungersolution-map_ai2html-desktop-medium\" class=\"g-artboard g-artboard-v3 \" data-min-width=\"1020\">\n<div id=\"g-ngm-hungersolution-map_ai2html-desktop-medium-graphic\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"g-ai1-0\" class=\"g-aiImg\" src=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/interactive-assets\/nggraphics\/ngm-hunger-solution-map\/build-2017-08-30_22-53-42\/ngm-assets\/img\/ngm-hungersolution-map_ai2html-desktop-medium.jpg\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/interactive-assets\/nggraphics\/ngm-hunger-solution-map\/build-2017-08-30_22-53-42\/ngm-assets\/img\/ngm-hungersolution-map_ai2html-desktop-medium.jpg\" data-height-multiplier=\"1.0706\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"g-ai1-1\" class=\"g-TEXT g-aiAbs\">\n<p class=\"g-aiPstyle0\">Spreading the word, feeding the world Wageningen University &amp; Research, nestled in Food Valley\u2014the Dutch agro-tech version of Silicon Valley\u2014is key to the Netherlands\u2019 agricultural success.

Yet they market no GMO products. A new seed variety in Europe\u2019s heavily regulated GMO arena can cost a hundred million dollars and require 12 to 14 years of research and development, according to KeyGene\u2019s Arjen van Tunen. By contrast, the latest achievements in the venerable science of molecular breeding\u2014which introduces no foreign genes\u2014can deliver remarkable gains in five to 10 years, with development costs as low as $100,000 and seldom more than a million dollars. It is a direct descendant of methods employed by farmers in the Fertile Crescent 10,000 years ago.<\/p>\n<p>The sales catalog of Rijk Zwaan, another Dutch breeder, offers high-yield seeds in more than 25 broad groups of vegetables, many that defend themselves naturally against major pests. Heleen Bos is responsible for the company\u2019s organic accounts and international development projects. She might be expected to dwell on the fact that a single high-tech Rijk Zwaan greenhouse tomato seed, priced below $0.50, has been known to produce a mind-boggling 150 pounds of tomatoes.

Decades later, WUR\u2019s Rudy Rabbinge, professor emeritus of sustainable development and food security, took up the cause when he helped devise extensive changes in the faculty, student body, and curriculum that transformed the institution into what he calls \u201ca university for the world, and not simply for the Dutch.\u201d Today a hefty share of the academic and research activities at WUR are focused on problems facing poor nations.<\/p>\n<p>Some 45 percent of its graduate students\u2014including nearly two-thirds of all Ph.D. candidates\u2014are recruited abroad, representing more than a hundred nations.
