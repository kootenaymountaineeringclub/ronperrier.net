Dec 2012.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Regarded as one of the holiest of the 51 Shakti Peeths on Earth, the Kalighat Kali Temple is a must-visit place in Kolkata due to its history and legend. The temple is dedicated to the Hindu Goddess Kali and is located on the banks of Adi Ganga, a small canal that connects to the Hooghly River. The present temple building was built in 1809.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The idol of the Goddess Kali, featuring three big eyes, four hands and a long protruding tongue, is made of sandstone. The tongue and the eyes of the idol are made of gold.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEj515DJXzU_GWiRsJd4tqo77MF9J0STVJVDCiOjFuSn4GaW3tBliriLgrWgYGvEgrFSk996OQMAuRyWqUKjM2-dg2ZYW6YngOy1u9cGlOybW7OmGl9dr0kSeNY6ML6C33eo2j8rXBoKG9Q\/s1600\/kalighat-kali-temple-kolkata-india.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEj515DJXzU_GWiRsJd4tqo77MF9J0STVJVDCiOjFuSn4GaW3tBliriLgrWgYGvEgrFSk996OQMAuRyWqUKjM2-dg2ZYW6YngOy1u9cGlOybW7OmGl9dr0kSeNY6ML6C33eo2j8rXBoKG9Q\/s320\/kalighat-kali-temple-kolkata-india.jpg\" width=\"423\" height=\"469\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The idol does not resemble the usual idols of the Goddess as it holds a scimitar, signifying the divine knowledge and a severed head of the demon king, Shumbha signifying the human ego slayed by the divine knowledge and removed from our behaviours. That is how one can attain moksha.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It is said that Shiva carried Sati\u2019s burnt body while performing Tandav and various parts of the Goddess\u2019s body fell on earth. The right toe of Sati fell at Kalighat and that\u2019s where the temple was built. The presiding deity was Kalika, after whom, the city was named Kolkata.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Harkath Tala<\/strong> is located adjacent to Natmandir. There are two wooden bali-peeths for carrying out the bali or animal sacrifices. The bigger one is used for sacrificing bigger animals like buffaloes whereas, the smaller one for smaller animals like goats. The animals are sacrificed with a single stroke.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A tout took me first to the room where two young goats are slaughtered daily. The tout showing me around suggested a $50 donation for the poor which I\u2019m sure is pocketed. When dealing with these guys always have some small change in your pocket and say that is all you have. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Pilgrims filed through smashing a coconut on the floor and drizzling the milk over the sacrificial site. The goat was restrained by grabbing both front legs and swinging them around the animal&#8217;s back causing the head to be held straight out. It is then placed in a U-shaped device and a bar is placed behind its head. A guy with a big sword then chops off its head. Wow. There was blood everywhere. A jostling pilgrim queue snakes into the main hall to fling hibiscus flowers at a crowned, black-faced three-eyed Kali image.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>TIRUPATHI <\/strong>Tamil Nadu December 2012. Tirupathi is the busiest temple in the world. Forty million Hindus visit every year.<br \/>\nArriving after 13 hours on the train at 7:30 am, I caught a bus one hour up the 17 km, switchbacking road to the top of the mountain and Tirupathi. Leaving my pack in luggage storage, I joined the darshan (fee) line for 300 rupees (~$6). I think they took pity on me. The people I joined had already been in line for two hours but didn\u2019t mind me budding in. Feeling lucky with my great break, I was optimistic it would not be long. The free line was across a small lake in a cage of their own. Their route was longer than ours. It will take them twelve hours to reach the temple.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.culturalindia.net\/indian-temples\/tirupati-balaji.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwjc-LXHmK3fAhVriVQKHdajDcwQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/www.culturalindia.net\/iliimages\/Tirupati-Temple-ili-396-img-4.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for tirupathi temple\" width=\"630\" height=\"337\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.culturalindia.net\/iliimages\/Tirupati-Temple-ili-396-img-4.jpg\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br \/>\nThe Hindu religion has a pantheon of 33 million gods, one of which is Vishnu. <strong>Lord Venkateswara<\/strong> is believed by followers to be a very merciful form of Vishnu, being the fulfiller of every wish made to him by the devotees. This is important, as Hindu gods are viewed as being easily bribable. 1,500 years ago, the queen donated the 18-inch silver idol of Venkateswara to this sacred shrine. This idol is believed to be self-manifested, as there is no known sculptor possessing the capability to sculpt idols of god so proportionately. In addition, no human being is known to have installed it in the shrine. Over the centuries, coronations were held in the temple and it received many gifts of gold and jewels. It is now the second richest temple in the world (number one is in Kerala, India). Indians take their religion pretty seriously.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br \/>\nMany devotees have their head tonsured as an offering to God during their pilgrimage. The daily amount of hair collected is over a ton. The hair gathered is sold by the temple organization a few times a year by public auction to international buyers for use as hair extensions and in cosmetics, bringing over $6 million to the temple\u2019s treasury. This is the second-highest income-generating activity in the temple.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br \/>\nThe line soon entered \u2018the cage\u2019, a six-foot wide tiled sidewalk enclosed with iron bars and chain link fence that snakes through the town. With a solid metal roof and a crush of people, there is no escape.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Luckily bathrooms and emergency exits were occasionally accessible. A snack stand would have made a killing. I had one opportunity to buy some biscuits through the chain link fence. Snapping them up, I offered to share with everyone around me. They looked at me in very odd ways. Virtually no one accepted.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I was in physical contact with at least two others at all times. Many were shaven bald and kept feeling their head to remind themselves what they had done.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Travelling only about one kilometre, you can imagine how slow this was moving. The line once stood still for over 30 minutes. Amazingly, some families had small children. I talked to 3 young guys from Bangalore for a while but otherwise interacted with no one. None showed any interest in me and I don\u2019t speak Hindi. This was not a relaxing time.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br \/>\nAfter five hours, it looked like we were getting close when we entered a building for the obligatory security check. Security checks are a fact of life in India. There is always a metal detector, but these are universally ignored. Baggage is passed through X-ray and everyone gets a thorough frisk. Two lines for everything \u2013 one for men, one for women. Cameras are confiscated. I was told at this point that I could not go in as I was wearing shorts. Upset, I pulled them down to cover my knees and they let me continue.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">We then entered one of three large rooms and waited for an hour. Somebody stood up to go to the bathroom and the crowd stampeded for the exit producing a crush of people at the narrow door.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">We then entered 4 connected rooms, each about 10&#215;60 feet with a small doorway at each end. You can imagine what happened at the door. I was in contact with at least six others in the squeeze.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">That led into a stairwell divided by a chain link fence to merge with the two-hour line. These people had booked at least one month previously for 50 rupees. I was jealous.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Then into another \u2018cage\u2019 and finally, after 7 fatiguing hours of shuffling along, we joined the free line inside the temple. Everybody was getting pretty excited.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Wonderfully carved stone pillars and gold shrines were passed. As we approached the shrine to the powerful Lord Venkateshwara, Priests shoved us along and I had about three seconds to view a tiny stick figure down a dimly lit 30-foot-long corridor!!!. Pushed away from the \u201cview\u201d, I joined other lines to other shrines, one to his mother and another frenzied line where priests held a silver cup to the top of the pilgrim\u2019s head. Our reward was a cookie ball.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Outside was a big crowd relaxing after the ordeal. Everyone admired the gilded gold roof of the temple.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Open 22 hours\/day, an average of 60,000 pilgrims come daily. But this was December 27 and most of India was on holiday. 200,000 blissed-out folks saw him on my day. I can\u2019t imagine it when 500,000 visit. I guess it was worth it \u2013 certainly, it was amazing to see so many devoted people never complaining. Not surprisingly, I was the only Westerner I saw. Temple staff number 12,000 and the town has hundreds of apartment buildings.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Disorientated by the wandering route of the cage and intermediary buildings, I got lost trying to find my pack, but made it down to Tirumala by 6:30. Then I had a four-hour bus to Chennai (formally called Madras, pop 10 million,), the fourth largest city in India and, the capital of Tamil Nadu. I had only a small glass of chai and the biscuits I bought through the chain link fence to eat all day. It was late, I could only find a grungy room and stayed awake most of the night with mosquitoes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>SRI PADMANABHASWAMY TEMPLE,\u00a0<\/strong> Trivandrum (900,000), the capital of Kerala.

C, D, E, and F, are in the custody of the temple priests. and are opened at least eight times every year, some of the contents stored in them are routinely taken out for use on special ceremonial occasions.

Delwara is a not-to-be-missed Jain temple.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Dilwara temples consist of 5 temples of the same size and all are single-storied. 48 pillars in all the temples have the beautiful status of females in different dancing gestures. The main attraction of this temple is \u2018Rang Mandapa\u2019 which is in the dome-shaped ceiling. It has a chandelier-like structure in the middle of the roof, and the 16 idols of \u2018Vidya Devi\u2019, the goddess of knowledge, are made of stone surrounding it. The other designs of carvings include Lotus, gods, and abstract patterns, all of these ceilings, doorways, pillars, and panels have minutely carved ornamental details which shows its unique architecture. At that time there was no transportation system for such huge blocks of marble at 1200 meters in height. Elephants were used to transport white marble on their backs from Arasuri hills at Ambaji to Mount Abu.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It was built between 400 and 1000 years ago. With the best carving, all in marble, in India, the artisans were paid by the amount of dust they collected, encouraging them to carve ever more intricately. It is impossible to figure out how the carving was done without power tools \u2013 a Dremel would have been a great help here. Two of the five temples have dizzyingly intense carvings. Vimal Vasahi was started in 1031 and took 1500 masons and 1200 labourers 14 years to build.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Outside is the House of Elephants, featuring a procession of marble elephants that carried the marble to the site.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/mapio.net\/pic\/p-11173169\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwiKyLbA1K7fAhUKl1QKHTCfB4YQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/mapio.net\/images-p\/11173169.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Luna Vasahi Temple\" width=\"633\" height=\"424\" data-src=\"https:\/\/mapio.net\/images-p\/11173169.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br \/>\nInside, a forest of beautifully carved pillars surrounds the central shrine to Adinath, the main Jain god.

They believe that liberation can be attained by achieving complete purity of the soul. Purity means shedding all matter generated by one\u2019s actions that binds itself to the soul by primarily fasting, meditation, and right conduct. Fundamental to this is nonviolence in thought and deed towards any living thing. Monks are severely ascetic but the \u2018normal\u2019 Jain maintain a minimum of possessions which include a broom to sweep a path before them to avoid stepping on any living creature, and a cloth tied over their mouth to prevent the accidental inhalation of insects. They are strict lacto-ovo-vegetarians and do not even eat root vegetables as pulling them from the ground risks killing insects. Most Jains live in Gujarat and Mumbai and Jainism only comprises about .4% of the population. This seems small compared to their cultural influence as Jain temples are the most beautiful, especially at Mt Abu in Rajasthan. Jains don\u2019t allow menstruating women to enter their temples.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a class=\"gdlr-core-lightgallery gdlr-core-js \" href=\"https:\/\/www.vidhyadeepuni.ac.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/4-2.jpg\" data-lightbox-group=\"gdlr-core-img-group-1\" data-lg-id=\"e22d6105-082b-4d81-8835-c454b7f48d6d\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/www.vidhyadeepuni.ac.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/4-2-768x480.jpg\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 767px) 100vw, (max-width: 1150px) 100vw, 1150px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.vidhyadeepuni.ac.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/4-2-400x250.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.vidhyadeepuni.ac.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/4-2-600x375.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.vidhyadeepuni.ac.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/4-2-768x480.jpg 768w\" alt=\"\" width=\"634\" height=\"396\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/www.vidhyadeepuni.ac.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/4-2-400x250.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.vidhyadeepuni.ac.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/4-2-600x375.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.vidhyadeepuni.ac.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/4-2-768x480.jpg 768w\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.vidhyadeepuni.ac.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/4-2-768x480.jpg\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw, (max-width: 1150px) 100vw, 1150px\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The tour continued to <strong>Ranakpur<\/strong>, one of India&#8217;s biggest and most important Jain temple complexes.

Extraordinary even by Hindu standards, the mass of holy rodents running around the temple is not for the squeamish. It\u2019s considered auspicious to have one run across your feet and sighting one of the white rats (I did) also augurs well for your spiritual progress.

The cow is the top dog, with snakes, monkeys and rats next and dogs at the bottom of the heap. To be reincarnated as a dog is the worst. Despite all this holy reverence, it seems that they abuse animals. People who can\u2019t afford to feed their animals let them run loose and that is why garbage is a mainstay of food for cattle, goats, and dogs.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Outside of Bikaner, next to a normal garbage dump, hundreds of dead cows, most from intestinal obstructions from eating plastic, were deposited.

Dying here relieves one from continuing on the circle of life.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Old Town is a labyrinth of narrow allies too narrow for traffic. My hotel (Ganpati Guesthouse), is situated right above the river on Meer Ghat.<br \/>\nVaranasi sits on the west bank of a wide sweep of the Ganges, and ghats (stairs that end in the river) cover the entire shoreline. The ghats are covered in water during the monsoon and huge piles of sand remain to be cleaned off some of the stairs. Boats in the river have big diesel pumps to wash off the sand. At this time of the year, walk along the ghats and the unravelling spectacle that Varanasi is famous for. Festivals seem continuous in Varanasi and <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">are held on the ghats. T<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">here are 412 festivals in India every day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Many come here to bathe in the early morning for sunrise, to wash away the sins of a lifetime in the sacred, incredibly polluted water. People wash their clothes in it and despite the water, the clothes look clean. Most famously, they come to be cremated here. Dying in Varanasi offers \u2018moksha\u2019 or liberation from the cycle of birth and death, making the city the beating heart of the Hindu universe. It is a unique place and walking along the ghats will live long in your memory.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The only things not eligible for cremation are animals, people who are already pure (pregnant women, children under 10, and sadhus), people who have died from leprosy or smallpox (to avoid releasing the germs) and people killed by snakebite (snakes are holy). These are taken to the middle of the river, weighed down with stones and sunk. For the rest, cremation cleans their sins and their spirits are released into the air to go to heaven. There are two ghats where all the cremations take place and I watched the process for several hours at Manikarnika, the largest of the two.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tripadvisor.co.uk\/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g297685-d7268147-i168560794-Streetwise_Varanasi_Tours_Day_Tours-Varanasi_Varanasi_District_Uttar_Pra.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwiFmPLAlrHfAhWirVQKHZSsBNwQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-s\/0a\/0c\/08\/9a\/manikarnika-ghat.jpg\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"633\" height=\"421\" data-src=\"https:\/\/media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-s\/0a\/0c\/08\/9a\/manikarnika-ghat.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/cohn17.com\/2011\/02\/02\/16-21-january-2011-manikarnika-ghat\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwiZ2O79lrHfAhWMFXwKHeFRCCsQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/cohn17.files.wordpress.com\/2011\/02\/20110119_varanasi_212.jpg\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"633\" height=\"436\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cohn17.files.wordpress.com\/2011\/02\/20110119_varanasi_212.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The body is brought down to the river on bamboo stretchers, washed in the river and covered in a white cover by the family. Women are not allowed to partake in the process as they often throw themselves on the fire in remorse. The exact amount of wood is calculated and paid for (200 rupees per kg for sandalwood and 150 for banyan, about 200 kg is used in an average cremation) and a pyre is constructed from the huge piles of logs surrounding the ghat. Sandalwood powder is used to control the smell. Ghee and loose brush are used to fuel the initial fire. Fire is obtained with a big sheaf of grass from a fire burning continuously for 3500 years at this ghat. The head is crushed about 2 hours into the burn to release the spirits. The entire process takes about 3 hours. The ashes are collected and dumped into the river. Photographs are prohibited.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A pack of dogs and cows roam the ghat, a garbage dump for all the discarded clothing, stretchers, and typical garbage on the shore of the sacred river. 7 big boats filled with wood ready for unloading were on shore. The water is full of sightseers in rowboats viewing the spectacle. Many touts saunter up to you and begin to give all the above info. Even though you tell them that you donated money for wood for poor people the day before and have heard all they have to say and don\u2019t plan on giving them money today, they persist with the info. If you leave and don\u2019t pay (500 rupees or about $11 is suggested), they become incredibly aggressive, wondering why you just wasted an hour of their time. In reality, these bullies simply pocket the money.

Joining one of two lines, it was a frantic frenzy to touch the small lingam, what all the fuss was about. It was a 10\u2033 diameter stone, 12\u2033 high, with a rounded top.

The nearby Hindu temple rings a bell endlessly and blows a conch shell just before the sun rises as a red orb directly across the Ganges. A huge sandbank stretches for a few kilometres on the flood plain and a line of trees hides the town of Ramnagar. Nothing interferes with the view of the rising sun. Touts wander around the ghat selling boat rides. The river is packed with tourist row boats. Flotillas of candles in baskets with marigolds are released. The boats are one of the obligatory tourist activities but I have resisted.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">For those who want to purify themselves in the Ganges in Varanasi, here is something that might make you think twice. Only 8 of 3000 municipalities in India treat their sewage. This is an excerpt from the book <em>The Big Thirst<\/em>, about how India treats its holy rivers, specifically how Delhi disposes of its sewage.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Just north of the City of Delhi, the Yamuna River is wide and flat and peaceful, winding through undeveloped land, with a scattering of people. The river is not pristine, but it has an appealing naturalness.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Near Delhi is a low dam across the Yamuna, and just behind the dam, Delhi has a water intake to supply drinking water to the thirsty city of 20 million people. Almost no water passes beyond the dam, the Yamuna is reduced to a trickle, not even 10% of the river&#8217;s width above the dam. For perhaps 150 feet, the mighty and revered Yamuna River is little more than a creek. Then, all at once, the river\u2019s flow is restored from the west bank \u2013 a vast cataract of water comes rushing in from the mouth of a tributary that is 60 feet across, and if you close your eyes, the volume and the sound of crashing water are such that you can imagine a wilderness river.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But the smell and the colour of this tributary are astonishing. The water is India-ink black. The smell is barnyard-organic fermented with chemical plant acrid \u2013 manure and methane. Where the black tributary joins the Yamuna\u2019s riverbed, the smell is too strong to bear.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">This is one of the \u201cdrains\u201d that collect the wastewater from Delhi\u2019s residents, its hospitals, factories, and businesses, and pours it back into the Yamuna, almost a billion gallons a day. It is, in fact, a black river of raw urban sewage \u2013 this one drain puts out 1 million gallons of wastewater every four minutes. Out in the middle of the restored flow floats the carcass of a dead water buffalo; along the banks, you can easily spot every sort of debris \u2013 flowers, clothing, take-out food containers, a Bacardi rum bottle, a hypodermic needle.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Just beyond where that first canal of sewage empties into the riverbed, there is an informal beach, where people come to make sacred offerings. You can rent a boat and float out onto the black river. The smell eventually dulls the nose. The surface of the Yamuna is odd \u2013 it\u2019s flat and shiny black but pocked everywhere with tiny bubbles fizzing up, from methane bubbling up from the fermenting river.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">People at the beach wash clothes in this water, people come to take a dip in the Yamuna\u2019s sacred flow, to wash away their sins, as if anything they have done could be cleansed by water this dirty. It\u2019s not wise to even put your hand in the water. It is unimaginable, almost immeasurably, filthy.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In 2008, India\u2019s Centre for Science and Environment reported that as the Yamuna flows through Delhi, the pollution isn\u2019t just unsafe for swimming. India\u2019s standard for safe swimming is 500 bacteria per 100 millilitres (the US EPA standard is half that.) Halfway along its trip through Delhi, the coliform count was typically 10 million bacteria per 100 millilitres and often 100 million. One eyedropper of Yamuna River water is enough to make 6 bathtubs of water unsafe to sit in.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Yamuna flows for fourteen miles along the eastern side of Delhi, mostly hidden from easy public access, or even view. By the time the river leaves the city limits, twenty-two drains have emptied into it. The Yamuna just gets dirtier as it goes. The venerated Ganges River is, if conceivable dirtier, and the Yamuna is the main tributary of the Ganges, contributing 60% of its flow.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It\u2019s easy to get discouraged about water in India and the Yamuna is typical. It\u2019s hard to imagine, in a country that can compete in brain jobs with the United States, that can send science missions to the Moon and put six billionaires among the 50 richest people in the world, it\u2019s hard to believe that it treats its great rivers this way.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But Delhi was able to eliminate air that was turning into a toxic soup from pollution by legislating the conversion of all public buses, taxis, and auto-rickshaws to low-emission compressed-natural-gas fuel. The air is still gray and smoky but much cleaner than without this measure.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">One in six people in India rely on water that is transported by foot. Poor Indians don\u2019t have the power to demand improved water service.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I left Varanasi on November 28th, 36 hours into one of Varanasi\u2019s biggest festivals.\u00a0Over these four days, permanent absolution from all sins is given if one bathes in the Ganges. Four million people are expected and many were up most of the night. Up at 5, I walked down to the ghat and it was a bedlam of undressing and sudsing, a regular bathathon. Tonight at sunset will be chaos.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"entry-author-info\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>These were some special temples in India KALIGHAT KALI TEMPLE Kolkata.
