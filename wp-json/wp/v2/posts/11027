It shares\u00a0land borders\u00a0with\u00a0Montenegro to the northwest,\u00a0Kosovo\u00a0to the northeast,\u00a0North Macedonia\u00a0to the east,\u00a0Greece\u00a0to the south and a\u00a0maritime border\u00a0with\u00a0Italy\u00a0to the west.<br \/>\nGeographically, the country displays varied\u00a0climatic,\u00a0geological,\u00a0hydrological\u00a0and\u00a0morphological\u00a0conditions, defined in an area of 28,748\u00a0km2\u00a0(11,100\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). It possesses remarkable diversity with the\u00a0landscape\u00a0ranging from the snow-capped mountains in the\u00a0Albanian Alps\u00a0as well as the\u00a0Korab,\u00a0Skanderbeg,\u00a0Pindus\u00a0and\u00a0Ceraunian Mountains\u00a0to the hot and sunny coasts of the\u00a0Albanian Adriatic\u00a0and\u00a0Ionian Sea\u00a0along the Mediterranean.<br \/>\nHistorically, the area of Albania was populated by various\u00a0Illyrian,\u00a0Thracian\u00a0and\u00a0Ancient Greek\u00a0tribes as well as several\u00a0Greek colonies\u00a0established in the Illyrian coast. The area was annexed in the 3rd century by\u00a0Romans\u00a0and became an integral part of the\u00a0Roman provinces\u00a0of\u00a0Dalmatia,\u00a0Macedonia\u00a0and\u00a0Illyricum. The autonomous\u00a0Principality of Arb\u00ebr\u00a0emerged in 1190, established by\u00a0archon\u00a0Progon\u00a0in the\u00a0Kruj\u00eb, within the\u00a0Byzantine Empire. In the late thirteenth century,\u00a0Charles of Anjou\u00a0conquered Albanian territories from the Byzantines and established the medieval\u00a0Kingdom of Albania, which at its maximal extension was extending from Durr\u00ebs along the coast to\u00a0Butrint\u00a0in the south. In the mid-fifteenth century, it was conquered by the\u00a0Ottomans.<br \/>\nThe modern nation state of Albania\u00a0emerged\u00a0in 1912 following the defeat of the Ottomans in the\u00a0Balkan Wars.\u00a0The modern\u00a0Kingdom of Albania\u00a0was invaded by\u00a0Italy\u00a0in 1939, which formed\u00a0Greater Albania, before becoming a\u00a0Nazi German protectorate\u00a0in 1943.\u00a0After the defeat of Nazi Germany, a\u00a0Communist state\u00a0titled the\u00a0People&#8217;s Socialist Republic of Albania\u00a0was founded under the leadership of\u00a0Enver Hoxha\u00a0and the\u00a0Party of Labour. The country experienced widespread social and political transformations in the communist era, as well as isolation from much of the international community. In the aftermath of the\u00a0Revolutions\u00a0of 1991, the Socialist Republic was\u00a0dissolved\u00a0and the fourth Republic of Albania was established.<br \/>\nPolitically, the country is a\u00a0unitary\u00a0parliamentary\u00a0constitutional republic\u00a0and\u00a0developing country\u00a0with an upper-middle income\u00a0economy\u00a0dominated by the tertiary sector followed by the secondary and\u00a0primary\u00a0sector. It went through a process of transition, following the\u00a0end of communism\u00a0in 1990, from a\u00a0centralized\u00a0to a\u00a0market-based economy.\u00a0It also provides\u00a0universal health care\u00a0and free primary and secondary\u00a0education\u00a0to its citizens.<br \/>\nThe country is a member of the\u00a0United Nations,\u00a0World Bank,\u00a0UNESCO,\u00a0NATO,\u00a0WTO,\u00a0COE,\u00a0OSCE\u00a0and\u00a0OIC. It is also an\u00a0official candidate\u00a0for membership in the\u00a0European Union.\u00a0In addition it is one of the founding members of the\u00a0Energy Community, including the\u00a0Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation\u00a0and\u00a0Union for the Mediterranean.<\/p>\n<p>The term Albania is the\u00a0medieval Latin\u00a0name of the country. It may be derived from the\u00a0Illyrian tribe\u00a0of\u00a0Albani.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GEOGRAPHY<\/strong><br \/>\nAlbania is defined in an area of 28,748 square kilometres (11,100 square miles) and located on the\u00a0Balkan Peninsula\u00a0in\u00a0South\u00a0and\u00a0Southeast Europe.\u00a0Its coastline faces the\u00a0Adriatic Sea\u00a0to the northwest and the\u00a0Ionian Sea\u00a0to the southwest within the\u00a0Mediterranean Sea.<br \/>\nThe highest point of the country is\u00a0Mount Korab\u00a0at 2,764 metres (9,068.24\u00a0ft)\u00a0above the Adriatic. The distance from the east to west is only 148 kilometres (92\u00a0mi), while from the north to south about 340 kilometres (211\u00a0mi).<br \/>\nFor a small country, much of Albania rises into\u00a0mountains\u00a0and\u00a0hills\u00a0that run in different directions across the length and breadth of the country. The most extensive mountain ranges are the\u00a0Albanian Alps\u00a0in the north, the\u00a0Korab Mountains\u00a0in the east, the\u00a0Pindus Mountains\u00a0in the southeast, the\u00a0Ceraunian Mountains\u00a0in the southwest and the\u00a0Skanderbeg Mountains\u00a0in the center.<br \/>\nOne of the most remarkable features about the country is the presence of numerous important lakes. The\u00a0Lake of Shkod\u00ebr\u00a0is the largest lake in\u00a0Southern Europe\u00a0and located in northwest.\u00a0In the\u00a0southeast\u00a0rises the\u00a0Lake of Ohrid\u00a0that is one of the oldest continuously existing lakes in the world.\u00a0Further south extend the\u00a0Large\u00a0and\u00a0Small Lake of Prespa\u00a0that are among the highest positioned lakes in the\u00a0Balkans.<br \/>\nRivers originate mostly in the east of Albania and discharge into the Adriatic Sea in the west. The longest river in the country, measured from its mouth to its source, is probably the\u00a0Drin\u00a0that starts at the confluence of its two headwaters, the\u00a0Black\u00a0and\u00a0White Drin. Though of particular concern is the\u00a0Vjos\u00eb\u00a0that represents one of the last intact large river systems in Europe.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ECONOMY<\/strong><br \/>\nThe transition from a socialist\u00a0planned economy\u00a0to a capitalist\u00a0mixed economy\u00a0in Albania has been largely successful.\u00a0The country has a\u00a0developing\u00a0mixed economy classified by the\u00a0World Bank\u00a0as an\u00a0upper-middle income economy. In 2016, it had the 4th lowest\u00a0unemployment rate\u00a0in the\u00a0Balkans\u00a0with an estimated value of 14.7%. Its largest trading partners are Italy, Greece, China, Spain, Kosovo and the United States. The\u00a0lek\u00a0(ALL) is the country&#8217;s currency and is\u00a0pegged\u00a0at approximately 132,51 lek per euro.<br \/>\nThe cities of\u00a0Tirana\u00a0and\u00a0Durr\u00ebs\u00a0constitute the economic and financial heart of Albania due to their high population, modern infrastructure and strategic geographical location. The country&#8217;s most important infrastructure facilities take course through both of the cities, connecting the north to the south as well as the west to the east. Among the largest\u00a0companies\u00a0are the petroleum\u00a0Ta\u00e7i Oil,\u00a0Albpetrol,\u00a0ARMO\u00a0and Kastrati, the mineral\u00a0AlbChrome, the cement\u00a0Antea, the investment\u00a0BALFIN Group\u00a0and the technology\u00a0Albtelecom,\u00a0Vodafone,\u00a0Telekom Albania\u00a0and others.<br \/>\nIn 2012, Albania&#8217;s\u00a0GDP per capita\u00a0stood at 30% of the\u00a0European Union\u00a0average, while\u00a0GDP (PPP) per capita\u00a0was 35%.\u00a0Albania was one of three countries in\u00a0Europe\u00a0to record an\u00a0economic growth\u00a0in the first quarter of 2010 after the\u00a0global financial crisis. The\u00a0International Monetary Fund\u00a0predicted 2.6% growth for Albania in 2010 and 3.2% in 2011.\u00a0According to the\u00a0Forbes\u00a0as of December\u00a02016, the\u00a0Gross Domestic Product (GDP)\u00a0was growing at 2.8%. The country had a\u00a0trade balance\u00a0of \u22129.7% and\u00a0unemployment rate\u00a0of 14.7%.\u00a0The\u00a0Foreign direct investment\u00a0has increased significantly in recent years as the government has embarked on an ambitious program to improve the business climate through fiscal and legislative reforms. The economy is expected to expand in the near term, driven by a recovery in consumption and robust investments. Growth is projected to be 3.2% in 2016, 3.5% in 2017, and 3.8% in 2018.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DEMOGRAPHICS<br \/>\n<\/strong>The\u00a0population\u00a0of Albania was estimated in 2016 to be approximately 2,886,026. The country&#8217;s\u00a0total fertility rate\u00a0of 1.51 children born per woman is one of the\u00a0lowest in the world.\u00a0Its\u00a0population density\u00a0stands at 259 inhabitants per square kilometre. The overall\u00a0life expectancy\u00a0at birth is 78.5 years; 75.8 years for males and 81.4 years for females.\u00a0The country is the\u00a08th most populous country\u00a0in the\u00a0Balkans\u00a0and ranks as the\u00a0137th most populous country\u00a0in the world. The population of the country rose steadily from 2,5 million in 1979 until 1989, when it peaked at 3.1 million.\u00a0It is forecasted that the population should not reach its peak number of 1989 until 2031, depending on the actual\u00a0birth rate\u00a0and the level of\u00a0net migration. The explanation for the recent population decrease is the\u00a0fall of communism in Albania. It was marked by large economic\u00a0mass emigration from Albania to\u00a0Greece,\u00a0Italy\u00a0and the\u00a0United States. 40 years of\u00a0isolation\u00a0from the world, combined with its disastrous economic, social and political situation, had caused this exodus. The\u00a0external migration\u00a0was prohibited outright during the communist era, while\u00a0internal migration\u00a0was quite limited, hence this was a new phenomenon. At least, 900,000 people left Albania during this period, about 600,000 of them settling in Greece.\u00a0The migration affected the country&#8217;s internal population distribution. It decreased particularly in the north and south, while it increased in the center within the cities of\u00a0Tirana\u00a0and\u00a0Durr\u00ebs.\u00a0According to the\u00a0Institute of Statistics (INSTAT)\u00a0as of 1\u00a0January\u00a02015, the population of Albania is 2,893,005. About 53.4% of the country&#8217;s\u00a0population\u00a0is living in cities.<br \/>\nThe three largest counties by population account for half of the total population. Almost 30% of the total population is found in\u00a0Tirana County\u00a0followed by\u00a0Fier County\u00a0with 11% and\u00a0Durr\u00ebs County\u00a0with 10%.\u00a0Over 1 million people are concentrated in\u00a0Tirana\u00a0and\u00a0Durr\u00ebs, making it the largest urban area in Albania.\u00a0Tirana\u00a0is one of largest cities in the\u00a0Balkan Peninsula\u00a0and ranks 7th with a population about 800,000.\u00a0The second largest city in the country by population is\u00a0Durr\u00ebs, with a population of 201,110, followed by\u00a0Vlor\u00eb\u00a0with a population of 141,513.<br \/>\n<strong>Minorities<br \/>\n<\/strong>Issues of ethnicity are a delicate topic and subject to debate. Contrary to official statistics that show an over 97 per cent Albanian majority in the country, minority groups (such as\u00a0Greeks,\u00a0Macedonians,\u00a0Montenegrins,\u00a0Roma\u00a0and\u00a0Aromanians) have frequently disputed the official numbers, asserting a higher percentage of the country&#8217;s population. According to the disputed 2011 census, ethnic affiliation was as follows:\u00a0Albanians\u00a02,312,356 (82.6% of the total),\u00a0Greeks\u00a024,243 (0.9%),\u00a0Macedonians\u00a05,512 (0.2%),\u00a0Montenegrins\u00a0366 (0.01%),\u00a0Aromanians\u00a08,266 (0.30%),\u00a0Romani\u00a08,301 (0.3%),\u00a0Balkan Egyptians\u00a03,368 (0.1%), other ethnicities 2,644 (0.1%), no declared ethnicity 390,938 (14.0%), and not relevant 44,144 (1.6%). Greek,\u00a0Macedonian,\u00a0Wallachian,\u00a0Montenegrin,\u00a0Serb,\u00a0Roma,\u00a0Egyptian,\u00a0Bosnian\u00a0and\u00a0Bulgarian peoples.\u00a0Other Albanian minorities are\u00a0Gorani,\u00a0Aromanians\u00a0and\u00a0Jews.\u00a0Regarding the Greeks, &#8220;it is difficult to know how many Greeks there are in Albania&#8221;. The estimates vary between 60,000 and 300,000 ethnic Greeks in Albania. According to Ian Jeffries, most of Western sources put the number at around 200,000.<br \/>\n<strong>Languages.<br \/>\n<\/strong>Albanian\u00a0is the official language of the Republic of Albania. Its standard spoken and written form is revised and merged from the two main dialects,\u00a0Gheg\u00a0and\u00a0Tosk, though it is notably based more on the Tosk dialect. The\u00a0Shkumbin\u00a0river is the rough dividing line between the two dialects. Also a\u00a0dialect of Greek\u00a0that preserves features now lost in standard\u00a0modern Greek\u00a0is spoken in areas inhabited by the\u00a0Greek minority. Other languages spoken by ethnic minorities in Albania include\u00a0Aromanian,\u00a0Serbian,\u00a0Macedonian,\u00a0Bosnian,\u00a0Bulgarian,\u00a0Gorani, and\u00a0Roma.\u00a0Macedonian is official in the Pustec Municipality in East Albania. According to the 2011 population census, 2,765,610 or 98.767% of the population declared\u00a0Albanian\u00a0as their mother tongue.<br \/>\nGreek\u00a0is the second most-spoken language in the country, with 0.5 to 3% of the population speaking it as first language,\u00a0and with two-thirds of mainly Albanian families having at least one member that speaks Greek, most having learned it in the post communist era (1992\u2013present) due to private schools or migration to Greece.\u00a0Outside of the small designated &#8220;minority area&#8221; in the south the teaching of Greek was banned during the communist era.\u00a0As of 2003 Greek is offered at over 100 private tutoring centers all over Albania and at a private school in Tirana, the first of its kind outside Greece.<br \/>\nIn recent years, the shrinking number of pupils in schools dedicated to the Greek minority has caused problems for teachers.\u00a0The Greek language is spoken by an important percentage in the southern part of the country, due to cultural and economic links with adjacent Greece.\u00a0In a 2017 study, 39.9% of the 25\u201364 years old is able to use at least one foreign language, with English first at 40.0%, followed by Italian with 27.8% and Greek with 22.9%. Among young people aged 25 or less, English, German and Turkish have seen a rising interest after 2000. Italian and French have had a stable interest, while Greek has lost most of the interest. The trends are linked with cultural and economic factors.<br \/>\n<strong>Religion<br \/>\n<\/strong>Albania is a\u00a0secular state\u00a0without an\u00a0official religion, with the\u00a0freedom of religion\u00a0being a\u00a0constitutional\u00a0right.\u00a0The 2011 census, for the first time since 1930, included an optional open-ended question on religion; the census recorded a majority of\u00a0Muslims\u00a0(58.79%), which include Sunni (56.70%) and\u00a0Bektashi\u00a0Muslims (2.09%).\u00a0Christians, making up 16.92% of the population, including\u00a0Roman Catholics(10.03%),\u00a0Orthodox\u00a0(6.75%) and evangelical Protestants(.14%).\u00a0Atheists\u00a0accounted for 2.5% of the population and 5.49% were non-affiliated believers, while 13.79% preferred not to answer.<br \/>\nThe preliminary results of the 2011 census seemed to give widely different results, with 70% of respondents refusing to declare belief in any of the listed faiths.\u00a0The Albanian Orthodox Church officially refused to recognize the results, claiming that 24% of the total population adhered to its faith.\u00a0Some Muslim Community officials expressed unhappiness with the data claiming that many Muslims were not counted and that the number of adherents numbered some 70% of the Albanian population.\u00a0The Albanian Catholic Bishops Conference also cast doubts on the census, complaining that many of its believers were not contacted.\u00a0The\u00a0Muslim Albanians\u00a0are spread throughout the country.\u00a0Orthodox\u00a0and\u00a0Bektashis\u00a0are mostly found in the south, whereas\u00a0Catholics\u00a0mainly live in the north.\u00a0In 2008, there were 694\u00a0Catholic\u00a0churches\u00a0and 425\u00a0orthodox\u00a0churches, 568\u00a0mosques\u00a0and 70\u00a0bektashi\u00a0tekkes\u00a0in the country.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Resurrection Cathedral\u00a0of\u00a0Tirana\u00a0is the third largest Orthodox church in\u00a0Europe.\u00a0Eastern orthodoxy was first introduced during the\u00a0Roman period.<br \/>\nReligious tolerance\u00a0is one of the most important values of the tradition of the\u00a0Albanians. It is widely accepted that Albanians generally value a peaceful coexistence among the believers of different religious communities in the country.\u00a0During an\u00a0official visit\u00a0in\u00a0Tirana,\u00a0Pope Francis\u00a0hailed Albania as model of religious harmony, due to the long tradition of religious coexistence and tolerance. The country is ranked among the least religious countries in the world.\u00a0Furthermore,\u00a0religion\u00a0plays an important role in the lives of only 39% of the country&#8217;s population.\u00a0In the\u00a0WIN\/Gallup International\u00a0Report of 2016, 56% of the Albanian people considered themselves religious, 30% considered themselves non-religious, while 9% defined themselves as convinced atheists; 80% believed in God and 40% believed in life after death. However, 40% believed in hell, while 42% believed in heaven.<br \/>\nDuring\u00a0classical times, there are thought to have been about seventy Christian families in\u00a0Durr\u00ebs, as early as the time of the\u00a0Apostles. The\u00a0Archbishopric of Durr\u00ebs\u00a0was purportedly founded by\u00a0Paul the Apostle, while preaching in\u00a0Illyria\u00a0and\u00a0Epirus. Meanwhile, in\u00a0medieval times, the\u00a0Albanian people\u00a0first appeared within historical records from the\u00a0Byzantines. At this point, they were mostly\u00a0Christianized.\u00a0Islam\u00a0arrived for the first time in the late 9th century to the region, when\u00a0Arabs\u00a0raided parts of the eastern banks of the\u00a0Adriatic Sea.\u00a0It later emerged as the majority religion, during the centuries of\u00a0Ottoman Period,\u00a0though a significant Christian minority remained.<br \/>\nDuring\u00a0modern times, the Albanian republican, monarchic and later communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life. The country has never had an\u00a0official religion\u00a0either as a republic or as a kingdom.<br \/>\nIn the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy and ultimately eradicated during the 1950s and 1960s, under the state policy of obliterating all organized religion from the territories of Albania. The\u00a0communist regime\u00a0persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely\u00a0banned religion. The country was then officially declared to be the world&#8217;s first\u00a0atheist state. Although, the country&#8217;s\u00a0religious freedom\u00a0has returned, since the\u00a0end of communism.<br \/>\nIslam survived communist era persecution and reemerged in the modern era as a practiced religion in Albania.\u00a0Some smaller Christian sects in Albania include\u00a0Evangelicals\u00a0and several\u00a0Protestant\u00a0communities including\u00a0Seventh-day Adventist Church,\u00a0Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\u00a0and\u00a0Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses.\u00a0The first recorded Protestant of Albania was Said Toptani, who traveled around\u00a0Europe\u00a0and returned to\u00a0Tirana\u00a0in 1853, where he preached\u00a0Protestantism. Due to that, he was arrested and imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities in 1864. First\u00a0evangelical Protestants\u00a0appeared in the 19th century and the Evangelical Alliance was founded in 1892.
