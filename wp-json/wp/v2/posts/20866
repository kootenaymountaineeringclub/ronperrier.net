You can use this to know if your child is meeting the right developmental milestones and then discuss it with a developmental pediatrician, child psychiatrist, or clinical psychologist. Please note that this checklist is not a substitute for a professional assessment.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Assessment.\u00a0<\/strong>There is no single medical or genetic test to identify ASD. However, professionals may carry out an evaluation or assessment using diagnostic tools such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) or the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) to identify ASD.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The child will be evaluated across a range of skill development. More specifically, the assessment looks at aspects of difficulty, including social skills, friendship skills, conversational skills, pedantic speech patterns, a tendency towards ego-centrism and preoccupation in a particular area of interest, lack of emotional control, and immaturity of empathetic skills. There may be difficulty attending class and demonstrated learning deficits, along with organizational, motor, and sensory concerns. including communication, social, motor, and cognitive development.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Many children with ASD may also have other medical or psychiatric conditions, and this is referred to as comorbidity. Conditions that are commonly comorbid with autism are ADHD, anxiety, depression, sensory sensitivities, intellectual disability (ID), and Tourette\u2019s syndrome, and a differential diagnosis is done to rule them out.<\/span>There is no medical autism test, like a blood test, to diagnose autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Instead, experienced medical professionals examine a person\u2019s developmental history and behaviour, interview and observe the person and their loved ones, and use professional screening and diagnostic tools to make a diagnosis.<\/span><\/nav>\n<nav>\n<div class=\"basic-page__inner\">\n<div class=\"basic-page__content \">\n<div class=\"basic-block\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">While an autism diagnosis can only be given by a health care professional, several screening tools can alert parents, caregivers and autistic people to potential autism symptoms.

The prevalence, which has increased in recent decades, is thought to be due to better recognition of symptoms and improved screening procedures. Even so, families still face challenges, including a delayed diagnosis. For girls and\u00a0children of\u00a0minorities, this delay is often longer due to an inability to access the right experts and the variability of symptoms from child to child.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Currently, there is no medical test for autism.

These children also must be taken to more doctors\u2019 appointments and are at a higher risk of receiving inaccurate diagnoses than their peers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">In a\u00a0recent paper\u00a0published in the journal\u00a0<i>Nature Medicine<\/i>, researchers describe a digital screening device that uses machine learning to analyze various aspects of behavior to determine whether a child has a high probability of being autistic or not. When they tested this screening tool\u2014called the SenseToKnow app\u2014in a sample of 475 children, they found it had a high accuracy rate for predicting which children were eventually diagnosed as autistic.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"RxNCg PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Barriers to a timely diagnosis<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Parents are quite good at detecting if something is different about their child. But reporting those concerns to their doctors poses significant challenges, whether it&#8217;s difficulty framing the context or finding the right words to describe what they are observing.

The test predicts the high probability of being autistic based on several factors\u2014what they pay attention to in the video, what facial expressions they make, how they move their head, and how they respond to their name.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Differences in facial expressions are extremely subtle. In practical terms, for parents, reporting these subtleties can be challenging. It is very difficult for a parent to quantify and even describe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Of the 475 children who were screened with this app during a primary care visit, 49 of them were eventually diagnosed with autism, while another 98 children were diagnosed with other developmental delays. This prevalence, which is higher than average, was likely due to the opt-in nature of the study, which may have led the parents concerned about their child\u2019s development to enroll.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"RxNCg PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Sensitivity vs specificity<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">A good screening tool will reliably identify the kids who are autistic while also identifying the children who aren\u2019t. These aspects of a test\u2019s accuracy are called sensitivity and specificity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">A test\u2019s sensitivity is its ability to detect autism correctly when it is present; specificity is a test\u2019s ability to correctly detect when autism <i>isn\u2019t<\/i>\u00a0present.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">If a test has poor sensitivity but high specificity, there is a high chance that the children with a positive result will be autistic.

Although SenseToKnow\u2019s accuracy was generally quite good, these results weren\u2019t uniform among all groups of patients.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The sensitivity in Black children was great, the specificity was not great.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">This lower specificity would mean a higher chance of a child receiving a false positive result\u2014in which the test predicts that a child is autistic when they are not. Given the relatively low number of Black children enrolled in the study, this accuracy can most likely be improved with further testing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The next step is to test 5,000 or 10,000 kids at a checkup and see how it works.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>EVALUATION Screening is only to rule out the possible presence of a developmental delay, and professionals may use screening tools such as M-CHAT-R\/F to assess the risk for ASD.
