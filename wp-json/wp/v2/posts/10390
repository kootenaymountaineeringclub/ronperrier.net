The southern part of the Mount was the Silwan necropolis, attributed to the ancient Judean kingdom. The mount has been used as a Jewish cemetery for over 3,000 years and holds approximately 150,000 graves, making it central in the tradition of Jewish cemeteries. Several key events in the life of Jesus, as related in the Gospels, took place on the Mount of Olives, and in the Acts of the Apostles, it is described as the place from which Jesus ascended to heaven. Because of its association with both Jesus and Mary, the Mount has been a site of Christian worship since ancient times and is today a major site of pilgrimage for Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestants.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Much of the top of the hill is occupied by\u00a0At-Tur, also the highest point at 818\u00a0m (2,684\u00a0ft), a former village and now a neighbourhood of\u00a0East Jerusalem\u00a0with a majority-Muslim population.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">From\u00a0Biblical times\u00a0until the present,\u00a0Jews\u00a0have been buried on the Mount of Olives.
