Considered to be part of the Stockdale Group, it was first climbed by Art Maki and R.C. West as part of their JumboCreek-to-Macbeth-Icefields trek of August 1960. It may have been scaled by one or more parties from the KMC&#8217;s &#8220;Crystal Ridge&#8221; hiking camp in 1988, although it&#8217;s difficult to tell from the written accounts. Mike HYRniuk, Ray Suomi, and I traversed the peak via the E. ridge and S. face on July 17, 1995. It would fit into the category that Steve describes as &#8220;peak bagging for intermediates.&#8221; <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Once more, road access is a key. Previously, trips to &#8220;Crystal Ridge&#8221; entailed 90 min. to an hour of bushwhacking. Now there is a new 2WD spur road taking off to the NE from near the end of Glacier Creek&#8217;s north fork road. In the summer of 1995, one could drive 2 km. to a landing at 5,800&#8242; (198-852) on the S. bank of the creek draining SW from Starbird Pass.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\"> From this point, descend to the creek and walk its bed NE, with occasional detours into light timber on the N. bank, to the upper of two south-flowing streams (208-869, 6,800&#8242;). We took 1 1\/4 hours to reach this point, with no bushwhacking. Next, follow this tributary N. through open meadows and up moraines and snow slopes to a 9,000&#8242; col E. of &#8220;Mt. Gansner&#8221; (201-895). At this point, you are on the S. edge of the Starbird Glacier and could hoof it over to Birthday and Eyebrow quite comfortably. To continue for &#8220;Mt. Gansner,&#8221; head WSW on the glacier on the N. side of the peak&#8217;s NE ridge (crumbly, rotten towers). This is mostly a glacier approach with several hummocks to cross over, a traverse, passage of a bergschrund, and some loose rock bands to negotiate. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">All very sporty in a Purcell kind of way&#8211;5 hrs. 45 min. to the top. More than 20 peaks of 10,000&#8242; elevation can be seen from the summit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">For descent, there is a direct and easy route. Just east of the summit is a moderately grotty open gully on the S. side that leads to a 600-700&#8242; snow couloir giving onto snowfields below. This would also make a &#8220;cinchy&#8221; ascent route, although you may find the couloir icy at the top. For the rest of the descent, we followed the western of the two south-flowing creeks draining into the creek we had walked up. By staying on the W. bank and high above the creek, you can effect a painless descent through open timber with virtually no bushwhacking, rejoining the main creek at about 205-863 (3 hrs. from the summit to the carpark). <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Doing &#8220;Mt. Gansner&#8221; from the E. makes for a very pleasant general mountaineering outing of some 9-10 hours; parties should be equipped for glacier travel.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>MT.
