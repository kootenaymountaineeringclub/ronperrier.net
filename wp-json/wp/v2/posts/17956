I was really afraid it wasn\u2019t going to come back,\u201d the 51-year-old San Diego attorney recalls. The nurse attending her session quickly called in the psychiatrist, who verbally reassured St.Clair and squeezed her hand to make her feel safe. His soothing presence kept her calm during the 40 minutes until the hallucination passed and the drug was out of her system.<\/p>\n<p>The importance of having well-trained professionals administer powerful psychedelic drugs is becoming urgent now. Not only will Oregon soon allow mental-health treatments with psilocybin\u2014the active ingredient in magic mushrooms\u2014but the United States Food and Drug Administration is expected to evaluate its first true psychedelic, methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA, aka ecstasy), for treating post-traumatic stress disorder later this year.<\/p>\n<p>It was the realization that psychedelics might one day be integrated into mainstream medical care that spurred the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco to become the first in the U.S. to offer a psychedelic-assisted therapy training program seven years ago, says Janis Phelps, director of the school\u2019s Center for Psychedelic Therapies and Research.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop ImageGroup__Wrapper\" aria-label=\"Image Pair\" data-bumper-index=\"1\">\n<div class=\"ImageGroup__Images\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure id=\"69f960c9-d413-4cba-b472-d97b9dd7ca96_0\" class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/9046498d-cc03-4105-a8fd-820d2fdf69d6\/h_15514233.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=3840\" alt=\"A single blue pill capsule, containing a dose of psilocybin, is displayed in a ceramic chalice on a wooden table.\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure id=\"69f960c9-d413-4cba-b472-d97b9dd7ca96_1\" class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent\">\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/09df0056-91de-4985-8f22-06b2475f844b\/h_15514227.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=3840\" alt=\"A meditation chair at a Field Trip clinic in New York is fitted with a dome-shaped top that emits a blue light.\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption Caption--hideEndBug\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\"><strong>Left<\/strong>: A dose of psilocybin rests in a ceremonial chalice.

Psychotherapists, nurses, doctors, clergy, and others primarily in the mental health or spiritual professions are learning the chemistry of psychedelic molecules, safety concerns, historical Indigenous use, and, most importantly, the unique mental states unleashed by these drugs, whose effects last for six hours or more. But because psychedelics are currently illegal, no program enables participants to personally experience their effects.<\/p>\n<p>Demand for these courses is booming, experts say, in large part due to a better understanding of the drugs\u2019 potential mental health benefits. But national standards do not exist, leading to fears some graduates may have inadequate abilities as each institution create its own curriculum.<\/p>\n<h2>Inspired by promising clinical trials<\/h2>\n<p>Why are medical providers looking to MDMA as a potentially useful PTSD treatment? The powerful drug is thought to enable the brain to confront traumatic memories without triggering emotions like shame and rage, which can overwhelm and impede healing.<\/p>\n<p>Preliminary results from the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies\u2019 (MAPS) most recent large clinical trial confirm that two or three doses of MDMA\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/maps.org\/2023\/04\/05\/statement-maps-funded-phase-3-research-reports-results-from-long-term-observational-follow-up-study-on-mdma-assisted-therapy-for-ptsd\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reduced or eliminated<\/a>\u00a0PTSD.

(These findings were released in April on MAPS\u2019 website but have not been published in a medical journal.)<\/p>\n<p>Positive results were also noted in MAPS\u2019 first phase three clinical trial published in\u00a0<i>Nature Medicine<\/i>\u00a0in 2021, which showed that after three sessions of between 80 and 180\u2009milligram doses of MDMA, three preparatory therapy sessions, and nine sessions post-medication,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41591-021-01336-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">two-thirds<\/a>\u00a0of study participants no longer had PTSD.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--below-paragraph InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\" data-bumper-index=\"3\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/fbb269fb-0b03-4bba-b79c-89844561f771\/h_15697911.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=1702\" alt=\"A group stand, hands raised, in a circle around a setting of candles and flowers.\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">Staff and military veterans participate in a a candlelight ceremony to kick off a psychedelic retreat in Mexico.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><span class=\"RichText Caption__Credit\" aria-label=\"Photograph by Meridith Kohut, The New York Times\/Redux\">PHOTOGRAPH BY MERIDITH KOHUT, THE NEW YORK TIMES\/REDUX<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<p>Institutions around the world are revealing psychedelics\u2019 promise for a range of mental-health disorders, including\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/02698811211073759?rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&amp;url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">depression<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1177\/02698811211044688\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">anxiety<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jamapsychiatry\/fullarticle\/2795625\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">addiction<\/a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1177\/0269881119897615?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reducing the fear\u00a0<\/a>of being diagnosed with a terminal disease.<\/p>\n<p>Results like these inspired Anthony Back, a doctor at the University of Washington School of Medicine, to take the California Institute training in 2020. The 60-year-old Back says growing up in the 1980s around prominent antidrug ads kept him from experimenting in his youth. But the scientific research convinced him \u201cthere\u2019s something really important here.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In Back\u2019s work as a palliative care physician, his primary goal is to reduce pain for patients with cancer. But \u201cwe haven\u2019t had good ways of dealing with the terror\u201d of learning your life is likely ending, he says.<\/p>\n<h2>How to administer a psychedelic drug<\/h2>\n<p>Institutions offering training programs vary greatly. Oregon has authorized nearly\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/psilocybin.oregon.gov\/training-approved\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">two dozen<\/a>\u00a0groups to conduct training for its statewide program, ranging from small facilities like the Earth Medicine Center to established universities including the University of California, Berkeley. Around the country, programs generally last six months to a year and cost thousands of dollars.<\/p>\n<p>Most programs emphasize the importance of conducting multiple sessions before a drug is administered to discuss what patients hope to gain from the experience and what they might expect. Students also learn how to oversee the one or more sessions where the drug is administered. \u201cThe psychedelic experience is largely an internal one,\u201d Phelps says, so therapists are taught not to interject themselves unless required to restore a sense of safety.<\/p>\n<p>Administering psychedelic-assisted therapy is vastly different for professionals used to conventional mental-health treatments, says Bit Yaden, a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins Medicine, who is working on a pilot curriculum for Hopkins, Yale, and New York University psychiatry students. \u201cWhen I prescribe Lexapro, my patient picks up the prescription and I hear in a month how it\u2019s going,\u201d she says. But with psychedelics, the actual dispensing of the medicine along with subsequent talk therapy are required, she says. During the many hours of a psychedelic session, one or more therapists must remain in the room.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop ImageGroup__Wrapper\" aria-label=\"Image Pair\" data-bumper-index=\"6\">\n<div class=\"ImageGroup__Images\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure id=\"ba9cfeb1-0ae9-4b77-9910-9e6f8564e46d_0\" class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/6728f797-7924-45c1-a968-6275d1d9a54f\/GettyImages-1298857823.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=3840\" alt=\"A close up view of an IV drop containing ketamine.\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure id=\"ba9cfeb1-0ae9-4b77-9910-9e6f8564e46d_1\" class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/d9c9fe3e-82a5-4a71-a784-581c09dff0c8\/C0526767-Ketamine_crystals_light_micrograph.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=3840\" alt=\"Light micrograph of ketamine, crystallized from aqueous solution, showing hues of gold with streaks of blues and purples.\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption Caption--hideEndBug\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\"><strong>Left<\/strong>: Ketamine is administered via an intravenous drip at Palo Alto Mind Body. \u00a0To provide some understanding of a psychedelic experience, some programs encourage students to try ketamine to understand the extreme vulnerability of a being under the influence.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><span class=\"RichText Caption__Credit\" aria-label=\"Photograph by Yalonda M.

Here too, conventional therapists can find themselves in novel territory. \u201cIn psilocybin trials, there are reports of people having mystical experiences. Talking about those experiences may not have traditionally fit in a psychotherapeutic framework,\u201d Yaden says.<\/p>\n<p>Some programs have adopted the belief that therapists are best positioned to help others process powerful insights only after they have dealt with their own mental-health issues. That\u2019s why Vancouver Island University in Canada offers a year-long training with numerous personal-development exercises and discussions to foster the personal and emotional growth of the therapist. \u201cUsing psychedelics is a way of remembering who you are,\u201d says Geraldine Manson, a member of Canada\u2019s Snuneymuxw First Nation who teaches in the program.<\/p>\n<h2>Training without psychedelics<\/h2>\n<p>Because psychedelics remain illegal, most programs are unable to have students facilitate an actual session with a psychedelic, an unfortunate limitation to their training, Phelps says. (Vancouver Island\u2019s students, however, can do so because of government waivers allowing some mental-health patients to legally use the drugs.)<\/p>\n<p>For the same reason, many students haven\u2019t had personal experience with the drugs either. \u201cIt is clear when someone has never used a psychedelic. The types of questions they ask shows they have no idea what experience they\u2019ll be providing to their patient,\u201d says Pam Kryskow, medical chair of the Vancouver Island program.<\/p>\n<p>Some encourage students to try ketamine under supervision to understand the extreme vulnerability of a being under the influence. Others attempt to simulate the state with a breathing practice known as Holotropic breathwork, which employs fast respiration to yield temporarily altered consciousness.<\/p>\n<p>Some trainees seek out their own psychedelic experience with an underground guide or through by traveling to countries where Indigenous populations have long used the drugs. Palliative-care physician Back used a guide several years ago, an experience that prompted his desire to take the training. During the experience, as he later\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.liebertpub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/jpm.2018.0561\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote<\/a>\u00a0in a medical journal, \u201cmy familiar sense of \u2018me\u2019\u2014my preferences, my body, my history\u2014dropped away, all at once, and what became palpable was an oceanic sensation of being unified with everything\u2026.There was a sense of being complete belonging\u2026of having access to an energy in the universe that normally was hidden. It was exhilarating.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Back believes such a framework would be helpful for his terminal patients. \u201cI realized the process of dying was much more spiritual than I knew,\u201d he now says, and he is eager for these drugs to be legalized.<\/p>\n<p>Other medical professionals apparently feel similarly. In the California Institute\u2019s first class of 42 students, several doctors and nurses insisted their participation be kept quiet to avoid potential harm to their professional reputations. But this year, some 800 people competed for the school\u2019s 400 slots.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the growth, experts worry there won\u2019t be enough trained therapists to meet the expected demand after FDA approval of MDMA and possibly psilocybin, when thousands of professionals will be needed. In Oregon, not a single facilitator has so far met all criteria to be granted a license for psilocybin therapy.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;No training program is keeping up with the demand,\u201d Phelps laments. Her university is developing a licensing program so other colleges can obtain the school\u2019s training materials and videos, with some 25 already expressing interest, she says.<\/p>\n<p>The only way psychedelics can succeed as a mental-health remedy is by ensuring enough professionals receive high-quality training, Back says. \u201cThis is a different kind of treatment than most others. Those are about the technology or the drug. Here, you have to have the therapy and the medicine together.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/article>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Psychedelic medicine is coming\u2014but who\u2019s going to guide your trip?
