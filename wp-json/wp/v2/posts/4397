Treat this date as the only date you will ever have<\/strong> with this person \u2013 your entire relationship will occur now. Best to try to scare them away, tell them all your secrets \u2013 no worries as this is the only date you will ever have.  As the relationship happens now, this is the perfect place to have intimacy to discover what is possible. Radical honesty is best. Everyone wants intimacy, but it can be scary, so you need to figure out how to be safe.<br \/>\nWhat is more fulfilling? Most of the time you think you want to have sex, but what you want is to be close.<br \/>\n<strong>2. Create Intimacy<\/strong> = realness + atunement.<br \/>\nIntimacy is shown when you show what you are really like \u2013 you need to be real if you want to be close. To be seen for how you truly are shows a need to be loved and accepted. Practice sharing things that you would not normally.<br \/>\nAtunement is the sensing of what the other person is experiencing. Find out where they are at. Share how you are feeling in a skillful way that takes time to learn. Start often with \u201cI feel like \u2026\u2026.<br \/>\n<strong>3. Don\u2019t Reject.<\/strong><br \/>\nIf this is someone that will not \u2018work out\u2019 and you realize it soon after meeting them, you want to redirect to something you might be able to create intimacy with \u2013 try to  find common ground. Set boundaries eg. Don\u2019t want sex, not interested in this kind of interaction, but another kind. You are together now to make the most of this time. \u201cI feel bad about things maybe not working out \u2026.,<br \/>\n<strong>4. Lean into Trust<\/strong><br \/>\nIf you don\u2019t trust them, begin the possibility of trust. Don\u2019t take their mistrust personally. Try to learn why they can\u2019t trust. Take risks if you both feel safe.<br \/>\n<strong>5. Include Learning, Healing, and Growth.<\/strong><br \/>\nCounseling and deep dating have a lot in common \u2013 both need great intimacy. Talk about awkwardness and rejection.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>DEVELOPING IMMEDIATE INTENSITY As you look around a group of people, tiny things happen when you see someone: bring our a personal curiosity, notice judgements, alienations., fit people into categories.
