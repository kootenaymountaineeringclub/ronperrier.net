I started in Brisbane (after 3 months in Australia) and ended in Majuro Marshall Islands and the cheapest way home to Canada via Honolulu. My itinerary put Nauru in the middle to ensure the visa.<br \/>\n2. I had already been to Palau (7-day liveaboard, the best diving in the world, jellyfish lake), Guam, New Zealand, and Australia and YPT missed Vanuatu and Solomon Islands as I would not have gone on Group 4.<br \/>\n3. Preference on booking was given to those going on all four groups and it sold out within a few days, so I would have been excluded immediately (that\u2019s what happened to Natalie Leis).<br \/>\n4. Expensive especially with a single supplement.<\/p>\n<p>It is difficult to compare my costs to the YPT trip but my best guess is that YPT costs US$8900 (allowing $1500 Palau and Guam). My cost is US$6,000. $7000 adding Solomons and Vanuatu which is not in the YPT price, It is cheaper to go independently.<br \/>\nAll the prices in my post are in AUD \u2013 1US$ = 1.55AUD.<br \/>\nVisas are for a Canadian passport (Nauru was the only visa). See all the details on my website <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2023\/08\/01\/south-pacific\/\">https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2023\/08\/01\/south-pacific\/<\/a> 189\/193, 193\/197<br \/>\nNeither price includes the beginning (YPT to Palau, me Brisbane to Solomons) and end flights (YPT from Solomons, me Marshall Islands to Comox, BC Canada via Honolulu).<\/p>\n<p><em>Fiji Airlines.<\/em> Flies from Nadi, Fiji (NAN) to Vanuatu, Nauru, Samoa, Tonga and from Suva (SUV) to Tuvalu.<br \/>\n<em>Talofa Airways.<\/em> Apia (APW) Samoa to Pago Pago (PPG) American Samoa.<br \/>\n<em>Nauru Airlines Pacific Island Hopper.<\/em> Originates from Brisbane (BNE) and flies to Nauru (INU), Tarawa (TRW) Kiribati, Majuro (MAJ) Marshall Islands, Pohnpei (PNI) Micronesia and Palau (a new destination added Dec 2023).<br \/>\n<em>United Airlines Island Hopper<\/em> flies between US and quasi-US islands \u2013 East to West on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, and West to East on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
