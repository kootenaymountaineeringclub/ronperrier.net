Augustus Heinze was the force behind the line, as he was also the developer behind the Trail Smelter and worked quickly to gain a competitive advantage before the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway into the Kootenay region.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Initially, it was a <span class=\"nowrap\">3\u00a0ft<\/span>\u00a0(<span class=\"nowrap\">914\u00a0mm<\/span>) narrow gauge line, and the steep, 3,400-foot (1,036 m) rise of the mountain from the Columbia River necessitated the use of three Shay locomotives to move the open ore cars, past the fruit trees of Warfield, and onto the LeRoi and War Eagle mines.<br \/>\n<em><strong>Rossland Railroad Grades.<\/strong><\/em> Trails with a moderate grade for walking, jogging and snowshoeing exist on the abandoned CPR grade. The original CPR grade can be followed from Union St, just below Spokane Avenue in Rossland, 7.1 km to Warfield (elevation loss 330m 1080\u2032), where it ends near the municipal works yard. Coordinate with the bus for a ride back to Rossland. The bus has racks for bikes.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The CPR railway grade stops at Union Avenue now.

The C&amp;K started building from Sproats Landing (across the Columbia River from present-day Castlegar) and was the first segment of what became the Southern mainline. Completion of this line provided transportation of ore from Nelson north on paddle wheelers over the Arrow Lakes and Columbia River to the CPR mainline at Revelstoke. A short extension of the C&amp;K from Sproats Landing to Robson allowed for the construction of a rail barge slip. Robson became the terminus of the active C&amp;K railway. Barges at first joined the C&amp;K and C&amp;W railways between Robson and West Robson. The Bridge across the Columbia River was completed in 1902, completing the last link in a continuous rail line between Nelson and Midway. This line was renamed the Boundary Subdivision in 1910. Grade revisions were made in the early 1940s and late 1960s to accommodate the construction of the dams at Brilliant and Labarthe (Hugh L Keenleyside Dam).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">After the CPR had a standard gauge portage railway running from Nelson to Robson in 1891, they embarked on a massive expansion. This expansion included placing a line over the Crowsnest Pass to Creston, which indirectly connected to Nelson, and then to the portage railway down the Kootenay River. The fundamental basis for all of this was to move coal from Fernie to the smelter at Trail, in connection with shifting the ore down Red Mountain and sending the final reduced concentrates out to the Eastern US. The purchase of the C and W lines allowed for the continued westward expansion of a standard-gauge line. This was done by 1900, running a link via Brooklyn, Gladstone and Paulson to Grand Forks.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A wooden railway bridge, crossing the large Columbia River, was built in 1902 at Robson to the new town of Castlegar on the west bank. Thus, by this time, the Kettle Valley Railway and the Columbia and Western Railway were physically joined to the central Canadian Pacific system via Princeton, Brookmere, Merritt and Spences Bridge. The Coquihalla Pass line to Hope was finished in 1916. Again, the Canadian Pacific had extensive fleets of lake steamers and tugs on the Okanagan, Arrow, Slocan and Kootenay Lakes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><b>Railway Construction Castlegar to Midway.\u00a0<\/b>In 1890, gold and copper were discovered near Rossland. The Columbia and Western Railway (C&amp;W) was chartered to run from the smelter in Trail to Penticton. This line was completed to Robson West in 1897. The C&amp;W from Rossland to Trail was a narrow-gauge railway to the smelter at Trail. On April 2, 1898, surveyors led by Rice reached Grand Forks with slashing crews following close behind them. By September 24, six railroad construction camps between Cascade and Grand Forks employed 250 men. A portable sawmill, operated by McPherson and Stout, supplied rail ties and timbers, and W.H. Fisher supplied 70,000 rail ties from a site north of Niagara. The Columbia and Western Railway was purchased from mining developer Fritz Heinze, along with the Trail Smelter, by the CPR in 1898.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Boundary country ore (from the City of Paris Mine) was delivered to the Trail Smelter. On November 25, 1899, passenger service was extended to Greenwood. By 1900, the railroad had reached Midway with a branch line from Eholt to the copper-rich area of Phoenix. Construction of this railroad required great effort and was often extremely dangerous. On January 11, 1900, two men were killed by a flying rock. On February 4, 1900, 100 men were sent out on two shovel drifts. By reaching the Boundary District, the CPR had scored a significant victory against its American railroad competitors in its bid to re-establish Canadian control in southern British Columbia. American communities along the Kettle River and tributary valleys south of the international boundary found it easier to ship via CPR than to use the long and rough wagon roads leading to J.J. Hill\u2019s Great Northern (GN) railroad in Washington State.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Trackage was added to West Midway following the abandonment of the Carmi Subdivision (Kettle River Railway) in 1978.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><b>Branch Line from Grand Forks to Republic.\u00a0<\/b>The Kettle River Valley Railway (KRVR) extended its service south from Grand Forks to the copper mining areas of Republic, Washington, in 1902. This line was followed later that year by the Great Northern Vancouver Victoria &amp; Eastern Railway (VV&amp;E) and the Washington &amp; Great Northern Railway (W&amp;GN), which was also built to the Republic. After Great Northern controlled lines connected the Republic with the Granby Smelter, the KRVR lost most of its market to the much larger GN. The fierce rivalry between the U.S. and Canadian railroads included considerable legal maneuvering and occasional skirmishes between construction crews, such as the \u201cBattle of Midway\u201d.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The W&amp;GN and VV&amp;E railways eventually completed an international route through Midway, Bridesville, Oroville, Keremeos, and Princeton to Brookmere. From Brookmere, trackage rights over CPR\u2019s Kettle Valley Railway and Canadian Northern Railway (now Canadian National Railway) formed a route to the Great Northern Fraser Valley network, which terminated at Vancouver. Burlington Northern passenger trains from Spokane began to pass through Grand Forks in 1909. Many of the lines west of Curlew were abandoned during the 1930s, and passenger service on GN between Republic and Grand Forks was discontinued in 1938.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><b>Branch Line from Eholt to Phoenix. <\/b>Although the vast copper deposits at Phoenix were discovered in 1891, it was not until CPR\u2019s Columbia &amp; Western Railway entered the Boundary District in 1899 that development became feasible. Only with the construction of the Granby Company\u2019s large smelter at Grand Forks and the construction of CPR\u2019s branch into Phoenix could the ore be extracted and refined economically. Phoenix Branch construction began from Eholt on CPR\u2019s Boundary Section in 1899. Many crews were employed to work on this construction. One of these crews, working under J.V. Welsh, consisted of 125 men. The last spike on this branch was driven at Phoenix on May 23, 1900. The Grand Forks Smelter was completed by August of that year, and several spurs were added later to serve other mines. One of these spurs led to the Smelter Lake Dam, the remains of which are visible today.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">CPR\u2019s Shay-type geared locomotives were transferred from the Rossland Branch for use on the steep grades of the Phoenix Branch. These engines were withdrawn after a spectacular runaway accident (Dead-man\u2019s Wreck) which destroyed a CPR engine in 1904. By 1905, the VV&amp;E was also operating a line into the mining areas of Phoenix, and GN opened its line later that year. With easier grades than CPR\u2019s Phoenix Branch from Eholt, GN was able to handle heavier trains and soon became the primary carrier of Phoenix ores to the Grand Forks smelter. In 1913, the CPR allowed the KRVR to use its Grand Forks roundhouse in exchange for the CPR\u2019s use of the Kettle River Valley Railway\u2019s downtown station.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><b>Beginnings of a Line North from Grand Forks.\u00a0<\/b>In 1904, the Kettle River Valley Railway (KRVR) received permission to build north from Grand Forks on a route projected to run through Vernon to the coal fields of the Nicola area. Construction was slow, and by 1907, the line had stalled at Lynch Creek, only 20 miles north of Cuprum. The following year, negotiations began with the CPR, resulting in a 1910 agreement between the CPR and KRVR charter and in 1911, the name was officially simplified to Kettle Valley Railway (KVR). When the line was leased to the CPR in 1913, the KVR became the seed which allowed the CPR to complete its southern route westward from Midway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><b>Spur from Greenwood to Mother Lode.\u00a0<\/b>A branch line was constructed by the CPR from Greenwood to Deadwood Camp and the Mother Lode Mine in 1900. Also called the Deadwood Spur, the line opened the copper-rich Deadwood Ridge area for mining development\u2014the B.C. Copper Company Smelter was completed in 1901 on the spur above Greenwood and shortly thereafter employed 400 men. The company built a smelter at Grand Forks that, in 1900, was connected to the mines at Phoenix by a branch of the CPR. The first ore was shipped in July of that year, and the smelter blew in on August 21. By 1905, more than 1,995,800 tonnes of ore had been shipped, and the Granby smelter became the largest copper smelter in the British Empire and the second largest in the world. In 1910, most of the ore bodies at Phoenix were under the control of the Granby Company. However, some remained in the hands of the B.C. Copper Company and the New Dominion Copper Company, which shipped ore to their smelters at Greenwood and Boundary Falls.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>The Latter Years (The 50\u2019s, 60\u2019s, 70\u2019s, and 80\u2019s)<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">After the completion of the Kettle Valley Railway linking Midway to Hope through Penticton and Princeton and over the Coquilhalla Pass in 1915, Nelson had become only a day\u2019s travel by passenger train from Vancouver and ten hours from Penticton. Trade and commerce in the Kootenays, which were once dependent upon Great Northern and Spokane in the United States, came under British Columbia\u2019s control. Trade in southern B.C. had all but ceased to flow across the border to the U.S.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Following World War 1, copper prices fell, and the copper mines and the Granby and Greenwood smelters closed. Between 1918 and 1920, every copper smelter in the Boundary District closed down, effectively destroying CPR\u2019s hopes that Boundary copper traffic would be redirected to Vancouver on their Kettle Valley Railway. The Phoenix spur from Eholt was closed in 1919 and abandoned in 1921. The Mother Lode spur from Greenwood was abandoned in 1919.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Daily passenger service, which included eastbound Train #11 (Kootenay Express) and westbound Train #12 (Kettle Valley Express), was continued throughout most of the railroad\u2019s operating history. After the war, the railroad also experienced an increase in local freight traffic. The three biggest local traffic commodities during the post-war years were coal, lumber and fruit. When the highways and airlines stripped the KVR of its passenger trade and its lucrative freight traffic, the railway\u2019s steep grades became uncompetitive relative to the lesser grades of CPR\u2019s mainline. Another factor leading to the demise of the KVR was the opening of the Hope-Princeton highway in 1951. The remaining bulk commodity traffic required longer and heavier trains.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although the KVR produced an operating profit for most of its years, the railway never came close to paying off the massive capital investment of its rugged construction. Nevertheless, the KVR halted the flow of Kootenay trade to the United States at a critical time in B.C.\u2019s history and thus provided an essential contribution to the development of the Province.<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Freight service on the KVR was terminated shortly after abandonment of the Coquihalla line in July 1961, and due to major devastation by avalanches the previous winter. The line was abandoned after serving for nearly 50 years. The extensive bridges of this line quickly succumbed to the forces of nature and the demolition practices of the Canadian Army. Some of the smaller bridges that crossed narrow creeks were sold for scrap. Most of the resident buildings, station platforms and other right-of-way buildings were torn down or set ablaze. Rolling stock was removed, followed by rails and ties. The 131 miles of trackage between Penticton and Midway were abandoned in 1978. This portion is now part of the Trans Canada Trail network in southern B.C. Rails were removed between Midway and Castlegar in 1990.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Today, Burlington Northern continues to provide rail service to Pope &amp; Talbot (now Interfor) sawmill for a little longer, as they too are struggling along. The section in the industrial area between the two bridges in Grand Forks was purchased from CPR in 1992 by Pope &amp; Talbot and CanPar Industries, which operate it as a private railway. This section of the railroad has remained in active use. A bypass trail routes you to the town of Grand Forks and connects you back to the Columbia and Western. The entire railway, including the Kettle Valley Railway, is now part of the Spirit of 2010 Trail and Trans-Canada Trail systems in British Columbia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>COLUMBIA &amp; WESTERN RAIL TRAIL &#8211; Castlegar to Midway\u00a0<\/strong>164 km<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Travels the abandoned Canadian Pacific Boundary Subdivision with the last train going through in 1991.

Only by acquiring the KRVP did the CPR manage to get a foothold within the Municipality.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The trail gets ugly as it becomes thoroughly chewed up from ATVs and dirt bikes, making it a struggle, even with the manageable uphill grade.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;\">Km 96.4 Granby Station.\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>Passenger flag stops at the junction from which CPR\u2019s 3.5 kilometres (2.2 miles) Granby Smelter Spur climbed to the Granby Consolidated Mining Company\u2019s copper smelter. The smelter was once the largest copper smelter in B.C. Today, the smelter site is surrounded by giant slag piles. The slag is being utilized for roofing granules and as an abrasive for sand-blasting ships. Pacific Abrasives holds rights to the slag piles, which the City of Grand Forks owns.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;\">Km 100.3 Fisherman Station.\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>Former siding and steam locomotive water stop. This station was named Niagara until 1900, after which the name was given to the nearby Kettle River Valley Railway station. Around the turn of the century, Niagara was a wild, open boom town. Several bake ovens built by Italian railway cooks remain near the Lime Creek crossing on the flat site of Neil Hardy\u2019s Lime Creek Hotel. Seven miles of rock work were required to construct the nearby section of the railroad.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Willgress Lake Campsite is about 30km uphill from Grand Forks.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;\">Km 108.8 Eholt Station.\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>Junction with CPR\u2019s branch line into the copper mining area of Phoenix.

Divisional station between CPR\u2019s Columbia and Western and Kettle Valley railways. Following the abandonment of the KVR to Penticton in 1978, the station served as the western terminus of CPR\u2019s southern route. The Crow\u2019s Nest Pass and Boundary Subdivision yard limits were extended to include trackage 3.9 km (2.4 miles) west of Midway station to service Pope and Talbot\u2019s Midway (Interfor 2010) sawmill. The 1909 heritage depot has been restored, designated a heritage building, and is presently used as a railway museum.

It was <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">originally a railroad that was operated by the Canadian Pacific Railroad (CPR). It was <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">acquired by the Trans Canada Trail Foundation from CPR in 1993 and donated to the <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Province of BC in 2004. The trail at the time, was managed by Tourism BC.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In 2010, the trail was designated as a Recreational Trail under the Forest and Range<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Practices Act and was managed by Recreation Sites and Trails Branch (RST). <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">On July 3, 2020, a Ministerial Order M322 was signed that removed a 67 km section of the CWRT from the established recreation site. The section that was removed was from the Castlegar terminus of the CWRT to just north of Christina Lake. The reason for disestablishing this portion of the trail was attributed to the route\u2019s challenging terrain; multiple competing users; and the complex infrastructure.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">After this portion of the CWRT was disestablished, it became a non-status rail grade on<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">crown land. At this time, there is no preventative maintenance being conducted on the<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">CWRT and there is no funding available for maintenance of the rail grade. The rail grade is <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">currently being managed to a wilderness status.
