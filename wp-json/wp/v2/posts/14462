Situated strategically on a branch of the Silk Road that linked China to the West, Taxila reached its apogee between the 1st and 5th centuries. It is now one of the most important archaeological sites in Asia.<br \/>\nPrehistoric <em><strong>mound of Saraikala<\/strong><\/em> represents the earliest settlement of Taxila, with evidence of Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Iron Age occupation.<br \/>\nThe <em><strong>Bhir mound<\/strong><\/em> is the earliest historic city of Taxila, and was probably founded in the 6th century BC by the Achaemenians. Its stone walls, house foundations, and winding streets represent the earliest forms of urbanization on the subcontinent. Bihr is also associated with Alexander the Great\u2019s triumphant entry into Taxila in 326 BC.<br \/>\n<strong><em>Sirkap<\/em><\/strong> was a fortified city founded during the mid-2nd century BC. The many private houses, stupas, and temples were laid out on the Hellenistic grid system and show the strong Western classical influence on local architecture.

The final occupational phase was a large walled rectangular area with a grid iron network of streets and lanes dividing the settlement into regular blocks. Walls delineating individual buildings and street frontages are clearly visible in the early morning dew or after rain and it is also possible to identify the location of a number of small-scale industrial areas within the site marked, as they are, by eroding kilns and scatters of slag. The surface of the mound is littered with thousands of shreds and artefacts, slowly eroding out of room fills.<br \/>\nThe archaeological sequence at the site of Rehman Dheri is over 4.5 metres deep, and covers a sequence of over 1,400 years beginning at c.3,300 BC. The site represents following periods: I c.3300-3850 BC, II c.2850-2500 BC, III c.2500-1900 BC<br \/>\nAlthough its excavators have cut a number of deep trenches or soundings into the lower levels, the areas exposed have been too limited to undertake a study of change in layout and the spatial distribution of craft activities.<br \/>\nIt was abandoned at the beginning of the mature Indus phase by the middle of the third millennium BC.

There are 210 square holes on the outer surface of the minar, arranged at regular intervals i~ 14 rows. A spiral straircase consisting of 108 steps has been provided ins-.de the minar. Alongside the staircase, there are 11 ascending rectangular arched openings provided for air and light. The minar is divided into six tiers of different height. The base of each tier has projected moulding and the lowest tier has an arched opening for an entrance. The entire exterior as well as interior of the minar has lime plaster, apparently with some floral or lineal fresco paintings. The thick lime plaster applied over the surface of the lowest tier has been divided into decorative panels or arched niches and horizontal bands in high relief. Facing the grand minar on the east side is a big tank with a causeway leading to the octagonal baradari (pavilion) built in the middle There is a square pavilion at each corner with a gateway to the baradari.<br \/>\nThe tank is rectangular in shape, each side has a ramp and a parapet wall and is flanked by four staircases of 8 steps. During Mughal days, a channel was cut from the Aik rivulet and connected with the tank at its north-west corner; in addition, an elaborate system for filling up the tank with rain water from the catchment area was devised.<br \/>\nA causeway, standing on 21 pointed arched pillars, connects the main baradari with the gateway. In the centre of the tank has been erected an octagonal platform with a low parapet wall on all sides. Over the platform stands the beautiful baradari in the same plan, The baradari was constructed under the orders of the Emperor Jahangir in 1620 A.D. for use as a royal residence.<br \/>\n<strong>The Salt Range and Khewra Salt Mine<\/strong>\u00a0Tentative WHS (12\/04\/2016). Rising abruptly from the Punjab plains west of the River Jhelum and ending equally precipitously on the Indus River, one hundred and eighty kilometres in the west, the Salt Range is a long linear formation of sheer escarpments, jagged peaks, rolling hills and desolate ravines. Nestling between these hills, are fertile valleys scattered with lakes and irrigated by spring fed streams. The Salt Range originated 800 million years ago when evaporation of a shallow sea followed by under thrusting of the Indian Plate formed a range that stretched for about 300 kilometres. The range derives its name from the occurrence of the thickest seams of rock salt in the world embedded in the Precambrian bright red marls of the Salt Range Formation. The Salt Range constitutes a narrow zone of localized strong folding, faulting and uplift, in contrast to the open folds of low structural relief in the Potwar Plateau and no deformation at all in the immediately adjacent Punjab Plain.<br \/>\nIt represents an open book of geology with richly fossiliferous stratified rocks, all excellently exposed due to lack of vegetation. The exposure shows tectonic features and a diverse range of floral and faunal fossils including well preserved complete body fossils of invertebrate and vertebrate fauna, their skeletal grains, faunal molds and castes along with a large variety of ichno-fossils.<br \/>\nHominidae remains have been found.

Nearby are the ruins of Sahr-i-Bahlol, a small fortified city dating from the same period. On various hilltops ranging from 36.6 metres to 152.4 metres in height, typical for Buddhist sites. The complexes cover an area of around 33ha.<br \/>\nThe Buddhist monastery was in continual use until the 7th century AD. It is composed of an assemblage of buildings and is the most complete Buddhist monastery in Pakistan. The buildings were constructed of stone in Gandhara patterns (diaper style) using local dressed and semi-dressed stone blocks.<br \/>\nToday the ruins comprise a main stupa court, votive stupas court, a group of three stupas, the monastic quadrangle with meditation cells, conference hall, covered stepped passageways and other secular buildings.<br \/>\nThe second component, the Neighbouring City Remains at Sahr-i-Bahlol, is located approximately 5 km away in a fertile plain. The ruins are the remnants of a small ancient fortified town of the Kushan period.

An integral part of the ancient\u00a0Silk Road, it has long had substantial cultural, economic, and geopolitical significance for\u00a0Eurasian\u00a0trade. Throughout history, it has been an important\u00a0trade route\u00a0between\u00a0Central Asia\u00a0and the\u00a0Indian subcontinent\u00a0and a vital\u00a0strategic\u00a0military\u00a0choke point\u00a0for various states that came to control it. The summit of the pass is 5\u00a0km (3.1\u00a0mi) inside Pakistan at Landi Kotal, while the lowest point is .46\u00a0km (0.29\u00a0mi) at Jamrud in the Valley of Peshawar. The Khyber Pass is part of Asian Highway1 (AH1).<br \/>\nThe inhabitants of the area are predominantly from the\u00a0Afridi\u00a0and\u00a0Shinwari\u00a0tribes of\u00a0Pashtuns.<br \/>\nWell-known invasions of the area have been predominantly through the Khyber Pass, such as the invasions by\u00a0Cyrus,\u00a0Darius I,\u00a0Genghis Khan\u00a0and later Mongols. The Khyber Pass became a critical part of the\u00a0Silk Road. The\u00a0Parthian Empire\u00a0fought for control of passes such as this to gain access to the silk, jade, rhubarb, and other luxuries moving from China to Western Asia and Europe. Through the Khyber Pass,\u00a0Gandhara\u00a0(in present-day Pakistan) became a regional center of trade connecting\u00a0Bagram\u00a0in Afghanistan to\u00a0Taxila\u00a0in Pakistan, adding Indian luxury goods such as ivory, pepper, and textiles to the Silk Road commerce.<br \/>\nThe Afridis and the Afghan\u00a0Shinwaris\u00a0have regarded the Pass as their own preserve and have levied a toll on travellers for safe conduct. Since this has long been their main source of income, resistance to challenges to the Shinwaris&#8217; authority has often been fierce.<br \/>\nFor strategic reasons, after the\u00a0First World War\u00a0the government of British India built a heavily engineered railway through the Pass. The\u00a0Khyber Pass Railway\u00a0from\u00a0Jamrud, near\u00a0Peshawar, to the\u00a0Afghan\u00a0border near\u00a0Landi Kotal\u00a0was opened in 1925.<br \/>\nThe Pass became widely known to thousands of Westerners and Japanese who traveled it in the days of the\u00a0hippie trail, taking a bus or car from\u00a0Kabul\u00a0to the Afghan border. At the Pakistani frontier post, travelers were advised not to wander away from the road, as the location was a barely controlled\u00a0Federally Administered Tribal Area. Then, after customs formalities, a quick daylight drive through the Pass was made.<br \/>\nThe area of the Khyber Pass has been connected with a counterfeit arms industry, making various types of weapons known to gun collectors as\u00a0Khyber Pass copies, using local steel and\u00a0blacksmiths&#8217;\u00a0forges.<br \/>\nDuring the\u00a0War in Afghanistan, the Khyber Pass has been a major route for resupplying military armament and food to the\u00a0NATO\u00a0forces in the Afghan theater of conflict since the US started the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. Almost 80 percent of the NATO and US supplies that are brought in by road were transported through the Khyber Pass. It has also been used to transport civilians from the Afghan side to the Pakistani one. Until the end of 2007, the route had been relatively safe since the tribes living there (mainly\u00a0Afridi, a\u00a0Pashtun tribe) were paid by the Pakistani government to keep the area safe. However, after that year, the\u00a0Taliban\u00a0began to control the region, and so there started to exist wider tensions in their political relationship. Since the end of 2008, supply convoys and depots in this western part have increasingly come under attack by elements from or supposedly sympathetic to the Pakistani Taliban.<br \/>\n<strong>Khyber Train Safari<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><strong>Attock Fort,<\/strong>\u00a0<\/span>Attock Khurd:<br \/>\n<strong><em>Vestiges of the Past<br \/>\n<\/em>Ranigat<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Sheri Khan Tarakai<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Takht-I-Bahi<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong><em><br \/>\n<\/em>Chitral Gol NP<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Lulusar-Dudipatsar NP<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Saiful Muluk NP<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Sheikh Badin NP<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Lakes:<\/strong>Lake Saiful Muluk, Lulusar Lake<\/p>\n<p><strong>Jarogo Waterfall<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Sajikot Waterfall<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Sanghao Cave<br \/>\n<\/strong>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>AZAD KASHMIR<\/strong><\/span>\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>(Muzaffarabad, Neelum Valley)<br \/>\n<\/strong>Pakistan administered portion of Jammu &amp; Kashmir region.<strong><br \/>\nMuzaffarabad.\u00a0<\/strong>Capital of\u00a0Azad Kashmir\u00a0and a very picturesque city.<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Arang Kel<\/strong> is a village and tourist spot in the\u00a0Neelam valley\u00a0of\u00a0Azad Kashmir.

An extreme mountain area between Skardu and Gilgit. Declared in 1993, the largest protected area in Pakistan, covering over 10,557.73 km2. The area is part of the Asian high-mountain system of Hindukush- Karakorum-West Himalaya &#8211; a place of superlatives: the highest park in the world, sixty peaks over 7,000 m, ten of the world\u2019s highest and most famous mountains, four peaks over 8000 m.a.s.l. and K2, the second highest peak in the world.<br \/>\nThe park is in a highly active tectonic zone. About 60 million to 20 million years ago, the Indian continental plate subducted under the Eurasian plate and, with the effects of extrusion and uplift of the Indian plate, several immense mountains were formed making it one of the most tectonically-active locations in the world.<br \/>\n<strong><em>Glaciers.<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0Almost half of the park comprises glaciers with the longest glaciers outside the Polar Regions. Famous glaciers such as Hispar, Biafo, Baltoro and Chogo Lungma form complex glacial systems occupying valleys and in some cases entire watersheds.<br \/>\nUpsurges: in the last century, 26 surges were detected in the Karakoram Range, rapid advances that involved at least 17 glaciers. In 1955, Kutiah glacier advanced 12 km. in only three months, the fastest glacial surge ever recorded. Glacier tongues enlarge and push forward at a rapid pace, becoming devastating flows of ice and rock, blocking valleys, closing roads and caravan routes and creating lakes.<br \/>\nThis trend in upsurge is part of a complicated phenomenon known as the &#8220;Karakoram Anomaly,&#8221; where glaciers in the Karakoram mountains have overall remained stable and even increased in mass, in contrast to many glaciers nearby and worldwide which have receded during the past 150 years, particularly in recent decades. The area has a unique weather pattern that keeps the ice cold and dry during the summer months. Unlike the rest of the Himalayas, the Karakoram region is not negatively affected by summer monsoon season, when although the ice melts a little, the melting is offset by heavy snowfall in the extremely cold winters.<br \/>\n<em><strong>Landslides<\/strong><\/em> are common. Bring disaster and destruction, but also creat new landforms with potential for habitation and agriculture. Most villages and their fields are often located on land resulting from former landslides.<br \/>\n<em><strong>Diversity.<\/strong><\/em> The Karakorum Range lies in a transitional zone between arid Central Asia and the semi-humid tropics of South Asia. Within the CKNP there is a variety of ecosystems, from rock cliffs to juniper shrub land, conifer and broadleaf forests and alpine pastures, home to a very high level of biodiversity. These diverse ecosystems provide a refuge for threatened species of mammals such as arkhor, musk deer, snow leopard, Ladakh urial and Marco Polo sheep, and also for important \u201cflagship\u201d species including the Himalayan Ibex and Lynx, Blue Sheep and Grey Wolf.<br \/>\n90 species of birds use alpine and moraine lakes as important stopovers on the Indus flyway and are part of one of the largest migratory bird routes in the world.<br \/>\n<strong><em>Human impact.<\/em><\/strong> There are 230 settlements of approximately 115,000 people living immediately adjacent to the park, the borders of which have been designed to exclude all villages and pasture lands. However, these communities have traditional rights in the park area to access seasonal pastures for grazing, hunting, collecting firewood, timber and medicinal plants.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Deosai National Park<\/strong> Tentative WHS (12\/04\/2016).
