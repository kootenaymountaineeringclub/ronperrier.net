The widow was paid to move out, and Peter spent a week as Kist&#8217;s houseguest and returned several times, the last in 1717. The czar was traveling incognito under the name Peter Michaeloff and while Kist did not reveal his guest&#8217;s identity it did not take long for Peter to be recognized, making his observations difficult.

The people on this narrow strip of land struggled against the waters of the North Sea from the west and the waters of the IJ and the Haarlem Lake from the east. Haarlem became wealthy with toll revenues that it collected from ships and travelers moving on this busy North-South route. However, as shipping became increasingly important economically, the city of Amsterdam became the main Dutch city of North Holland during the Dutch Golden Age. Haarlem became a quiet bedroom community but still has many of its central medieval buildings intact.

The Beemster Polder was dried during the period 1609 through 1612.

A grid of canals parallels the grid of roads in the Beemster. The grids are offset: the larger feeder canals are offset by approximately one kilometre from the larger roads. The municipality of Beemster consists of the following cities, towns, villages, and\/or districts:\u00a0Middenbeemster,\u00a0Noordbeemster,\u00a0Westbeemster,\u00a0Zuidoostbeemster.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"image\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/File:Gem-Beemster-OpenTopo.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/5\/5b\/Gem-Beemster-OpenTopo.jpg\/500px-Gem-Beemster-OpenTopo.jpg\" srcset=\"\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/5\/5b\/Gem-Beemster-OpenTopo.jpg\/750px-Gem-Beemster-OpenTopo.jpg 1.5x, \/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/5\/5b\/Gem-Beemster-OpenTopo.jpg\/1000px-Gem-Beemster-OpenTopo.jpg 2x\" alt=\"Gem-Beemster-OpenTopo.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"515\" data-file-width=\"5030\" data-file-height=\"5185\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nAround 800 AD the area was covered in peat. During 1150-1250 peat-digging and storm floods enlarged a small river into an inland sea, a lake in open connection with the Zuiderzee. A ring dike a meter high was made and in 1612 the polder was dry and the country was divided among the investors. In the earlier days of the polder, farmers occupied its lands for growing the crops necessary for long sea journeys by the VOC to the East Indies. It turned out that the farmland was so good that the project was considered then to be an economic success.\u00a0 A co-op was formed in 1901 to create cheese made from milk that comes from the Beemster polder. Today Beemster Cheese <sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>is sold in Europe, as well as the U.S., Canada, Japan, and China.<br \/>\nSince 1999 the entire Beemster Polder has been on the UNESCO World Heritage list: a masterpiece of creative planning, it had a lasting impact on reclamation projects in Europe and beyond.<\/p>\n<p>The Nomad Mania series &#8220;Small Towns&#8221; lists several north of Amsterdam.

Before the\u00a0poldering\u00a0of the lakes surrounding it, De Rijp was a port town with merchant ships that travelled the high seas. The town had a medium-sized herring fleet, and larger ships whaled. The polders meant that the Rijper ships needed to travel much further before they were on open water but the herring industry remained important.<br \/>\nAfter a fire that destroyed the south side of the town in 1654, the church had stained glass windows donated from towns all over Holland and they\u00a0are considered national treasures.

During Holland&#8217;s &#8216;Golden Age&#8217; (or &#8216;Golden Century&#8217;), Hoorn was an important home base for the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and a very prosperous centre of trade. The Hoorn fleet plied the seven seas and returned laden with precious commodities. Exotic spices such as pepper, nutmeg, cloves, and mace were sold at vast profits. With their skill in trade and seafaring, the sons of Hoorn established the town&#8217;s name far and wide. Jan Pieterszoon Coen (1587\u20131629) is famous for his violent raids in the Dutch Indies (now Indonesia), where he &#8220;founded&#8221; the city of Batavia in 1619 (now Jakarta).

He built several fortresses to control the region, one of which was Kasteel Radboud in Medemblik and was awarded Medemblik city rights in 1289. Medemblik obtained town walls in 1572 so that the castle lost its role as a refuge for the citizens, it fell into decay, but in 1889 was restored to be used as a courthouse until 1934. Anticipating the German invasion, the Rijksmuseum in September 1939 chose the castle as the initial hiding place of Rembrandt&#8217;s Night Watch.<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-castle_6-1\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>Medemblik is best known in Europe for its sailing events. Medemblik further has a picturesque small inner city with many houses from the 17th and 18th centuries, two big churches, an old orphanage, a town hall and, of course, castle Radboud, which is just at the border of the inner city.<\/p>\n<p><b>DEN HELDER<\/b>\u00a0is a municipality and a\u00a0city at the northernmost point of the\u00a0North Holland\u00a0peninsula. It is home to the country&#8217;s main\u00a0naval base. From here the\u00a0Royal TESO\u00a0ferryboat service operates the transportation link between Den Helder and the nearby Dutch\u00a0Wadden island of\u00a0Texel\u00a0to the north.<br \/>\n<strong>History.<\/strong> Due to its strategic location at the tip of the North Holland peninsula, multiple fortifications were built in the area and it\u00a0played an important part in Dutch shipping. During the\u00a0Dutch Golden Age, ships would be assembled near Den Helder and sail the world&#8217;s oceans from there.<br \/>\nDuring the 1820s, the\u00a0North Holland Canal\u00a0was dug from\u00a0Amsterdam\u00a0to Den Helder. The lighthouse\u00a0<i>Lange Jaap<\/i>\u00a0was built in 1877 and is the tallest cast-iron lighthouse in Europe, at 63.45 meters (208.2\u00a0ft). In the\u00a0Second World War, most of the city was evacuated. Den Helder was the site of a naval base as early as the 18th century.\u00a0In 1947, it officially became the\u00a0Royal Netherlands Navy&#8217;s main centre of operations.<br \/>\nDen Helder is on the tip of a lowland peninsula jutting out into the\u00a0North Sea\u00a0Because of this, Den Helder&#8217;s climate is heavily moderated by the maritime environment. Also, Den Helder is the sunniest city in the Netherlands.<br \/>\n<strong>Marinemusum<\/strong> (Museum of the Dutch Navy). Near the Texel ferry terminal, the submarine <strong>Tonijn<\/strong> is the showpiece of the museum. It had 67 crew and is in its original state.

It is situated north of\u00a0Den Helder.<br \/>\nThe island of Texel was originally made up of two islands, Texel proper to the south and\u00a0Eierland\u00a0to the northeast, that was connected by\u00a0shoals. In the early 17th century, the islands were connected by a\u00a0dyke\u00a0to keep the\u00a0North Sea\u00a0from ravaging the coastal areas of Texel proper. In the mid-nineteenth century, a\u00a0polder\u00a0completed the northern half of the island. Today, Texel forms the largest natural barrier between the North Sea and the\u00a0Wadden Sea.<br \/>\nThe dune landscape along the western coast of the island is protected as\u00a0<strong>Dunes of Texel National Park<\/strong>. Notable areas include\u00a0De Slufter, where the tide comes in and meets the dunes, forming a marshy environment rich in both fauna and flora. Texel is known as a unique habitat for wildlife, particularly in winter, when\u00a0birds of prey\u00a0and\u00a0geese\u00a0take up residence. About one-third of Texel is a protected nature reserve. A wetland called Utopia has been designed for birds to nest in.\u00a0<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>The tourism industry forms a substantial part of the economy in Texel with 70% of activities related to tourism. Popular activities include cycling, walking, swimming, and horse riding. <strong>Eierland Lighthouse.<br \/>\n<\/strong>Transport to Texel is usually by ferry (Royal TESO), from\u00a0Den Helder.

The &#8220;face&#8221; of the model looks down from the ceiling of what used to be his living room, with most of the mechanical works in the space above the ceiling. It is driven by a\u00a0pendulum clock, which has 9 weights or ponds. The planets move around the model in real-time, automatically. (A slight &#8220;re-setting&#8221; must be done by hand every four years to compensate for the February 29th of a\u00a0leap year.) The planetarium includes a display for the current time and date. The plank that has the year numbers written on it has to be replaced every 22 years.<br \/>\nTo create the gears for the model, 10,000 handmade nails were used. In addition to the basic orrery, there are displays of the phases of the moon and other astronomical phenomena. The orrery was constructed to a scale of 1:1,000,000,000,000 (1 millimetre: 1 million kilometres).<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/travel.sygic.com\/en\/poi\/royal-eise-eisinga-planetarium-poi:5913\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwj7ls2b7PXfAhXHGuwKHa5tCg4QjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/media-cdn.sygictraveldata.com\/media\/800x600\/612664395a40232133447d33247d383638333637393331\" alt=\"Image result for Royal Eise Eisinga Planetarium\" width=\"471\" height=\"353\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tripadvisor.com.my\/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g227917-d1066306-i175221646-Eise_Eisinga_Planetarium-Franeker_Friesland_Province.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwi687Hk7PXfAhUqsaQKHcB-A5sQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-s\/0a\/71\/ab\/8e\/planetarium-eise-eisinga.jpg\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"550\" height=\"309\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Stadhuis Franeken.<\/strong>\u00a0The Franeken city hall looks like a wedding cake.<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mutl i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.ca\/url?sa=i&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwili93d6_XfAhVhMOwKHdcZCoQQjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcommons.wikimedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFile%3AFraneker_Stadhuis_2.jpg&amp;psig=AOvVaw0BSSlpWapa0F5g-xnUTH29&amp;ust=1547849689381835\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwili93d6_XfAhVhMOwKHdcZCoQQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mut\" src=\"https:\/\/encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTN0klfyYDGqxa8Mlt_jjekdsCO7RXnp4mZn7kehutWUIJA4x9K_w\" alt=\"Image result for Stadhuis Franeker.\" width=\"269\" height=\"353\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>LEEUWARDEN\u00a0<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Fries Museum.<\/strong> In a nice new building in the city centre, this is the typical county museum displaying the local history from the Stone Age on.<br \/>\n<strong>St. Boniface Church.\u00a0<\/strong>The\u00a0Gothic Revival\u00a0church was built between 1882 and 1884.

The Dutch must be the greatest earthmovers of all time. The entire west and north of the country are protected by a dyke &#8211; 10-12 feet high in the Zuiderzee but 25 feet high on the Atlantic side. The area west and north of Amsterdam is very low-lying and a mecca for canals. Water is pumped constantly. No houses have basements in the country.<br \/>\n2. There is a dearth of lay-bys and pull-offs on all roads. Try to text or use Google Maps is difficult to find anywhere to pull off. The few that exist are packed with semi-trailers and there are no facilities, that is no bathrooms! This also means it is unlikely to find one to sleep at.<br \/>\n3. The cyclists here are the most entitled people on earth. Everyone gives them the right of way, including pedestrians. Driving is complicated as one must also look out for them. The bikes are the clunkiest, slowest looking things, but then again this is such a crowded country, and speeds are low.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Netherlands North Jan 14- 2019 After almost 4 months at home, I returned to Europe on January 14, 2019.
