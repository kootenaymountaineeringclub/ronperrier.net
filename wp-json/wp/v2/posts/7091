Up Koch Creek to Grizzly Turnoff. Then on good Grizzly road past Greasybill turnoff (5 km.), past a new cutblock where they&#8217;ve lined the road with debris to burn, and past the left-hand turnoff (14.7 km.) that would lead to cutblocks below Spiers and Airy. Instead, I go R, then R again after 100 m. into what obviously is a cut block. The road does continue on farther to Grizzly headwaters. I can drive about 700 m. into the block before deciding to park (grass growing up on the road). The Grizzly Road is 2wd high clearance, only because of water bars beyond km. 13 or so.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">I park at 10:00; that&#8217;s 1 hr. 40 min. from Nelson. By 10:15 I&#8217;m ready to go: ice axe, leather boots, good rain gear, blue polar tech pants, water bottle without water. I head straight up through the cutblock to the top in the middle where I find blue flagging, probably the same that Rowell told me of. Then, I just head &#8216;er straight up through very open timber. My altimeter at the truck said 5920-5980&#8217;. I&#8217;m surprised at how soon the terrain flattens out; also interesting that I cross many dry water courses flowing to the L. I&#8217;m still in trees at 6500&#8242; when the ground is pretty well covered with snow. I fill my water bottle with it.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\"> Eventually, I see a bump ahead, the 7200&#8242; hump at 323-870. On top of this, I sit down with my map (can&#8217;t see much) and decide rightly that Stanley is to the N. The flat-topped thing to the SW is u\/n 7400&#8242; (317-862). I continue NW (steep cliffs on my R to a 7500&#8242; bump with a small cairn built by Rowell as it turns out. I descend a few hundred feet (trees right up to the ridge on the SW side &amp; bare rock on the other) then plod the last 300-400&#8242; over easy broken rock (there are even traces of a trail to the top by 12:53&#8211;call it 1 hr. 40 min. from the truck. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">It has been a No-hands climb. There&#8217;s a big, flat-topped cairn; a good thing since I can see virtually nothing. As I lunch, the mist lifts a bit, &amp; I see Arrow Lake, Ladybird &amp; Cayuse Creeks, a very attractive basin below to the N. with two lakes, and the flat-topped 7600&#8242; peak just to the W that Rowell says is Shell Mtn. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">After 25 min. I head down (cold &amp; windy on top). The return is easy, but I do get too far S. in the timber &amp; get into a bit of bushwhacking. Using my altimeter, I surmise my cutblock is to my L, and sure enough I see it about 40 m. to the side. I come out right on a horizontal skid trail and walk to right above the truck (which I can&#8217;t see), returning at 1:40. That&#8217;s a 3 hr. 25 min. day and a 1 hr. 25 min. descent. The key to a better descent is to use the L edge of the cut block across the valley as a visual reference.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Back to Nelson by 3:30. Never got rained on. For Spiers, I surmise taking off from the first or second switchback to the R on the road across the valley. First S\/B may lead into the bush, but it does give access to Spiers&#8217; SW ridge. Second S\/B avoids bush but may lead to cliffs. Anyway, it should give access to Spiers&#8217; SE ridge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\"><strong>MOUNT STANLEY<\/strong> 2371m August 24, 2014 by Steve Miros\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">This trip was an attempt at a new, possibly easier ascent of Mt. Stanley. Previous club trips have been from either the Grizzly Creek FSR (approaching the mountain from the east) or the Greasybill FSR ( from the northwest). <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">This access was from Syringa Creek Provincial Park on the Deer Creek FSR. At approximately km 18 there is a junction where the well-marked FSR leaves its westerly direction to the community of Deer Park and turns right (north) . Continue on the Deer Creek MAIN FSR to its end for 35 km which puts you exactly at the foot of a large avalanche gently sloped chute leading right up to the actual summit. There was a very nice wood-crafted Mt Stanley sign nailed to a tree. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">We first dropped 100 ft down to cross the creek and then began the trod straight up the avalanche chute. Light to occasionally very heavy rain accompanied us. Needless to say, the temptation to turn back was strong. About 2\/3s of the way up we began to enter alpine openings and easy scree that kept us out of the wet shrubbery. The sun came out during the last leg of the scramble drying out our clothes.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">We had great views in all directions. A trip 2 years previous by Vicky H and Sandra McG was the last registered ascent. With a visual forecast of no rain in the near future which is what we began up with, we descended through meadows on the eastern slope eventually working our way through the lower basin\u2019s huckleberry-infested underbrush where we were met by a bear in the parking lot. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Total time was about 4 hours and we are as of yet undecided if this was the better of the 3 routes. But, it was definitely an interesting one.\u00a0 <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Steven Miros<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>MOUNT STANLEY 2371m 7779\u2019 There are 3 ways to access Mt Stanley: from the north up Grizzly Creek FSR to approach from the east, up Greasybill FSR to approach from the NW or up Little Cayuse Creek FSR to approach &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2017\/10\/11\/mount-stanley\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-7091","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-uncategorized"],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p2Ncip-1Qn","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7091","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7091"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7091\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":25268,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7091\/revisions\/25268"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7091"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7091"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7091"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
