A logging road new in 1996 goes up the NE fork of Glacier Creek to the 6000-foot level. To access Starbird Pass (8000&#8242;): go straight up the creek, the slide alder is not too bad and go around the headwall of Mt Monica on a goat trail to get to Starbird Pass. A good campsite is 150&#8242; above the pass at 8700&#8242;. Walk 3 km across the Starbird neve and climb a 1000&#8242; couloir in the SW face and an easy scramble up the summit ridge.<br \/>\nDescent: A much faster route (and what should be considered a good ascent route) is to go SW to the 9100&#8242; low spot in the ridge that forms the west extremity of the neve 204-894. A quick 2500&#8242; descent leads to the northern tributary of Glacier Creek and then a short bushwhack down the bottom of the creek to your vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>A 1983 trip approached from Howser Creek\/Tea Creek &#8211; park 5000&#8242;.
