A\u00a0heavy, silvery\u00a0d-block\u00a0element, mercury is the only metallic element that is liquid at\u00a0standard conditions for temperature and pressure; the only other element that is liquid under these conditions is the\u00a0halogen\u00a0bromine, though metals such as\u00a0caesium,\u00a0gallium, and\u00a0rubidium\u00a0melt just above\u00a0room temperature.<br \/>\nMercury occurs in deposits throughout the world mostly as\u00a0cinnabar\u00a0(mercuric sulfide).
