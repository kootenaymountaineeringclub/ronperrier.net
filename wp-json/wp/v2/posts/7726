Our eyes were on the two presumably unclimbed peaks north of Mohican Mtn. and at the headwaters of Gainer Creek.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">As usual, we drove to the northernmost point of Gainer Creek road just south of Bunker Hill Creek (still 2WD low clearance all the way; GR 791-165). From this point, we hiked in Wed. afternoon, Sept. 11, to set up a high camp. The approach is of some interest, especially since it is seasonally sensitive. Here goes. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Follow the old road (ATV only) on foot along the west side of Gainer to a point just below Badshot Mtn. (55 min. with full packs; 795-184). Cross to the east bank of Gainer on the Mohican Mine road and immediately leave the road to head north through a boulder field. As the boulder field disappears, head toward the creek and walk in the bed (likely possible only at low water season; even dry rocks are very slippery). Alternate between the creek bed and west bank as needed until you reach an obvious cascade\/falls (clearly visible from afar; 808-198). Look carefully from a spot (this year a big snow tongue of avvy debris) at the bottom of the falls; you should be able to make out a hunter\u2019s track\/game trail on the east bank. Follow this to the top of the falls through dense slide alder and along slippery vegetation on steep slopes above the canyon. The valley is narrow at the falls and choked with alder right to the valley walls; this is the best route. Once through the falls, traverse carefully to the west bank and continue up through alps to find a level campsite. We had to work a bit to find a really good one on the east bank near the creek at 1960 m. (2 \u00f3 hours from the truck: GR 812-204).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">By the way, the fabled Grizzly Notch looks awful\u2014steep and choked with vegetation, and probably bears.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">On Thursday, we went first to u\/n 2580, getting away at the salubrious hour of 7:30 (well, it was mid-September). The peak is clearly visible from the campsite. Here is the best, and maybe only feasible, route. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">From camp, head south up alps, scree, and snow to join the prominent NW ridge at its base (clearly visible from camp; there\u2019s also a more westerly NW ridge\u2014very chaucy and studded with rotten towers; singularly unappetizing). Staying on the south side of an unnamed glacier, ascend grotty slopes, hugging the head-high ice at the tongue and edge; then pass left of a rock fin by walking in the moat next to the glacier. Almost immediately, zig right on snow to join and follow a prominent shingly ridge leading to the base of the sub-peak northeast of the objective. Scramble the west side of the sub-peak (definitely loose and rotten) and either pass over the top or traverse it on the right (south) to gain the col between it and the objective. From there, scramble the northeast face of u\/n 2580 on loose limestone (15 min.). <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">We found a dilapidated cairn on the summit, possibly built by a miner, but no record (1 hr. 50 min. up from camp). We did put in a proper KMC summit tube record. The summit ridge is along, a thin NW-SE blade; approaches from the south, unlike Mohican, look suicidal\u2014loose and very steep.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">After a break, we decided to traverse the long, meandering ridge north to the base of u\/n 2600. Beginning at 10:00, we descended u\/n 2580 back to the col (care needed; exposed and fairly steep), went to the top of the sub-peak, and decided we didn\u2019t fancy down climbing its steeper and looser-looking north ridge. Instead, we descended the west face of the sub-peak (moderately desperate in places) to a bench almost level with the highest, narrow tongue of the glacier. We worked our way up to the ridge north of the sub-peak on snow and along a moat. Next, we embarked on the ridge traverse, following a serpentine of limestone and dirt up and down, in pleasant 4th class scrambling, to reach the base of u\/n 2600 by 12:00. After a snack, we dumped our packs and enjoyed a pleasant 20 min. ascent on heather, broken rock, and solid quartzite slabs. Perhaps the most solid Badshots peak I have been on. On top by 12:30 (2 \u00f3 hours from the summit of u\/n 2580), we built a cairn and put in a record in a film can. I had imagined the flat-topped summit to be as wide as a football field, but in reality, it\u2019s only about 20\u2019 wide. Paul explored an exit to the northwest toward the u\/n 2520 flanking our objective (817-213). You could get down to the wide col, but ascending the SE buttress of the objective requires scaling rotten, overhanging junk. This peak (if it is one) can easily be climbed via alp land on the SW.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">From the summit of u\/n 2600, we descended to the col at its base again. From that point (821-207), we followed a long couloir of loose rock down and west to the alpine a few hundred meters above camp, an effective but not perfect descent route. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Back in camp by 2:20 (1 hr. 20 min. down from summit), we packed up and by 3:00 were underway for the walkout. We retraced our steps, finding the waterfall portion easier than expected, and reached the truck at 5:10 pm. (2 hrs. 10 min. to hike out; 9 hour 40 min. day). <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Perfect weather for the whole trip.

Templeman or Abbott Pk. for a weekend in the Hall-Healey Pass area. Razor&#8217;s Edge, part of the limestone dike that passes through the Badshot Range, presents an awe-inspiring, though rotten, SW face that drops over 3,000&#8242; to the headwaters of Hall Creek. It was first climbed by Kenneth and Pym Karcher in August 1950. Hamish Mutch and I climbed it last Labor Day weekend and suspect that no one had done it in the intervening 45 years.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Did I hear road access again? Yes, that&#8217;s it. Now that the Healey Creek road is once more open, you can drive right to the height of land (6,600&#8242;) at km. 25. From the Lardeau River road turn off just a few kilometres S. of Gerard and immediately cross the river via a gated bridge (seemingly always unlocked). Follow the 4WD road past such Badshot landmarks as Butler&#8217;s Disco and Rick&#8217;s Ranch through the pass and about .7 km. beyond to the N. to a point where boulders on the road stop even the most serious driver. Fred likes to reminisce that he and Paul Allen were able to drive right onto the glacier to the N.; the road still does cross the glacier, but you&#8217;ll need footpower, a motorcycle, or a mountain bike to get there.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Anyway, follow the road to some mine workings and ascend moraines and snow to the Similarity-Razor&#8217;s Edge col (8,700&#8242;). Then simply follow the NW ridge of Razor&#8217;s Edge, a long rising sweep of limestone, to the summit in 90 min. It&#8217;s a class 4 scramble with some exposure on the SW side and a heart-stopping 2,500&#8242; drop-off on the NE. There&#8217;s a kind of crux when the ridge steepens near the end. From a cleft in the ridge avoid a steep wall of rotten limestone by descending 5-10&#8242; on the left, traversing 30&#8242;, and re-gaining the ridge. The rest is easy. Return to the col via the ascent route. No rope was used on the approach or mountain.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">This peak could easily be combined with a plod-up Similarity Mtn. (9,370&#8242;), a 25 min. walk-up easy snow slopes. Figure on about 7 1\/2 hours for both peaks round trip from your vehicle. Some parties may want to carry a rope for Razor&#8217;s Edge.<br \/>\nKim Kratky<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em><strong>ABBOTT PEAK\u00a0 \u00a0<\/strong><\/em>2961m\u00a0 \u00a09715&#8242;\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>Abbott Peak is east of Healy Creek, at the heads of Hall and Lake Creeks.

Hamish and I looked at Aldridge from the summit of Similarity and thought it to be laughable because of its unimpressive profile and low elevation. Nevertheless, it surprised us by offering a moderately challenging series of ups and downs requiring almost 9 hours of our time.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Aldridge is located SW of Mt. Abbott and E. of the headwaters of Lake Creek. Access is again easy. At km. 24.5 on the Healey Creek road, turn E. and S. onto the Abbott Mine road. This can be driven for about 2.5 km. From this point, walk to the Abbott Mine site (20-30 min.), ascend an obvious snow tongue to the E., and continue R or S. on scree and moraine until you reach the upper Sierra Creek basin. Here you will find a disused road leading to a col at the base of Aldridge&#8217;s NE ridge (891-068); the picturesque tarn and lunar landscape are arresting.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Here the climb begins. Start the NE ridge with easy scrambling which leads to a big platform. Pass the platform on the L. or E., descending to a notch via gritty slabs and scree. From the notch, ascend a big buttress or tower directly, using a large flake to work up a cleft and regain the ridge. Continue scrambling to the next high point and descend to the second major notch. Gain the second notch by going down a tricky flake and a short, exposed gully on the L, followed by steep, solid ribs and slabs (Class 4). From this notch, descend a gully of loose scree to the R. or W. of the ridge, traverse, and regain the ridge on poor quality rock Continue on solid rock, with ups and downs, to the top, about 5 hrs. up. Thanks to Earle Whipple for helping me re-work this portion of the description.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The big attraction of Aldridge was that we thought it was unclimbed; and indeed we seem to have made the first ascent, as we found no cairn on the summit. However, approaches from &#8220;Aldridge Lakes&#8221; to the E. of the peak would be an easy walk-up via the E. and S. ridges. Since there has been so much mining activity in the area it&#8217;s possible the peak had been climbed&#8211;but not, we think, by the NE ridge. Aldridge provides excellent views of the Lake Creek canyon and of a desolate landscape of alps dotted by lakes stretching out to the S.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Our party returned to the truck via the ascent route in 3 1\/4 hrs., although descending to the lakes via the S. and E. would be dead easy. No ice axe was needed beyond the snow slopes above the mine for this trip in September, and we left the rope in the truck.

Access to the area is limited to ATV transport up the Healy Creek Road for a distance of 25 km. A spur road leads to the mine workings of the Abbott property (elevation 6,900 ft.). From here the hiking distance south to a lake near the headwaters of Lake Creek and at the base of Mount Aldridge is about 6 km. The best route to the summit is the arc-shaped ridge from the south end of the lake and then in a northwesterly and northerly direction. Only the last 200 feet (60 meters) is a scramble. Weather was a factor when we experienced a blizzard at 8,300 feet. Conditions improved and our second attempt was successful in building a cairn and placing a KMC register on the summit at a GPS elevation of 8,802 feet (2,683 meters).
