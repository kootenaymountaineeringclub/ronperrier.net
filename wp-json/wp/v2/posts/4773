But next month Mr Furutachi will be gone. He is one of three heavyweight presenters leaving prime-time shows on relatively liberal channels. It is no coincidence that all are, by Japanese standards, robust critics of the government.<br \/>\nLast year another anchor, Shigetada Kishii, used his news slot on TBS, a rival channel, to question the legality of bills passed to expand the nation\u2019s military role overseas. The questioning was nothing less than what most constitutional scholars were also doing\u2014and in private senior officials themselves acknowledge the unconstitutionality of the legislation, even as they justify it on the ground that Japan is in a risky neighbourhood and needs better security. But Mr Kishii\u2019s on-air fulminations prompted a group of conservatives to take out newspaper advertisements accusing him of violating broadcasters\u2019 mandated impartiality. TBS now says he will quit. The company denies this has anything to do with the adverts, but few believe that.<\/p>\n<p>The third case is at NHK, the country\u2019s giant public-service broadcaster. It has yanked one of its more popular anchors off the air. Hiroko Kuniya has helmed an investigative programme, \u201cClose-up Gendai\u201d, for two decades. NHK has not said why she is leaving, but colleagues blame her departure on an interview last year with Yoshihide Suga, the government\u2019s top spokesman and closest adviser to Shinzo Abe, the prime minister.<br \/>\nMr Suga is known for running a tight ship and for demanding advance notice of questions from journalists. In the interview Ms Kuniya had the temerity to probe him on the possibility that the new security legislation might embroil Japan in other countries\u2019 wars. By the standards of spittle-flecked clashes with politicians on British or American television, the encounter was tame. But Japanese television journalists rarely play hardball with politicians. Mr Suga\u2019s handlers were incensed.<\/p>\n<p>It all shows how little tolerance the government has for criticism, says Makoto Sataka, a commentator and colleague of Mr Kishii\u2019s. He points out that one of Mr Abe\u2019s first moves after he returned to power in 2012 was to appoint conservative allies to NHK\u2019s board. Katsuto Momii, the broadcaster\u2019s new president, wasted little time in asserting that NHK\u2019s role was to reflect government policy. What is unprecedented today, says Shigeaki Koga, a former bureaucrat turned talking head, is the growing public intimidation of journalists. On February 9th the communications minister, Sanae Takaichi, threatened to close television stations that flouted rules on political impartiality. Ms Takaichi was responding to a question about the departure of the three anchors.<\/p>\n<p>Political pressure on the press is not new. The mainstream media (the five main newspapers are affiliated with the principal private television stations) are rarely analytical or adversarial, being temperamentally and commercially inclined to reflect the establishment view. Indeed the chumminess is extreme. In January Mr Abe again dined with the country\u2019s top media executives at the offices of the Yomiuri Shimbun, the world\u2019s biggest-circulation newspaper. Nine years ago, when Mr Abe resigned from his first term as prime minister, the paper\u2019s kingpin, Tsuneo Watanabe, brokered the appointment of his successor, Yasuo Fukuda. Mr Watanabe then attempted to forge a coalition between ruling party and opposition. Oh, but his paper forgot to alert readers to all these goings-on. The media today, says Michael Cucek of Temple University in Tokyo, has \u201cno concept of conflict of interest.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It has all contributed to an alarming slide since 2011 in Japan\u2019s standing in world rankings of media freedom. Mr Koga expects a further fall this year. He ran afoul of the government during his stint as a caustic anti-Abe commentator on \u201cHodo Station\u201d. On air last year he claimed that his contract was being terminated because of pressure from the prime minister\u2019s office. His aim, Mr Koga insists, was to rally the media against government interference. Yet TV Asahi apologised and promised tighter controls over guests. Now Mr Furutachi is quitting too. The government is playing chicken with the media, Mr Furutachi says, and winning.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Anchors away &#8211; Criticism of government is being airbrushed out of news shows Feb 20th 2016 Economist For a decade, millions of Japanese have tuned in to watch Ichiro Furutachi, the salty presenter of a popular evening news show, TV &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2016\/03\/18\/no-media-freedom\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-4773","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-uncategorized"],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p2Ncip-1eZ","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4773","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4773"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4773\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4773"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4773"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4773"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
