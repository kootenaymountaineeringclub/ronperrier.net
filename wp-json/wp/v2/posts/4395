While we think we know what we want, we\u2019re often wrong. With algorithms, online-dating services initially tried to find matches bases almost exclusively on what clients said they wanted. But it became apparent that the kind of partner they wanted (age, religion, hair color and the like) did not match up with the kind of partner they were actually interested in. <\/p>\n<p><strong>What Matters and What Doesn\u2019t.<\/strong> Online dating is a circus of self-deception.<br \/>\nA. There are the things that people don\u2019t want to matter, but do like race.<br \/>\n<strong>B. Then there are the things that people want to matter, but don\u2019t.<\/strong><br \/>\n1. Profile Text. What you write about yourself in your profile text hardly makes a difference. Many personal apps have gotten rid of personal essays altogether.<br \/>\n2. Religion. No matter how important religion may be in your personal life, in online dating on mainstream sites, it is of marginal importance.  However on niche sites like JDate and ChristianMingle, religion is a core value.<br \/>\n3. Hair colour, eye colour, height, education, employment are generally irrelevant.<br \/>\n<strong>C. What Matters the Most.<\/strong><br \/>\n1. <strong>Picture.<\/strong> This has 12 times the impact of your profile text.<br \/>\n2. <strong>Smoking.<\/strong> How often one smokes is one of the very few true deal breakers.<br \/>\n3. Desire for children.<br \/>\n4. Weight.<\/p>\n<p>50% of people\u2019s preferences for faces is unique to them \u2013 even among identical twins. So what drives physical attraction if not genetics or familial upbringing?<br \/>\n<strong>Appearance.<\/strong> Beyond symmetrical features, people tend to like faces similar to ones they\u2019ve seen before, as well as those associate with positive information (like a good friend\u2019s physical characteristics).<br \/>\n<strong>Smell.<\/strong> When women sniff men\u2019s shirts, they are more attracted to odours of men whose MIC molecules (which fight disease) differed from theirs. This makes sense, since it enables the creation of more diverse, protective genes.<br \/>\n<strong>Voice.<\/strong> Women rate men with deep voices as more attractive. For men, the preference was breathiness, followed by higher voices.<br \/>\n<strong>Words.<\/strong> The words you put in your online dating profile can sometimes be important.<br \/>\nWhich words can help bolster your online dating profile to attract more interest? Creative, Healthy, Read, Surfing, Book, Lifting weights, Write, Yoga, Running, Piano, Guitar, Music, Motorcycle.<br \/>\nAll these words are positive. And they all show you\u2019re either active, artistic, or intellectual. If none really describe you, find similar ones that convey your interests. And make sure to avoid any negative words.<\/p>\n<p><strong>12 WAYS TO MAKE YOURSELF MORE ATTRACTIVE &#8211; That Have Nothing to Do with Your Appearance<\/strong><br \/>\nAll of the best suggestions move beyond simply \u201cbeing nice.\u201d Niceness, kindness, and all those other \u201cgood\u201d qualities should be the barest minimum required for being human, not just being a human who would like to date other humans. They\u2019re not necessarily things you have to do only for other people \u2014 a lot of them are things that you should do for yourself. The overall effect they\u2019ll have on your happiness and outlook will then spread to other areas of your life, including relationships.<br \/>\nSo make yourself a better person, and therefore a more attractive person in the process. We\u2019re all ongoing projects and that means we can always change. <\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Cultivate Decisiveness.<\/strong><br \/>\nStop saying \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d, \u201cWhat do you feel like doing?\u201d Besides being open to and respectful of other\u2019s suggestions, knowing what you want can be really attractive. It\u2019s a demonstrable way of displaying confidence, and therefore more useful than simply trying to \u201cbe confident\u201d (whatever that means). <\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Play to Your Strengths.<\/strong><br \/>\nFind attractive qualities in yourself &#8211; your strong points: funny, confident, talkative, nice etc etc. But it\u2019s different from person to person.<br \/>\nA person who\u2019s naturally not funny would come across as lame when being something they aren\u2019t when actually being a trustworthy person is their thing.<br \/>\nSomeone who\u2019s naturally shy would find it difficult to be talkative and that discomfort would always show. Maybe BY being mysterious, you could cultivate your shyness.<br \/>\nOnce you are onto something, the real essence is to \u201cBe Yourself\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Develop an Interesting Skill or Hobby. <\/strong><br \/>\nBe talented at something: like piano, snowboarding, painting or whatever &#8211; it speaks well of you to develop a passion and be good at it. The skill or hobby itself gives you character; and having taken the time to learn it shows that you\u2019re a go-getter.<br \/>\nHave you always wanted to learn an instrument? Take lessons or start teaching yourself. Wish you could pick locks? Get yourself a practice lock and a set of picks and hit YouTube for some tutorials. Want to be able to make at least one awesome meal? Learn how to cook that meal. The sky\u2019s the limit; all you have to do is make the time to learn. Don\u2019t do it to attract women or men &#8211; do it just for yourself.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Focus On the Other Senses Beyond Sight.<\/strong><br \/>\nUsing smell as an example: never underestimate the value of good personal hygiene. If someone smells good, it makes them 100% more attractive. <\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Look. Listen. Pay Attention.<\/strong><br \/>\nTake an interest in the other side of the conversation. Practice conversing \u2013 not only speaking but listening well and showing interest in the person talking. Not waiting for someone to finish talking and then talking more about yourself couldn\u2019t be less attractive.<br \/>\nEngage with the world, and with everyone in it. It is important to learn how to read people and adjust your behavior accordingly. <\/p>\n<p><strong>6. Learn. All the Time.<\/strong><br \/>\nRead. Read anything and everything. Rip what you read apart for knowledge and wisdom. Learn from it and let it enrich you and be a companion through all you do. Beside reading, watch and listen in order to learn. Exercise curiosity about everything; then go try to figure out the answers to all your questions. <\/p>\n<p><strong>7. Love Yourself for Who You Are.<\/strong><br \/>\nAs clich\u00e9 as it sounds, it\u2019s true: You have to love yourself before you can love anyone else. It works.<\/p>\n<p><strong>8. Grow Up.<\/strong><br \/>\nPeople who whine, or gossip non-stop, are often oblivious to social settings, dependent on others and demand to be treated as an adult. Life is hard for most of us, we don\u2019t need someone around who complains about it constantly. Some people remain single by forever complaining about how they can\u2019t find someone. It is not a way to be desired.<br \/>\nDevelop the self-awareness to understand yourself. Don\u2019t be a burden on a relationship by only considering yourself. Give to the relationship.<br \/>\nAssess situations and plan how to overcome obstacles to reach your goals. Be responsible and empathetic, but remain playful, fun, lighthearted and enjoy silly things. Smile more.<br \/>\nDeal with your responsibilities in an adult fashion by not complaining all the time or expecting everyone else to take care of your shit for you. <\/p>\n<p><strong>9. Don\u2019t Take Yourself Too Seriously All the Time.<\/strong><br \/>\nYou should be able to laugh at yourself. If you do something dumb, don\u2019t act stubborn and not admit your mistake by refusing to be embarrassed. You don\u2019t have to always be \u201ccool, just laugh at yourself and have a good time.<br \/>\nHumans are funny, even when we screw up &#8211; especially when we screw up. By laughing at your own foibles, you\u2019ll be able to deal with them better. This benefits both you and other people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>10. Learn to Express Yourself Clearly and Succinctly.<\/strong><br \/>\nCut out the \u201clikes\u201d \u201cums\u201d and \u2018you knows\u201d from your word bank. In addition to ditching \u201cfiller\u201d words from your vocabulary, also be conscious of your grammar and spelling in written communication. Messages like \u201cU so hottt!!!!\u201d are the exact opposite of hot.<\/p>\n<p><strong>11. Take Initiative.<\/strong><br \/>\nIf you hate something about yourself, try to fix it or own it. Being self depreciating  only makes others feel uncomfortable. And it makes you look like you\u2019re fishing for compliments. \u201cOh I\u2019m\u2026 ugly\u201d. What the hell am I supposed to say? I am not going to compliment you, so what are you expecting? We all have our insecurities, but by surrounding yourself with an aura of negativity, others won\u2019t want to be around you much longer.<br \/>\nAlso, you\u2019re probably not as ugly as you think you are. Take a look at the average person you see walking around everyday. Most of those people have managed to get laid.<br \/>\nWe all have flaws; to err is to be human and all that. But if there\u2019s something you wish you could change about yourself, don\u2019t just wish it \u2014 go ahead and make the change yourself.<\/p>\n<p><strong>12. Let It Go.<\/strong><br \/>\nLet go trying to be attractive. If you are trying to control how sexy you are, you only look unattractive.<br \/>\nAs an analogy, consider breathing. When you are aware of your breathing, it\u2019s harder to do as you have to do it consciously. Try breathing manually now. Did you do it? Now try to do it in auto-pilot mode. Now you can breath easily and fluently.<br \/>\nBy trying to be more attractive, you are making it hard to be attractive. It\u2019s a natural process that should be left alone. Let sexuality take over your body.<br \/>\nYou don\u2019t have to be smiling all the time, but you do have the freedom and opportunity to be attractive every day.<br \/>\nEmbrace your inner self. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>People don\u2019t always know what they want in a soul mate (it is not as easy as buying dishwashing detergent).
