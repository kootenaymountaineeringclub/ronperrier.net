It shares borders with Eritrea to the north, Djibouti to the northeast, Somalia to the east and northeast, Kenya to the south, South Sudan to the west, and Sudan to the northwest. Ethiopia has a total area of 1,100,000 square kilometres (420,000 square miles). Addis Ababa lies several kilometres west of the East African Rift that splits the country into the African and Somali tectonic plates.<br \/>\nEthiopia is the oldest independent country in Africa and the second-oldest official Christian nation in the world after Armenia. Ethiopia is also the place for the first Hijrah (615 AD) in Islamic history where the Christian king of Ethiopia accepted Muslim refugees from Mecca sent by the prophet Mohamed. Along with Liberia and Darwiish State, it was the only nation to survive the Scramble for Africa, until it was occupied by Italy and annexed to the colony of Italian East Africa, alongside Eritrea and Somalia. It was liberated during World War II and later involved in wars against Oromo and Somali rebels and the newly annexed Eritrea, whose independence led Ethiopia to return to being a landlocked country.<br \/>\nEthiopia is a multi-ethnic state with over 80 different ethnic groups. Christianity is the most widely professed faith in the country, with significant minorities of Islam and a small percentage of traditional faiths.<br \/>\nEthiopia is considered an emerging power and developing country, having the fastest economic growth in Sub-Saharan African countries because of foreign direct investment in the expansion of agricultural and manufacturing industries. However, in terms of per capita income and the Human Development Index, the country is regarded as poor with high rates of poverty, poor respect for human rights, and a literacy rate of only 49%. Agriculture is the largest economic sector in Ethiopia, accounting for 36% of the country&#8217;s gross domestic product as of 2020.<br \/>\nThe people are beautiful, with dozens of cultures but one of the worst for begging and annoyances. Viewed as a walking lottery ticket, they follow you, begging for money and shouting, &#8220;you you you! money money money&#8221;<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nCapital. <\/strong>Addis Ababa<br \/>\n<strong>Area<\/strong>1,127,127km\u00b2 Water: 7,444km\u00b2, Land: 1,119,683km\u00b2<em><br \/>\n<\/em><strong>Population. <\/strong>113.5 million (2nd in Africa)<br \/>\n<strong>Language. <\/strong>Amharic (official), Oromo, Tigrinya Guaragigna, Somali, Arabic, other local languages, English (major foreign language taught in schools)<br \/>\n<strong>Religion. <\/strong>Ethiopian Orthodox, Protestantism, Catholicism, Islam, Judaism, Animism, Baha&#8217;i<br \/>\n<strong>Country code<\/strong>+251<br \/>\n<strong>Electrical Plug.<\/strong> European 2-prong<\/p>\n<p><strong>Visa. <\/strong>Virtually all but local countries need a visa obtained as an e-visa.

Because of inflation, withdraw relatively small amounts. Ethiopia hoards US dollars and financial institutions it\u2019s illegal to give any out. May get some at the National Bank of Ethiopia, providing proof of future departure and hours of endless paperwork.<br \/>\nEthiopia is a black market money country but this is not well advertised, illegal and people are arrested for doing it. If you withdraw money from an ATM, you immediately lose the difference between the official and black market rates.<br \/>\nBuy birr at 64-70\/US$ at the airport and 80-90 birr\/US$ on the street (if you can find someone or have a friend with connections). Buy US$ at 110 birr\/US$.<br \/>\nAt the Lalibala Stone churches, where the entry ticket is US$50, they had only euros which they wouldn&#8217;t accept. A guide working in the office offered to exchange it for me. I got 57 EB for it but he exchanged it on the black market and made 2,100 birr, a nice profit of $40. He wouldn&#8217;t share.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Getting a vehicle into Ethiopia<\/strong><br \/>\nCrossing the border into Ethiopia from Sudan or Kenya since October 2022 has become impossible as Ethiopia has stopped the Temporary Import Permit system and now requires paying a new import tax per vehicle of varying amounts of US$ 25,000 to $82,000 to $100,00 or 500% tax on the value of the vehicle (even old cars). It will not be refunded. Motor vehicles such as cars and motorcycles have to pay. Bicycles without motors pay or are fined $40 or around 2,000 Birr. Electric vehicles do not pay. The traveller writing the post had bought in Egypt a &#8217;02 inline 4-cylinder diesel Mitsubishi Pajero.<br \/>\nThe Ethiopian Customs Commission (ECC ) decided to implement this law to restrict the illegal selling of vehicles by &#8220;wealthy&#8221; Ethiopians who drive cars to Ethiopia as tourists under a temporary import permit (free), sell the cars, and make a killing because cars are 2-3 times the value here. Officially, the law is temporary, but how temporary is anyone&#8217;s guess?<br \/>\nA CDP doesn\u2019t work.<br \/>\nWorkarounds:<br \/>\n1. People are trying to ship their vehicles from or to any East African port to Saudi Arabia &#8211; a ferry from Port Sudan to Jeddah to ship by container to Mombasa. Cost \u20ac3600 all charges included.<br \/>\n2. The Ministry of Tourism may allow you to work with a local tour operator to give letters granting passage to pass through each region to customs. The local tour operator is responsible for the vehicle, thus waiving the payment. Start with a letter from the Ethiopian Tour Guides. Paying a tour guide cost depends on where you go and what you barter but $150 to $40\/day for the guide\/tour agency for taking responsibility of the car. To see more of Ethiopia it would be 12-15 days or around $1200-1500.<\/p>\n<p><strong>OBSERVATIONS on ETHIOPIA\u00a0<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>1. People.<\/strong> Ethiopians are different-looking Africans &#8211; small, finer-boned, not many tall people, chocolate colouring, narrow faces with narrow noses, women have small bums, little or no obesity. Women don&#8217;t use attachments, false eyelashes or long fingernails. It would appear that Ethiopian hair doesn&#8217;t have as much curl as many women have straight hairstyles.\u00a0 There is a lot of poverty in Addis Ababa &#8211; homeless, more begging than anywhere else I have ever travelled (elderly, women with babies, children as young as 2, guys wanting cigarettes). Many have their hand out;&#8221;Give X&#8221;.<br \/>\n<strong>2. Cost.<\/strong> Relatively cheap. The hostel I am staying in is $8 for a dorm room, and $12 for a private but with no BF. Food is inexpensive.<br \/>\n<strong>3. Food.<\/strong> Small coffee shops are next to the sidewalk everywhere. Small charcoal braziers heat coffee in tall pots and serve it in tiny cups. Sugar but not milk is offered. Hamburgers and pizza are available but there are no fast-food chains. Many food venues are tiny and there are few large restaurants. Large food stores are rare, most are tiny shops with a counter and the seller gets your product. Milk is only available in 1\/2 litre plastic bags or powdered and no UHT milk in cartons. If alone, menus are hard to navigate as there are no descriptions and some are only in Amharic.<br \/>\n<strong>4. Stores.<\/strong> There are no large shopping malls. AA has two large markets typical of African markets with few products of interest to foreigners. Mercato is pure bedlam and stretches for blocks &#8211; finding the actual market is confusing. Products are sold all together &#8211; one area for shoes, women&#8217;s clothing, housewear, jewelry, carpet, luggage, and drapery.<br \/>\nClothing stores have a huge number of mannikens outside.<br \/>\n<strong>5. Transportation.<\/strong> Besides taxis, most locals travel in cheap share vans (10-30 cents per ride depending on distance. They travel fixed routes &#8211; I follow Google Maps and get off when they turn off your route and then find another van. Sometimes rides last a few hundred yards, sometimes 5+ km. Unlike other places, they congregate at turn-around points &#8211; take the front van as they leave only when full and they cram people in.<br \/>\nI haven&#8217;t been able to figure out the buses and didn&#8217;t take one. I walk a lot.<br \/>\nDomestic flights are the cheapest in the world and are heavily used by the locals as distances are big and roads are not always very good. If you fly into or out of the country, Ethiopian Airlines flights are 50% off the already very cheap fares.<br \/>\n<strong>6. Traveling with Chinese tourists.<\/strong> Chinese are the most disliked tourists. I had no previous experience but had a group of six join us for the tour to the Afar.<br \/>\n<em>a. Social.<\/em> They are not socially competent people and never initiate conversation. You can ask them many questions but they rarely show any interest in you. If a group, they sit together, speak Mandarin and don&#8217;t participate with other tourists.<br \/>\n<em>b. Photos.<\/em> We were at one of the most marvelous natural attractions in Ethiopia in the world but it became almost impossible for anyone to take a picture of it without having a Chinese posing in the photo. There were 3 groups of two and each took many photos of the other trading places. It took forever for them to clear. I asked if they could allow some of us to take photos, and they got irritated and said &#8220;We have all day, we don&#8217;t have to be at the volcano till 8 pm&#8221;. We had limited time with an onerous drive and started hiking at 5:30.<br \/>\n<em>c. Food.<\/em> When your food arrives, be early as they pay no attention to the needs of others and fill their plates.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ETHIOPIA &#8211; ADDIS ABABA<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 1<\/strong> Wed Dec 20<br \/>\n<em>Flight:<\/em> Ethiopian Airlines Khartoum to Addis Ababa KRT-ADD 11:25-14:30.<br \/>\nI arrived, used an ATM to withdraw money and bought an Ethio-Telecom SIM with unlimited data for 1 month for 1050 birr ~$21 (relatively expensive). It was advertised that there were mini-buses from the airport, but there were only taxis. I ended up walking about 1 km to find share vans near my hostel then walked.<br \/>\nON Mad Vervet Hostel. The only hostel in Addis was cheap at $8 for a dorm room and $12 for a private. The rooms were perfectly adequate but we had no water most of the time. They arrange tours to Afar and Omo.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nADDIS ABABA\u00a0<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Day 2<\/strong> Thur Dec 21. I used share vans (5-15 birr) and walked to see the following.<br \/>\n<strong>Shola Market.<\/strong> A huge market under corrugated roofs. Everything is in sections &#8211; shoes, clothing and a small produce section. All local goods are of not much interest to a foreigner.<br \/>\n<strong>Lion Park.<\/strong> In the Anbessa Gibi Park are lions, various apes like gorillas, and birds like eagles, but it is very depressing as the animals appear ill. 100 EP<br \/>\n<strong>Yekatit 12 Monument. <\/strong>In a roundabout, this is an obelisk with several metal statues. It commemorates victims of Italian reprisals following an attempt to kill Marshal Rodolfo Graziani, marchese di Neghelli, Viceroy of Italian East Africa, on 19 February 1937, or Yekatit 12 in the Ethiopian calendar. It is located in the centre of Sidist Kilo (Amharic, &#8220;Six Kilometre&#8221;) Square, also called &#8220;Yekatit 12 Square&#8221;.<br \/>\n<strong>Ethnological Museum.<\/strong> In Haile Selasse&#8217;s former palace, it has an eclectic collection on two floors. Labelling is erratic. Visit H.S&#8221; apartment with a turquoise blue bathroom. 200 EP<br \/>\n<strong>St. George&#8217;s Cathedral.<\/strong> Ethiopian Orthodox, octagonal in shape, and a central altar area under a big dome surrounded by two corridors. I waited an hour for it to open at 2 pm. Many devotees kissed the gates and walls and prayed. Inside there was a lot of incense and people wearing shawls.<br \/>\nThe new church was built on the ruins of an older church from the 15th century. It was named after St. George after the Tabot (Ark) of the church was carried to the Battle of Adwa against the Italians during which the Ethiopians secured victory. The Italian Fascist authorities set the building on fire in 1937. The cathedral was later restored by Emperor Haile Selassie following the liberation in 1941.<br \/>\nEmpress Zewditu was crowned at this Cathedral in 1917, and Emperor Haile Selassie was crowned there in 1930, and it became a pilgrimage site for Rastafarians. The Cathedral has a museum, and an Imperial throne is on display as are the stained glass works of artist Afewerk Tekle. Given the reason why the cathedral was named, it displays weaponry used in the wars against the Italians including curved swords and tridents and giant helmets made from the manes of lions.<br \/>\n<strong>The Africa Unbound Museum.<\/strong> A private museum developed by a lovely woman, it presents a humanitarian view of the world. All in English and seen with a guide. Have a coffee on the veranda where I talked with the owner. 400 SP<br \/>\n<strong>Derg Monument<\/strong> (Tiglachin monument), is a massive, 50 m tall triangular monument with a Soviet star on top and a gold hammer and sickle crest.<br \/>\n<strong>Monument to the Lion of Judah.<\/strong> In a triangular roundabout, a lion with a crown and a Coptic lance sits on a stone plinth.<br \/>\n<strong>Meskel Square.<\/strong> A large half-oval square lined with bleachers at the back. The square itself is empty.<br \/>\n<strong>Red Terror Martyrs Memorial Museum.<\/strong> In the NM The Dark Side series, it was established in 2010 as a memorial to those who died during the Red Terror\u00a0under the\u00a0Derg\u00a0government. The museum has displays of torture instruments, skulls and bones, coffins, bloody clothes and photographs of victims. In free tours of the museum, guides show the history leading up to the Red Terror (starting from Haile Selassie&#8217;s 80th birthday celebration), the actions taken toward citizens who opposed the Derg, how the prisoners were treated and how they secretly communicated among each other.<br \/>\nThe Ethiopian Red Terror was a violent political repression campaign of the Derg against other competing Marxist-Leninist groups in Ethiopia and present-day Eritrea from 1976 to 1978. The Qey Shibir was an attempt to consolidate Derg rule during the political instability after their overthrow of Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974 and the subsequent Ethiopian Civil War. The Qey Shibir was based on the Red Terror of the Russian Civil War, and most visibly took place after Mengistu Haile Mariam became chairman of the Derg on 3 February 1977. It is estimated that 10,000 to 750,000 people were killed for the Qey Shibir. In 2007 and 2008, Mengistu was convicted <em>in absentia<\/em>\u00a0by Ethiopia for his role in the Qey Shibir while leader of the Derg.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 3<\/strong> Fri Dec 22<br \/>\nI had another walk about today trying to see some of the accessible sites I had missed on my first day.<br \/>\n<strong>Medhane Alem Cathedral.<\/strong> This large church has a big dome and iconoclast covered in frescoes. The stained glass is not stained but coloured and fading with the sun. Again there was a heavy smell of incense, people kissing the walls and many reading their Bibles in the church. They are a devout bunch.<br \/>\n<strong>Merkato Market.<\/strong> It&#8217;s hard to know where this starts and ends as there is an active market for blocks around, a mess of trucks unloading stuff, human mules carrying impossibly large loads and a lot of people. The market I was directed to has stores opening onto the streets. The goods are only of interest to the locals.<br \/>\n<em>There were two long share van rides to here. Then I walked to the museum, cathedral, palace and down to Meskel Square where I got a share van to within a km of my hostel.<\/em> <em>This was another big walking day.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<strong>National Museum of Ethiopia.<\/strong> The basement has one of the best descriptions of the evolution of Homo sapiens. It all started about 7 million years ago with bipedalism that allowed them to come out of trees. Of course there is much on Lucy and the many other sapiens precursors mostly in Ethiopia, but also throughout Africa. The first floor has national costumes and some ethnography. A well-done museum. 50 EP<br \/>\n<strong>Holy Trinity Cathedral.<\/strong> The entire front steps had a ceremony happening with guys in gold and white robes under umbrellas so the church could not be entered. Surprisingly this church charged an entrance fee of 300 EP.<br \/>\n<strong>Unity Park.<\/strong> Unity Park is located in the premises of the <strong>Grand Palace<\/strong> and it is composed of various historical, natural and cultural sites. The Grand Palace was established in 1887 and has served as the living and working space of seven Ethiopian leaders. The palace covers an area of 40 hectares and contains myriads of historical buildings and plants that date back to the time of Emperor Menelik II. The palace can&#8217;t be visited.<br \/>\n==============================================================<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 <\/strong>Sat Dec 24<em><br \/>\n<\/em><strong>ETHIOPIA &#8211; AFAR <\/strong>(Semera)<em><br \/>\n<\/em><strong>Borders: <\/strong>Djibouti-Ethiopia, Eritrea-Ethiopia<em><br \/>\nUp at 04:30, we got a taxi at 5 to the airport. I had arranged a 3-day tour through the hostel for $450.<br \/>\nFlight: <\/em>Ethiopian Air: ADD &#8211; SZE 07:00 &#8211; 09:00. 65$<\/p>\n<p>We were met by our tour operator and taken to their compound for brunch and coffee. Then with 9 others, piled into four Land Cruisers for the 300km, 6-hour drive. The other tourists were Britto (an Indian from Kerala working in fintech in Germany, Orim, an Indian from Chennai working in IT in Kigali Rwanda, and Dennis, from Kenya in our car: a Ukranian living in Belarus and an Ethiopian actor living in Addis. The other 6 were Chinese, three living in Nairobi, one in Barcelona and a man living in Salt Lake with his mother from Beijing. Initially flat r0cky desert with dead grass (in the dry season), we eventually went through land covered with basalt volcanic fields. We passed many camels and tiny settlements of locals with domes and homes with a wood frame covered with tarps and burlap. Small wattle enclosures were for their goats. Several round cairns of rock were common. A high range of rock mountains was on our right.<br \/>\nThe long drive went through an amazing variety of terrain initially on good pavement, then a concrete highway constructed by the Chinese to access the salt. The concrete ended just past a cement plant (with Chinese characters) and we entered an area of ah-ah lava &#8211; very rough broken ground and slow going for about 20 km. The road started again on an incredible raised bed with intermittent constructed cement culverts. The cement roadbed was intermittent with one lane finished, occasionally two lanes and often detours around areas of construction. There were immense lava fields most pua-pua lava. A few mountains were in the distance. We stopped at an area of sand and the wind blew the sand covering everything. It was a mistake to get out as we were immediately covered in the fine grit. Then there was an immense flat with many braided roads and fast driving.<br \/>\nWe eventually reached an Afar village where we spent the night. The homes were constructed of rough thin poles draped with nylon tarps and very rough. The Afar are very thin-faced people. It was hard to imagine what their existence was &#8211; a few goats, camels, and not much else.\u00a0 On the way, small groups seemed to appear out of nowhere. Dinner was tea, a soup with small pasta and vegetables and pasta (not very satisfying. The information from our guide was zero.<br \/>\nWe slept on wood bed frames and mattresses. I was very comfortable with my silk sleep sheet and bag but it was warm most of the night.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 5<\/strong> Sun Dec 25<br \/>\nOn one of my unusual Christmas days, we were up at 5 for a BF of Cream of Wheat, scrambled eggs and tea. Then we drove north towards Eritrea, to an immense salt flat in an area called Dallol. Initially hard crystalline, we stopped at the edge of the water covering the salt about 1-2&#8243; deep.<br \/>\nWe then continued to drive over the huge plain, white changed to brown with many heaves in small concentric areas and arrived at the main attraction, a dome of active volcanic action. We climbed gently up to a large flat area with salt pools coloured bright yellow from the sulphur and brown from iron, bubbling water through tiny salt domes and areas of bright yellow sulphur &#8220;flowers&#8221;.<br \/>\nDallol is a unique terrestrial hydrothermal System around a cinder cone of a volcano in the Danakil Depression known for its unearthly colours, mineral patterns and very acidic fluids that discharge from its hydrothermal springs.<\/p>\n<div class=\"PageBuilder-containerFluidWidths PageBuilder-pageRow\">\n<div class=\"PageBuilder-col-9 PageBuilder-col PageBuilder-article\">\n<div data-test=\"articleInlineMedia-0\" data-analytics=\"SpecialReportArticle-articleInlineMedia-4-0\">\n<div id=\"SpecialReportArticle-ArticleInlineMedia-4\" class=\"InlineImage-imageEmbed\" data-test=\"InlineImage\">\n<div class=\"InlineImage-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"InlineImage-imagePlaceholder\">\n<div>\n<div class=\"InlineImage-imageContainer\" tabindex=\"-1\" data-test=\"InlineImage-pictureContainer\"><picture data-test=\"Picture\"><source srcset=\"https:\/\/image.cnbcfm.com\/api\/v1\/image\/106480395-1586355120793gettyimages-132799406.jpeg?v=1586396391&amp;w=740&amp;h=416&amp;ffmt=webp&amp;vtcrop=y\" type=\"image\/webp\" media=\"(min-width: 1340px)\" \/><source srcset=\"https:\/\/image.cnbcfm.com\/api\/v1\/image\/106480395-1586355120793gettyimages-132799406.jpeg?v=1586396391&amp;w=630&amp;h=354&amp;ffmt=webp&amp;vtcrop=y\" type=\"image\/webp\" media=\"(min-width: 1020px)\" \/><source srcset=\"https:\/\/image.cnbcfm.com\/api\/v1\/image\/106480395-1586355120793gettyimages-132799406.jpeg?v=1586396391&amp;w=929&amp;h=523&amp;ffmt=webp&amp;vtcrop=y\" type=\"image\/webp\" media=\"(min-width: 760px)\" \/><source srcset=\"https:\/\/image.cnbcfm.com\/api\/v1\/image\/106480395-1586355120793gettyimages-132799406.jpeg?v=1586396391&amp;w=717&amp;h=403&amp;ffmt=webp&amp;vtcrop=y\" type=\"image\/webp\" media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" \/><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/image.cnbcfm.com\/api\/v1\/image\/106480395-1586355120793gettyimages-132799406.jpeg?v=1586396391&amp;w=929&amp;h=523&amp;vtcrop=y\" alt=\"The Danakil Depression is so other-worldly that scientists use it to study the possibility of life on other planets.\" width=\"619\" height=\"348\" \/><\/picture> <picture data-test=\"Picture\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.theatlantic.com\/thumbor\/0kcTh75JbJQYazLmonBvrOX5AgI=\/900x592\/media\/img\/photo\/2018\/04\/travel-monday-a-photo-trip-to-ethio\/d10_701733076\/original.jpg\" width=\"619\" height=\"407\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn.theatlantic.com\/thumbor\/0kcTh75JbJQYazLmonBvrOX5AgI=\/900x592\/media\/img\/photo\/2018\/04\/travel-monday-a-photo-trip-to-ethio\/d10_701733076\/original.jpg\" aria-labelledby=\"caption-104417\" \/><\/picture><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Nearby are a large area of limestone cliffs eroded into spires and cliffs.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"img\"><picture><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"lazyloaded alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.theatlantic.com\/thumbor\/jEukSEUxUcsXX79-gal-PnR5Ah0=\/900x593\/media\/img\/photo\/2018\/04\/travel-monday-a-photo-trip-to-ethio\/d06_498423169\/original.jpg\" width=\"583\" height=\"384\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn.theatlantic.com\/thumbor\/jEukSEUxUcsXX79-gal-PnR5Ah0=\/900x593\/media\/img\/photo\/2018\/04\/travel-monday-a-photo-trip-to-ethio\/d06_498423169\/original.jpg\" aria-labelledby=\"caption-104405\" \/><\/picture><\/figure>\n<p>Continuing back, we stopped at an open pool in the plain of clear water less than a foot below the surface.

They were at the edge of a huge area previously mined because there was a layer of dirt\/salt where large blocks could be lifted out. Guys using precision axe work cut it into uniform blocks then other guys dress the blocks by cutting off the dirt bottom and top and cutting the blocks into more precision rectangles. There must have been about 300 working in the area. The salt was carried away in large trucks taking in back all the way we had traversed yesterday. Now we know why they have remained in this inhospitable place.<br \/>\nAfter a long lunch at the Afar town where we slept, we started for <strong>Erta Ale volcano<\/strong> driving back through all the terrible roads through the volcano fields.

It was a 30-minute walk starting at 17:30 to the crater rim on a rough hiker-made trail. At the top are many rock buildings (that we were supposed to be sleeping in). Below is a huge crater with no visible activity. Drop down into the crater on a rough trail and walk across the crater to a caldera with two active sites. One is a large cone with great red fire. The other is off to the left and not as dramatic. It was pitch black at this time and we walked back in the night, impossible without a torch.

The remains found at the property, the oldest of which date back over 4 million years, provide evidence of human evolution, which has modified our conception of the history of humankind. The most spectacular discovery came in 1974 when 52 fragments of a skeleton enabled the famous Lucy to be reconstructed.<br \/>\nExcavations by an international team of paleontologists and pre-historians began in 1973 continued annually until 1976, and ended in 1980. During that time, they found many fossilized hominids and animal bones in a remarkable state of preservation, the most ancient of which were at least four million years old. In 1974, the valley produced the most complete set of remains of a hominid skeleton, Australopithecus afarensis, nicknamed \u2018Lucy\u2019, dating back 3.2 million years. Afarensis has since been proven to be the ancestral origin for both Genus Australopithecus and Homo sapiens.<br \/>\nA recovered female skeleton nicknamed \u2018Ardi\u2019 is 4.4 million years old, some 1.2 million years older than the skeleton of Australopithecus afarensis \u2018Lucy\u2019.<br \/>\nThere is a wealth of paleo-anthropological and pre-historic tools still awaiting discovery and scientific study and these are seen as constituting an exceptionally important cultural heritage resource.<br \/>\nThe site is called \u201cHadar\u201d and is situated south of the Danakil depression around 2-3 hours dirt road drive north of the Awash- Djibouti road near the new regional capital of Semera. It is \u201cnormal\u201d to visit it as part of a 4&#215;4 expedition into the Danakil or as a \u201cdiversion\u201d on the way back from Lalibela to Addis.<br \/>\nPermission is needed from the Afar Regional State Tourism Commission in Semera. Entrance is 50 birr per foreigner (c US$5) and a guide must be taken. This area is tribal and the sensibilities of the locals have to be assuaged by local involvement in the form of a guide at least.<br \/>\nWhat will you see? The site is surrounded by a fence marked by the UNESCO logo. Universities are still digging in the region. You see several \u201cdepressions\u201d where digs have previously taken place and the location where \u201cLucy\u201d was found is marked. And that seemed to be about it.<br \/>\nSeeing it requires a diversion that takes 2 extra days and an 800 km return. Just to see a few holes in the ground and a UNESCO sign?<br \/>\nThe remains of \u201cLucy\u201d are normally kept in a museum in Addis but are currently, and very controversially, on tour in the USA for several years. The tour would earn his country $25 million.<br \/>\nAnother early hominid site at Melka Kunture (near the WHS of Tiya) has a fine museum that covers both the specific site as well as placing all the Rift Valley hominid sites in context, including Lower Awash (Hadar) and Omo. Melka Kunture is not currently on Ethiopia&#8217;s Tentative List. It would seem so much better to link the Omo and Awash as well as Olduvai (and possibly other sites such as Turkana) into a single multi-national site &#8220;Early Hominid sites of the African Rift Valley&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>==============================================================<\/p>\n<p><strong>ETHIOPIA &#8211; AMHARA EAST (Lalibela, Dessie)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Flight <\/em>Ethiopian ADD-LLI @10:00 &#8211;\u00a0 $106<br \/>\n<em>I had only 30 minutes to make the transfer and the woman at security made me empty my entire pack (she never did say what she was looking for).

It is famous for its rock-cut monolithic churches. The whole of Lalibela is a large and important site for the antiquity, medieval, and post-medieval civilization of Ethiopia. To Christians, Lalibela is one of Ethiopia&#8217;s holiest cities and a center of pilgrimage. Ethiopia was one of the earliest nations to adopt Christianity in the first half of the 4th century, and its historical roots date to the time of the Apostles. The churches themselves date from the 7th to 13th centuries, and are traditionally dated to the reign of the Zagwe (Agaw) king Gebre Mesqel Lalibela (r. ca. 1181\u20131221).<br \/>\nThe layout and names of the major buildings in Lalibela are a symbolic representation of Jerusalem. This has led some experts to date the current church construction to the years following the capture of Jerusalem in 1187 by the Muslim leader\u00a0Saladin.<sup><br \/>\n<\/sup>Lalibela is roughly 2,500 metres (8,200\u00a0ft) above\u00a0sea level.\u00a0The\u00a0rock-hewn churches\u00a0were declared a\u00a0World Heritage Site in 1978.<br \/>\n<strong>History.<\/strong> During the reign of Gebre Mesqel Lalibela, a member of the Zagwe dynasty who ruled Ethiopia in the late 12th century and early 13th century. Lalibela, revered as a saint, is said to have visited Jerusalem and attempted to recreate a\u00a0new Jerusalem\u00a0as his capital in response to the\u00a0taking of old Jerusalem\u00a0by Muslims in 1187. Each church was carved from a single piece of rock to symbolize spirituality and humility. The Christian faith inspired many features receiving\u00a0Biblical names; even Lalibela&#8217;s river is known as the River Jordan. Lalibela remained the capital of Ethiopia from the late 12th into the 13th century.<br \/>\n<strong>Rock-Hewn Churches<\/strong> WHS. What is special about Lalibela, is that it is the site of eleven rock churches in four groups all within more or less a stone&#8217;s throw of each other.

There are no directional arrows or signs and only a few storyboards. Access the Eastern Group via the road above St Georges using tunnels and narrow corridors. The outsides are of the most interest as the windows of varying designs, have some intricate features and are surrounded by vertical walls. Some have wells to catch the water below the level of the churches. A few have some nice carved figures in niches and capitals but get very boring.

Its surface area ranges from 3,000 to 3,500 square km, depending on season and rainfall. The lake level has been regulated since the construction of the control weir\u00a0where the lake discharges into the Blue Nile. This controls the flow to the\u00a0Blue Nile Falls (Tis Abbai) and hydro-power station.<br \/>\nLake Tana was formed by volcanic activity, blocking the course of inflowing rivers in the early Pleistocene\u00a0epoch, about 5 million years ago.<br \/>\nLake Tana has many islands, whose number varies depending on the level of the lake.

One exception to this rule was Debre Berhan, founded by Zara Yaqob in 1456; Tegulet in Shewa was also essentially the capital during the first century of Solomonic rule. Gondar was founded by Emperor Fasilides around 1635 and grew as an agricultural and market town. The emperor also built a total of seven churches; the first two, Fit Mikael and Fit Abbo, were built to end local epidemics. The five emperors who followed him also built their palaces in the town.<br \/>\nBeginning with Emperor Menas in 1559, the rulers of Ethiopia began spending the rainy season near Lake Tana, often returning to the same location each year. In 1668, the inhabitants of Gondar were to be segregated by religion. This caused the Muslims and Jews to move into their quarters within two years. During the seventeenth century, the city&#8217;s population is estimated to have exceeded 60,000. Many of the buildings from this period survive.<br \/>\nThe town served as Ethiopia&#8217;s capital until Tewodros II moved the Imperial capital to Debra Tabor in 1856, and Gondar became a &#8220;city of Priests&#8221;; Tewodros II plundered and burnt the city in 1864, then devastated it again in December 1866. Abdallahi ibn Muhammad sacked Gondar when he invaded Ethiopia in June 1887 and was ravaged by Sudanese invaders who set fire to almost every one of the city&#8217;s churches. Lastly, it was bombed by the British trying to clear out Fascist Italians during WWII.<br \/>\nThe modern city of Gondar is a popular tourist destination for its many picturesque ruins in Fasil Ghebbi (the Royal Enclosure), from which the emperors once reigned. \u00a0Near the city lie Fasilides&#8217; Bath, home to an annual ceremony where it is blessed and then opened for bathing; the Qusquam complex, built by Empress Mentewab; the eighteenth-century Ras Mikael Sehul&#8217;s Palace and the Debre Berhan Selassie Church.<br \/>\nDowntown Gondar shows the influence of the Italian occupation of the late 1930s.<br \/>\n<strong>Transport.<\/strong> Air transport is served by Gondar Airport (GDQ Atse Tewodros Airport).

Walk 3-4 hours to Sankabar campsite (3250m ASL) with a good chance of seeing Gelada baboons.<br \/>\n<em>The walk followed on the edge of the escarpment with huge views to the west &#8211; endless small mountains and farming villages on the small flat areas. Because of the altitude, my weight, age, smoking and fitness, I was quite breathless for the few short climbs. We saw two troops of baboons, each with an imposing large male with a gold mane and about 10 females and juvenile males. They are very habituated and walk right in front of us.\u00a0\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>The road was within a few hundred metres of the trail and we walked on it three times, the last stretch for about a kilometre. Public buses were seen as well as some large trucks.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>I had one of those amazing meetups &#8211; a family with 4 kids living in Sudan that I had talked to while waiting to board in Khartoum drove by in a land cruiser, stopped and chatted.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>It started raining at about 3 am and the tent I was in had no fly with water leaking in the front door and both sides. I was awake when it started and put everything in my large pack and it stayed dry. Only the tour sleeping bag got wet. The tent was also too short and I had to lie diagonally.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\nDay 2 Sankabar to Geech. Walk 5-7 hours descending Jinbar Wenz (which feeds the waterfall) to Jinbar Waterfall a short ascent to Geech village and the campsite at 3600 ASL, just past Geech. Great views of the mountains with giant lobelia plants. See the sunset from the nearby Kedadit summit.<br \/>\n<em>After breakfast (pancakes and jam) at 7, we were off at 8. Today horses carried our luggage and I carried less than the first day. <\/em><br \/>\n<em>We followed next to the road and escarpment with views similar to the day before. We descended to a creek with a deep gorge below. Brook and Vitaly, who had been in Afar with me appeared at a lookout. They were in a Land Cruiser and had slept in Simien Lodge the night before. We climbed to the road and walked on it for over a kilometre. Public buses and big trucks passed us. For another remarkable occurrence, a family I had met in Khartoum airport passed, stopped and talked for a while. <\/em><br \/>\n<em>We eventually left the road and descended to the waterfall in a small rocky gorge, had lunch and rested in the sun for a while. It had little water in it and was not that impressive, falling about 15 feet onto a rock and pool. It was then a long climb up to camp for night two. We crossed two small drainages and eventually reached the broad plateau covered with bunchgrass. First, reach two abandoned metal shacks and five \u201chouses\u201d below where the park rangers stay. The camp was another round metal hut with benches inside and out and a fire in the middle where they cooked dinner. Our luggage and the set-up tents were waiting for us. <\/em><br \/>\n<em>We saw a nice fox fairly close to camp. Lobelia is a remarkable plant with a palm-like trunk, long leaves and a massive flower stalk. It blooms only once, then dies. There was also a pine tree similar to bristlecone pine. Much of the trunk is dead but a thin strip of active tree nourishes small bunches of needles. 3,800 m elevation.<\/em><br \/>\nDay 3 | Geech to Ambaras to Gondar. Trek to the Imet Gogo promontory, for one of the most spectacular views in the whole mountain range with a chance of seeing the magnificent Lammergeier vultures. Trek back to the road near Ambaras village and meet the car for the drive back to Gondar. Total walking time 4-5 hours.<br \/>\n<em>I had a flight to catch in Gondar at 5, so we calculated walking and driving time and were up for BF at 5:30 and walking at 6:30. We had phone service at the camp and were able to arrange for the vehicle to pick us up at 11:30 It was a gradual ascent to Imet Gogo where the broad plateau ends in a narrow rock promontory. Lobelia is common over the entire bunch grass plateau. After half an hour of photos and selfies, descend to the headwaters of the creek that feeds the waterfall fall below. Then it is a fairly flat walk through a forest of trees covered in lichen and hanging moss. Reach the bunch grass plateau again, but now is shorn short by all the cattle and horses that graze on this side of the stream. Three boys, in rags and one barefoot, ooggled us as we passed.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>We reached the road and the car at 11:35. The cooks had taken a shortcut with horses and were waiting with our luggage.<\/em><br \/>\n<em>It was then a relatively fast 3-hour drive back to Gondar. After dropping off my travel mates at their hotels, I got a tuk-tuk for the 12km drive to the airport.<br \/>\nON After arriving in Addis, I returned to Mad Vervet Hostel and stayed in a dorm room. They had water and I had a great hot shower, not possible in my first 4 days staying there.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Bati Monday Market.<\/strong> Attracting up to 10,000 Afar, Oromo and Amhara, and even some traders from Djibouti, this market is epic. It\u2019s Ethiopia\u2019s largest after Addis Ababa\u2019s Merkato, but it far eclipses the capital\u2019s interest and exotica. Within the market is an old gallows (dating from the emperor\u2019s day) and on the other side of town are the livestock and <em>chat<\/em> markets.
