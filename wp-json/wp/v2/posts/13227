Kaslo, on the shore of Kootenay Lake, was served by steamers connecting with railways near Creston and Nelson, British Columbia.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The railway was built west up Kaslo River to the pass with Seaton Creek, and passed across the hill above the boom town of Three Forks to Sandon. The Canadian Pacific Railway had already reached Three Forks in late 1894 by building from the west of Nakusp on the Arrow Lakes with its Nakusp and Slocan Railway. Both railways reached Sandon in late 1895.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Construction on the railway started in 1895 after obtaining financial backing from the Great Northern Railway, which was seeking advantages against the Canadian Pacific Railway and traffic for its mainline at Spokane. Great Northern had gained control of the Nelson and Fort Sheppard Railway in 1893, which gave it access to Kootenay Lake. Great Northern bought out the original investors in 1897, making the railway part of the Great Northern system under the Kootenay Railway and Navigation banner. Much of the ore from the K&amp;S was shipped to US smelters, providing traffic for the GN.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_873\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a class=\"size-full wp-image-873\" href=\"https:\/\/www.kaslonow.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/The-immortal-photograph-taken-by-RH-Trueman-of-the-KS-train-on-Payne-Bluff-near-Sandon..jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/www.kaslonow.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/The-immortal-photograph-taken-by-RH-Trueman-of-the-KS-train-on-Payne-Bluff-near-Sandon..jpg\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.kaslonow.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/The-immortal-photograph-taken-by-RH-Trueman-of-the-KS-train-on-Payne-Bluff-near-Sandon..jpg 870w, https:\/\/www.kaslonow.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/The-immortal-photograph-taken-by-RH-Trueman-of-the-KS-train-on-Payne-Bluff-near-Sandon.-223x300.jpg 223w, https:\/\/www.kaslonow.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/The-immortal-photograph-taken-by-RH-Trueman-of-the-KS-train-on-Payne-Bluff-near-Sandon.-768x1035.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.kaslonow.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/The-immortal-photograph-taken-by-RH-Trueman-of-the-KS-train-on-Payne-Bluff-near-Sandon.-764x1030.jpg 764w, https:\/\/www.kaslonow.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/The-immortal-photograph-taken-by-RH-Trueman-of-the-KS-train-on-Payne-Bluff-near-Sandon.-523x705.jpg 523w, https:\/\/www.kaslonow.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/The-immortal-photograph-taken-by-RH-Trueman-of-the-KS-train-on-Payne-Bluff-near-Sandon.-600x809.jpg 600w\" alt=\"\" width=\"870\" height=\"1173\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-873\" \/><\/a><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">The immortal photograph taken by RH Trueman of the K&amp;S train on Payne Bluff near Sandon\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span class=\"s1\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Anyone who\u2019s a Kootenay history buff has seen it: the classic photo of a locomotive poised a thousand feet above the valley floor at Payne Bluff, taken in 1897 by photographer Richard H. Trueman. The story of the building of the Kaslo &amp; Slocan Railway (K&amp;S) by the Great Northern Railway is one of both accomplishment and disaster. And it\u2019s a reminder that no matter how great our works, Nature remains the master.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Picture the scene: a gang of about 20 railroad labourers equipped with nothing but hand tools and dynamite, following the steep grade up Payne Mountain, near Sandon. With pickaxes, they chop out a path for the crew laying ties and tracks behind them. The narrow gauge track \u2013 a three-foot span instead of the four-foot, 8.5-inch span typical of the CPR \u2013 is well suited to the precarious terrain. The crew must build more than 30 trestle bridges between Kaslo and Sandon, a monumental task given the rudimentary tools. As a friend of mine said, \u201cPeople then had to be built of tougher stuff than we are today.\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span class=\"s1\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The K&amp;S line featured a total of 33.4 miles (53.7 km) of track, with a three-mile (4.8 km) spur from Sandon to Cody. It began service on November 20, 1895. \u201cFrom the terminus at Kaslo, the line gained altitude quickly using a switchback, then followed the Kaslo River past Fish and Bear lakes, climbing up the side of the mountain until it reached the site of Zincton. Old-timers claimed that if the stumps got too large, the K&amp;S line ran around them,\u201d wrote Hearne and Wilkie in <i>Canadian West<\/i> magazine. \u201cFrom there, the going was tough, and Payne Bluff, with its sheer drop of 1,080 feet, was rounded on a rocky ledge, with a \u2018grasshopper\u2019 trestle, just before reaching Sandon.\u201d It\u2019s fitting that Payne Mountain was the scene of this engineering triumph. It was there that Eli Carpenter and Jack Seaton staked the first silver-lead claim in the Slocan mining district on September 9, 1891.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The news sparked a massive influx of prospectors and mining capitalists hoping to get rich. By the following year, 750 more claims had been staked. Before the completion of the K&amp;S Railway in 1895, miners had only one way to get the ore down the mountains: by \u2018rawhiding.\u2019 Using bundles<\/span><\/span>\u00a0<span class=\"s1\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">made of animal hides, miners filled them with ore and then used horses to haul them down the steep trails to ore wagons. You can imagine how dangerous this would be, especially in wintertime.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">From there, wagons would haul them to steamboat landings at Kaslo or Rosebery. You can imagine the miners\u2019 exhaustion after hours and hours on bone-jarring wagon roads. This costly, labour-intensive method was later replaced by aerial tramways at the larger mines, sending ore carts on steel cables down the mountain in a fraction of the time. \u201cBecause the Slocan district held so many different varieties and grades of ores, smelting them was a difficult process,\u201d explains the Sandon Historical Society. \u201cAs a result, many of these ores had to be transported to smelters at Trail, or even further afield in Washington state.\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In 1896, its first full year, it made more than 500 round trips carrying 23,734 tons of freight and 28,307 passengers. Its principal function was to carry ore from the mines to the steamboats at Kaslo.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span class=\"s1\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Hoping to get in on the action, the Canadian Pacific Railway\u2019s Nakusp &amp; Slocan Railway was built from the Slocan Lakeside, reaching Sandon within weeks of the K&amp;S. Competition between the GNR and CPR was fierce. In 1895, when the CPR built a station there on land claimed by the K&amp;S, its employees wasted no time in retaliating. A heavy cable was slung around the CPR depot and attached to a K&amp;S locomotive, which then pulled it into Carpenter Creek. A newspaper report at the time stated that \u201cOldtimers still recall with glee when the little line, with a stout cable and a snatch block, snaked into smithereens the brand new depot building of the big company\u2026\u201d<\/span> <span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">While it lasted, the silver-lead boom in the Slocan kept both railways busy, serving as both freight and passenger lines. \u201cThe K&amp;S was justifiably proud that it was able to offer service between Spokane, Washington and Sandon in less than 12 hours, a fact that made delicacies such as oysters a possibility in remote and rugged Sandon,\u201d notes the Sandon Historical Society. Both railways competed with building spurs to service mines to obtain ore traffic destined for the other railway.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The K&amp;S was very profitable in the late 1890s. But as with all resource booms, the writing was on the wall for the end of an era. The CPR&#8217;s purchase of the Trail Smelter, combined with increased American tariffs on ore imports and crashing commodity prices, steadily whittled down the profit margin. The railway had high operating costs because of its location along the sides of steep hills, many of which had been burned in forest fires. Snow slides, avalanches and the annual spring washouts drove maintenance expenses sky-high. In 1900, Sandon burned to the ground, and labour problems at the mines spelled an end to the boom years, causing financial problems for the railway. By 1904, the line was losing money on each train it ran.<span class=\"s1\">\u00a0<\/span>In 1908, service was suspended to Sandon, with trains only servicing as far as McGuigan because expensive repairs needed to be done to bridges damaged by spring slides. While the track was rebuilt, service was never restored. In 1910, a severe forest fire burned many of the remaining major bridges and snow sheds. This finally bankrupted the K&amp;S Railway. The GNR abandoned the line, prompting calls for the revocation of their charter and its accompanying land grant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>The CPR.<\/strong> In 1911, GN sold the railway to Kaslo business people and local mine owners who revived the line enough to ship ore from the pass near Bear Lake down to Kaslo. With backing from the provincial government, in 1912, the CPR agreed to lease the K&amp;S for 999 years. The CPR rebuilt it to standard gauge and connected it with its existing Nakusp &amp; Slocan line by abandoning the exposed section across Payne Bluff and building a 6-mile extension from Zincton to Parapet, thereby establishing a line from Nakusp through to Kaslo in November 1913.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The region had a moderate boom during World War I with the increased need for minerals, but otherwise experienced a gradual decline in rail tracks. The CPR operated the line until it was abandoned. The final blow came in 1955 when torrential rains washed out a large section of track at Three Forks. Ore traffic had been dwindling for years, and the CPR decided not to rebuild. Its right-of-way was used to build a new road to New Denver.was severed in 1955 due to flooding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Route.<\/strong> The railway climbed steeply (3.35%) out of Kaslo to the first bench and then the pass at Bear Lake.

When it closed in WWI, he reworked the old Krao mine at Answorkth and the Silver Bell in McGuigan Basin.

The train came through several times a day.<br \/>\nUnfortunately, in the hot summer of 1910, a small blaze that started near New Denver was fanned by high winds and carried up Carpenter Creek Valley. My buildings in Rambler Basin and at McGuigan Camp went up in flames. At the Lucky Jim Mine, five lives were lost, and much of the Kaslo and Slocan Railway was destroyed. The approaching fire was seen in Whitewater in time to enable 36 people to take refuge in the mine tunnel. As the blaze roared past, the concentrator, mine buildings, houses and businesses became ashes. So hot was the inferno that the rails on the K&amp;S were twisted.<br \/>\nMost everything was rebuilt, and it was renamed Retallack.
