A wide range of plants was introduced for crops of timber, fruit, spices and oils. These are all abandoned now but the plants can still be found growing in the most unlikely places. In the 1940s a small grove of Coco-de-Mer trees was planted high in the mountains. This thriving population of this rare palm provided an occupation for part of the 1000 strong labour force on the island, some of whom had to climb up to the trees to water them daily. The dramatic legacy of the island&#8217;s history; a cast-iron neo-classical mausoleum, is the most remarkable piece of eccentricity in all Seychelles.<br \/>\nThe height of the mountains and the limited amount of development means that the island has an exceptional range of unique animals and plants. It is regarded by conservationists as one of the most important biodiversity hotspots in the Indian Ocean.<br \/>\nSilhouette Island is home to two National Monuments, the Plantation house and the Dauban Mausoleum. The plantation house reflects artistic and architectural movements originating from the Creole and European culture. It was built around 1861 as the family home for Mr. Henry Dauban, owner of the island at that time. The house has just gone through renovation.<br \/>\nCreole Seychellois culture.

By 1900, the tortoises were nearly extinct, and a crew would often have to hunt for three days to find one.<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-Carpin,_Sarah_1998_p.162_9-0\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>In the early 1800s, concessions given to individuals almost destroyed the forests and tortoise habitats in many islands in Seychelles; on Aldabra Atoll, in view of its remoteness and rugged topography, only small areas of forests were cleared for agricultural operations (mostly coconut plantations) but the tortoises were intensely captured for meat and trade.<span style=\"font-size: 10px;\">\u00a0<\/span>James Spurs, who had the concession of the atoll, was responsible initially for saving the tortoises when he banned killing them in 1891.<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMairBeckley201235_11-0\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>Following\u00a0World War II, exploitation of Aldabra for commercial use came to an end with only 200 visitors allowed at a time. Introduction of invasive species was banned, faunal species were protected under law, and active research on the ecology and biodiversity of the atoll was undertaken by the Royal Society of London from the middle of the 1970s.<br \/>\n<strong>Climate.<\/strong> Aldabra is situated in the dry zone of the south-west Indian Ocean. The northwest\u00a0monsoon\u00a0is from November to March and brings the heaviest rainfall. In the remaining months, the south-easterly trade winds are recorded. 960 millimetres (38\u00a0in) rainfall per year.\u00a0Cyclones\u00a0are rare in the Seychelles on account of its nearness to the\u00a0Equator.\u00a0Tides\u00a0in the coastal zone rise to 3 metres (9.8\u00a0ft) height, causing channel currents,\u00a0and a huge influx of water; the main channel drains 60% flow into the lagoon.<br \/>\n<strong>Fauna.<\/strong> There are 307 species of animals and plants on Aldabra.\u00a0Reptiles\u00a0are the prominent terrestrial fauna.\u00a0Sir David Attenborough\u00a0called Aldabra &#8220;One of the wonders of the world&#8221;, and it is also known as one of &#8220;crown jewels&#8221; of the Indian Ocean.<br \/>\nThe atoll has\u00a0the largest population of\u00a0giant tortoises\u00a0in the world (100,000 animals).\u00a0Tortoise size varies substantially across the atoll, but adult tortoises typically have a carapace length of about 105 centimetres (41\u00a0in) and can weigh up to 350 kilograms (770\u00a0lb). They are herbivores and feed on a variety of plants, trees and even algae that grows in the freshwater pools. The tortoises mate between February and May, the females then lay their eggs from June to September in areas with suitable soil layers. They lay eggs (the size of golf balls) in a clutch of three to five eggs every few years in high-density areas and 14-16 eggs in low-density areas. The females can lay several clutches in a year and\u00a0the incubation period is 73\u2013160 days. The small vulnerable juveniles have to survive the predation by coconut crabs, land crabs, rats and birds.\u00a0One of the longest-lived Aldabra giant tortoises was\u00a0Adwaita, a male who died at the age of about 250 years at\u00a0Kolkata&#8217;s\u00a0Alipore Zoological Gardens\u00a0on March 24, 2006.<br \/>\nAldabra is a breeding ground for the\u00a0hawksbill sea turtle\u00a0(<i>Eretmochelys imbricata<\/i>) and\u00a0green sea turtle. Aldabra has a large population of the world&#8217;s largest terrestrial\u00a0arthropod, the\u00a0coconut crab\u00a0and hosts the\u00a0white-throated rail, the only surviving flightless rail species in the Indian Ocean.<br \/>\nSharks,\u00a0manta rays,\u00a0barracuda\u00a0can be found in the seas surrounding the island.\u00a0Three extant species of lizards occur, There are three endemic species of bat from Aldabra. At least 13 species of\u00a0cetaceans, including\u00a0dolphins,\u00a0orcas, and especially\u00a0humpback whales,\u00a0have been known in the waters.\u00a0Dugongs, once thought to be regionally extinct in the 18th century,\u00a0have been confirmed for multiple times in very recent years.<br \/>\n<strong>Access.<\/strong> Aldabra is not easily accessed. No airstrips, helipads or landing jetties have been permitted to be built on the atoll. The nearest airfield on\u00a0Assumption\u00a0is 50 kilometres (31\u00a0mi) south-east of Picard Island. Supply ships operating from\u00a0Mah\u00e9\u00a0provide food and other essentials once every two months to the scientists and staff at the research station.<br \/>\nCruises are operated by several companies\u00a0along with dive boats which may visit the atoll on expedition tours. Visits by people other than the scientists and staff of the SIF are strictly controlled and only guided tours are provided with prior permission. Paved walking paths exist from the village of\u00a0La Gigi, which leads to a\u00a0promontory\u00a0from where scenic views of the large lagoon (during low tides) and the mangrove species are seen.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Islands<br \/>\n<\/em>Aldabra group<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Amirante group<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Alphonse Group\u00a0XL<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Southern Coral Group<\/strong>\u00a0(\u00cele Platte and Co\u00ebtivy Island)\u00a0XL<br \/>\n<strong>Farquhar group.\u00a0<\/strong>Belong to the\u00a0Outer Islands\u00a0lying in the southwest more than 700\u00a0km (430\u00a0mi) southwest of the capital,\u00a0Victoria, on\u00a0Mah\u00e9\u00a0Island.

Bird watching is also popular and the islands are home to many of the worlds most treasured and rare species of animals.
