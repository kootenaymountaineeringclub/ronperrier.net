The trail is well-marked by blue-diamond signs; it generally follows the coastline if you get sidetracked. Almost all of the backcountry campsites feature sunset views; bald eagles are particularly abundant along the trail. Warp and Gargantua Bays are especiallyworthy of exploration; set up camp here and enjoy day\u2019s worth of side trips, if you can spare the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>19.

Located near Thunder Bay, on Highway 587, ensure you\u2019ve packed plenty of water and your cardio is up to snuff before tackling this heavy-duty hike\u2014the reward is a panorama of Lake Superior from one of the highest points in Ontario. Featuring 300 metres of elevation gain,this hike starts at the South Kabeyun trailhead, which meanders alongside the lake until Tee Harbour; but don\u2019t be fooled by the relatively easy start. After this seven-kilometre jaunt, you\u2019ll hit the Talus Lake Trail, and the route will begin to slop decidedly upwards. The next section is a steep, zigzagging route, followed by a slightly less intense cool-down path to the lookout. Eat your picnic lunch next to the 200-metre cliffs and stand in awe of colossal, deep-blue Lake Superior. Return the way you came. Note: if you want to expedite your trek, mountain bike along the Kabeyun Trail, then hike from Tee Harbour onward.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <strong>Personal Opinion.<\/strong> This was one of the most boring hikes I have ever done. After a long boring hike through bush, the view from the &#8220;summit&#8221; was of virtually nothing &#8211; in a group of trees with no view. There was some views of the lake from the cliffs on the west side. But after hiking and climbing in the Rockies and interior of BC all of my life, this was not much. I guess if you have to live in Ontario, this is as good as it gets. I would log the top &#8211; make it one long ridge with great views. Trees tend to ruin hiking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>20.

Starting in the west, the linear route rambles through forested hills toward scenic lakes. You may have to cross a few streams; excellent wildlife-watching abounds. Soon, you\u2019ll be enjoying views of Georgian Bay as you hike over billion-year-old pink granite. In the eastern section, the trail ascends towards The Crack. The sparkling white quartzite cliffs are worth the effort; this area was once higher than the Rocky Mountains. There are 54 campsites along the route (permit required). Fall is the best time to tackle La Cloche, for the vivid foliage and nightly wolf-howls.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>21.

Experienced hikers should head to Les Lacs (17 kilometres one-way) or Les Cretes (16 or 18 kilometres, one-way) Trails. Les Lacs follows the Riviere Morris Valley, has a wilderness campsite about six kilometres along and passes Lac au Renard, Penouille and other scenic stillwaters before connecting to the 3,058-kilometre-long Appalachian Trail. As a more mountainous route, Les Cretes offers vistas of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Anse-au- Griffon Valley, has campsites at five and 10 kilometres along and connects to other trails (such as Les Graves) leading to the easternmost tip of the park, which stabs like a pointed finger into Gasp\u00e9 Bay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>22.

A challenging dayhike suitable for trekkers with strong cardio and a willingness to climb, the trailhead is located near Riviere a la Peche Campground and will take you on an uphill march for the next 8.5 kilometres. Expect some well maintained stairs and scramble-worthy rock sections and you\u2019ll have to ford a creek (which is at its lowest in fall)\u2014but the payoff is multiple lookout points (many with platforms or benches), including Ruisseau de Fou Falls. The campground at the trailhead offers secluded sites (some with electricity), kitchen shelters, drinking water, flush toilets and showers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>23.

The 10-kilometre route presents an intermediate-level challenge, and the 820-metre peak is adorned with an old fire tower.

At each, expect tent pads, fire pits, pit privy and cables to hoist your food clear of bears. So, when exploring the traditional home of the Mi\u2019kmaq, where does one start? For the quintessential Keji experience, tackle the 64-kilometre Liberty Lake Trail. There are 11 options for backcountry camping along the route; though three or four nights out is a good rule of thumb. Lakes, babbling brooks, loons and moose will be your companions as you loop your way through mixed softwoods en route to Campsite 42\u2014the most remote in the park\u2019s entire 404-square-kilometres.

On a clearing next to a serene ocean cove and pebble beach (once home to a Scottish fishing village), set up your tent for a pleasant overnight while you explore the beaches and inlets of the Cape Breton coastline. You\u2019ll need to pack in your own water, as well as a camp stove, as fires are not permitted. Pit toilets are available. There are effectively three options for tackling this trail: a six- or 12-kilometre trail, both returning the way they came, or an 18- kilometre route, but this linear route requires a vehicle shuttle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>27.

Green Gardens opens with the barren Tablelands before winding through boreal forest en route to the volcanically-shaped coastline Gros Morne is famous for. Sea stacks and jagged cliffs border the Gulf of St. Lawrence, as do fields of wildflowers with the occasional grazing sheep, shepherded by local farmers. There are three backcountry campsites on the coastline, with pit toilets and picnic tables. Fires are permitted on the beach.

A four-wheel-drive is not essential for reaching the trailhead, but it is a good idea\u2014it is located about 10 kilometres outside of the city, on Grey Mountain Road. The path starts on a steep, decommissioned road before opening up on the ridge-hike to the summit. If you want to keep going, a third peak about three kilometres past the summit offers views of downtown Whitehorse. The trail can be difficult to discern at times and remember, this is bear country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>30.

(By \u201cpopular,\u201d we mean perhaps 20 to 30 people in the area at one time, during peak summer season.) This trail carves a 15-kilometre loop into the Auriol Mountain Range\u2019s sub-alpine, with a optional two-kilometre offshoot that climbs into the alpine for an outstanding mountain view. With only 400 metres of elevation gain, it\u2019s an easy entry to Kluane\u2019s wilderness; expect to spend about five hours on the hike. One backcountry campsite is located on the trail. In the winter, it is also used as a cross-country ski and snowshoe trail.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>31.

The moderate-intensity summit-hike is about 15 kilometres long and requires a capable vehicle to access the trailhead. Keep an eye outfor caribou as you ramble through a moonscape to this stratovolcano\u2019s 2,205-metre summit; the environment is particularly remarkable in fall colours. In fact, this trail is best hiked in late-July through early September, after the bugs have died down and before the weather turns foul.

You\u2019ll start in boreal forest before reaching scrubby birch and willow trees and finally into the tundra. Over the next two days, veiwpoints from Glissade and Grizzly pass are your rewards for the often-challenging conditions. Watch out for grizzlies, and you may even spot migrating caribou. There are three campsites along the trail: Grizzly, Divide and Talus Lakes.

For starters, it\u2019s long. Like, really long. Also, it requires either a fly-in or fly-out, or both, if you sprain your ankle. It also usually requires food drops, extreme self-sufficiency and bear spray (grizzlies and black bears). The route follows an old industry road, unmaintained since 1945, so expect the occasional rusting hulk and oil barrel along the way. But mostly, it\u2019s all taiga, tundra, mountains and moose. And it\u2019s for experienced backpackers only. (Note: two explore magazine contributors rode this route on mountain bikes in a record-setting eight days, sans food drops; an award nominated story published in the Fall 2013 issue.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>34.
