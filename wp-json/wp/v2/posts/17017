When I visited her recently at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, she showed me a video of a baby in a high chair being fed something sweet by her mother. Almost as soon as the spoon is in the baby\u2019s mouth, her face lights up ecstatically, and her lips pucker as if to suck. Then Mennella showed me another video, of a different baby being given his first taste of broccoli, which, like many green vegetables, has a mildly bitter taste. The baby grimaces, gags, and shudders. He pounds the tray of his high chair. He makes the sign language gesture for \u201cstop.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/phenomena.nationalgeographic.com\/2014\/02\/03\/how-breast-milk-engineers-a-babys-gut-and-gut-microbes\/\">Human breast milk<\/a>\u00a0contains lactose, a sugar. \u201cWhat we know about babies is that they\u2019re born preferring sweet,\u201d Mennella said. \u201cIt\u2019s only been a couple of centuries since the time when, if you didn\u2019t breast-feed from your mother or a wet nurse, your chance of survival was close to zero.\u201d The aversion to bitter foods is inborn too, she said, and it also has survival value: It helps us avoid ingesting toxins that plants evolved to keep from being eaten\u2014including by us.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--below-paragraph InlineElement--content-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/4bd10756-3328-44bb-8236-216fb0c4c2d3\/MM8402_150513_00570.jpg?w=1272&amp;h=1272\" alt=\"tomatoes used for a blind taste test at the University of Florida\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">Can science create commercial tomatoes that taste the way tomatoes used to?

Anencephalic infants, who are born with virtually no brain beyond the brain stem\u2014the most primitive, ancient part\u2014react to sweetness with the same joyful-seeming facial expressions I saw in Mennella\u2019s video. The broccoli grimace is also primitive. In fact, although our tongues have just one or two types of receptor for sweet, they have at least two dozen different ones for bitter\u2014a sign of how important avoiding poison was to our ancestors.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--content-width InlineElement--desktop\" aria-label=\"Quote\">\n<blockquote class=\"Quote Quote--pull-quote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteBlock\">\n<div class=\"RichText Quote-text\">Food or poison?

The modern food environment is a tremendous source of pleasure, far richer than the one our ancestors evolved in, and the preferences we inherited from them\u2014along with a food industry that\u2019s increasingly adept at selling us what we like\u2014often lead us to adopt unhealthy habits. Yanina Pepino, a nutritional scientist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, told me that she once watched a child on an airplane add sugar to Coca-Cola\u2014an option that wasn\u2019t available to australopithecines.<\/p>\n<p>Our preoccupation with food has led to a boom in research on taste. It has turned out to be a very complicated sense\u2014more complicated than vision, said Robert Margolskee, director of the Monell Center. Scientists have made great progress in recent years in identifying taste receptors and the genes that code for them, but they are far from fully understanding the sensory machinery that produces our experience of food. Margolskee described it to me as \u201cone of these Rube Goldberg devices in which the little ball rolls down and activates this thing, which activates that thing, and there are about six different steps, and then a signal travels to your brain, and you either swallow what you\u2019ve got in your mouth or spit it out.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop ImageGroup__Wrapper\" aria-label=\"Image Pair\" data-bumper-index=\"3\">\n<div class=\"ImageGroup__Images\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure id=\"inline-4_0\" class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/e179674e-1516-4a2f-81cc-1bb464a82d9f\/MM8402_150513_02833.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=2560\" alt=\"food scientists at Noma in Copenhagen\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure id=\"inline-4_1\" class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/75481135-3994-45ee-bee4-37dabbe27d67\/MM8402_150513_02720.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=2560\" alt=\"grilled wild duck from Noma in Copenhagen\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">In the \u201cscience bunker\u201d at Noma, a celebrated restaurant in Copenhagen, head of research and development Lars Williams and full-time food scientist Arielle Johnson adjust a rotary evaporator\u2014a chemistry-lab machine they\u2019re using to extract a flavorful essence fro&#8230;<\/span><button class=\"Button--unstyled Truncate__Button\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-hidden=\"false\">Read More<\/button><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<p><b>Almost 25 years ago<\/b>\u00a0my wife introduced our daughter\u2019s Brownie troop to the \u201ctongue map,\u201d which she\u2019d learned about in a cookbook when she herself was a girl. Each of the basic tastes, she explained, is perceived by taste buds in a unique region on the tongue: sweet at the tip, salty and sour at the sides, bitter at the back. She gave the girls Q-tips and bowls of salt water, sugar water, and other liquids, and invited them to prove it to themselves.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI can taste everything everywhere,\u201d one of the girls said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t,\u201d my wife said. \u201cTry again, and really pay attention.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI can taste everything everywhere too,\u201d said another girl.<\/p>\n<p>As it happens, the Brownies were right, and their leader was wrong. It\u2019s true that in some people the receptors for particular tastes may be more concentrated in certain areas on the tongue, but all of them are found all over, and a Q-tip dipped in lemon juice will seem sour no matter where you dab it. (The receptors sit on the surface of taste cells, which are bundled together in taste buds.) The notion that each taste has its own tightly circumscribed detection zone can be traced, according to Linda Bartoshuk of the University of Florida, to a 1942 misunderstanding by a Harvard professor of a paper published in Germany in 1901. The tongue map wasn\u2019t definitively debunked until the 1970s, and many people still believe in it, even though it takes only seconds for seven-year-olds to disprove it.<\/p>\n<p>Aristotle counted seven basic tastes: the four known to my daughter\u2019s Brownie troop, along with astringent, pungent, and harsh. Nowadays most authorities agree on five: the Brownie four and umami, which was first described by a Japanese scientist a little over a century ago. It\u2019s the mouth-filling savory taste created or enhanced by things like soy sauce, aged beef, ripe or cooked tomatoes, and monosodium glutamate. More recently researchers have proposed at least half a dozen additional basic tastes. Fat and calcium are among the leading candidates\u2014both are believed to be detected by receptors on the tongue\u2014but there\u2019s no consensus yet.<\/p>\n<p>Taste receptors alone don\u2019t produce tastes; they have to be connected to taste centers in the brain. In recent decades scientists have discovered receptors identical to some of those on the tongue in other parts of the body, including the pancreas, intestines, lungs, and testes. We don\u2019t \u201ctaste\u201d anything with them, but if, for example, we inhale certain undesirable substances, the bitter receptors in our lungs send a signal to our brains, and we cough.<\/p>\n<p>As animal species have evolved, they\u2019ve sometimes lost tastes that their ancestors possessed. Cats and many other obligate carnivores, which eat only meat, can no longer detect sugars. (When cats lap milk, they\u2019re responding to something else\u2014probably fat.) Most whales and dolphins, which swallow prey whole, have lost almost all taste receptors.<\/p>\n<p>Something similar may have happened in humans. At Monell a scientist named Michael Tordoff handed me a plastic medicine cup containing a clear liquid and asked me to drink it. It tasted like water. He said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t taste much of anything, but this is something that rats and mice prefer to almost everything else we have ever, ever tested. If you give a rat a bottle of this and a bottle of sugar, it will drink more of this.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--content-width InlineElement--desktop\" aria-label=\"Quote\">\n<blockquote class=\"Quote Quote--pull-quote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteBlock\">\n<div class=\"RichText Quote-text\">The brain pays attention to whether you\u2019re sniffing or chewing and swallowing, and it doesn\u2019t treat those signals the same.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<p>The liquid contained maltodextrin, a kind of starch that\u2019s a common ingredient in sports drinks. If a human athlete takes a mouthful of maltodextrin solution and immediately spits it out, Tordoff said, the athlete will perform better, despite having tasted and ingested nothing or next to nothing. \u201cI don\u2019t have a good explanation,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere\u2019s something very special about starch that we don\u2019t understand. It may be there\u2019s a separate receptor for it or one specifically for maltodextrin. But the receptor is no longer plumbed into the conscious parts of the brain.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><b>Although the tongue map<\/b>\u00a0doesn\u2019t exist, there may be a taste map in the brain. A region called the gustatory cortex has been reported to contain clusters of neurons that are specialized to respond to individual basic tastes. Signals from the tongue reach them after passing through the brain stem, and in the gustatory cortex, or maybe along the way, they become part of a complex and only partially understood experience that we commonly call taste but should really call flavor. Linda Bartoshuk told me that only a small part of our experience of food comes from our taste buds. The rest is really the result of a kind of backward smelling.<\/p>\n<p>You can demonstrate this to yourself with candy.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/video.nationalgeographic.com\/video\/i-didnt-know-that\/idkt-food-tasters\">If you pinch your nose shut and chew<\/a>, say, an anonymous-looking white jelly bean, your tongue will register immediately that it\u2019s sweet. That sweetness comes from sugar, and it\u2019s the jelly bean\u2019s primary taste. Let go of your nose, though, and you\u2019ll immediately perceive the flavor: Ah, vanilla. Conversely, if you pinch your nose shut and put a drop of vanilla on your tongue, you won\u2019t taste anything, because vanilla has no taste\u2014only a flavor you can\u2019t detect with a pinched nose.<\/p>\n<p>When we chew, swallow, and exhale, Bartoshuk explained, \u201cvolatile molecules from the food are forced up behind our palate and into our nasal cavity from the back,\u201d like smoke going up a chimney. In the nasal cavity they bind with odor receptors\u2014and it\u2019s those receptors, of which humans have somewhere between 350 and 400 types, that are the main source of what we perceive as flavor. That\u2019s different from taste, which is the sensation derived from our taste buds, and it\u2019s also different from ordinary smelling, because the brain distinguishes between odors we sniff through our nostrils (orthonasal olfaction) and odors that reach our nasal cavity from behind as we eat (retronasal olfaction)\u2014even though the same receptors detect both.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--below-paragraph InlineElement--content-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/f2945560-0aa4-4892-a03a-06f803d68946\/MM8402_150513_00349.jpg?w=1272&amp;h=1272\" alt=\"a catfish being studied at Louisiana State University\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">Catfish are the supertasters of the animal world: Their skin, gills, lips, and whisker-like barbels are covered with taste buds much like those on the human tongue.

Odor information from retronasal olfaction goes to a different part of the brain\u2014the one that also receives information from the tongue. The brain combines retronasal olfaction and taste, creating what we call flavor, although the rules of integration are not well-known.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Jelly beans can be props for another trick too, Bartoshuk said. Releasing your nostrils when you\u2019re chewing one doesn\u2019t just tell you what the flavor is; it also makes the jelly bean taste sweeter\u2014an effect that\u2019s not caused by sugar, which contains no volatiles and therefore has no effect on smell receptors. The explanation, she said, is that other ingredients of a jelly bean contain volatile molecules that somehow \u201cenhance the sweet message,\u201d making the brain think the jelly bean contains more sugar than it does. Such sweetness enhancers are common in fruits, maybe because producing them costs less energy than producing sugar and yet they\u2019re just as effective at attracting insects and other pollinators and seed dispersers. \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/news.nationalgeographic.com\/news\/special-features\/2014\/05\/140514-go-east-young-men\/\">Strawberries<\/a>\u00a0have something like 30 volatiles that enhance sweet,\u201d Bartosuk said, \u201cand when you put all the signals together, you realize that a substantial amount of the sweetness is coming from their interaction in the brain.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That effect occurs even though the enhancers themselves aren\u2019t sweet.

Barb Stuckey, the chief innovation officer of Mattson, a food-and-beverage development firm in California, was once approached by a woman who\u2019d lost her sense of smell in a car accident. Her sense of taste\u2014the taste buds on her tongue and their connections to the brain\u2014seemed to be intact, but nothing tasted good anymore, because the connection between the odor receptors in her nose and her brain had been severed. She was missing most of the flavor of everything she ate. \u201cShe was in arbitration with the person who\u2019d hit her,\u201d Stuckey told me, \u201cand she needed to prove that she was disabled. That was a challenge, because she looked fine.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To help the woman demonstrate her impairment, Stuckey cut up a plain rice cake\u2014one of those Styrofoam-like disks of puffed white rice that are as close to tasteless and flavorless as food gets\u2014and seasoned the pieces with a mixture of standard reference compounds for all five basic tastes: sugar (sweet), table salt (salty), citric acid (sour), pure caffeine (bitter), and monosodium glutamate (umami). All those compounds are essentially volatile free and therefore have no effect on odor receptors. \u201cI sent the rice-cake pieces to the woman and told her to give them to the arbitrators and explain that this is what everything tastes like to a person who has no sense of smell,\u201d Stuckey said.<\/p>\n<p>She offered me the same experience, and I put a piece of rice cake in my mouth and chewed. The seasoning created a mildly complicated and slightly chemical sensation on my tongue, as I experienced the five basic tastes all at once. But because there were almost no volatiles, I perceived very little flavor, and nothing that made me want to reach for a second piece. \u201cThat\u2019s what every meal is like for her now\u2014pizza, lobster, whatever,\u201d Stuckey said. \u201cCan you imagine?\u201d The woman won her case.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--content-width InlineElement--desktop\" aria-label=\"Quote\">\n<blockquote class=\"Quote Quote--pull-quote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteBlock\">\n<div class=\"RichText Quote-text\">Most culinary schools don\u2019t teach students how to taste before they start to cook &#8230; But how can you possibly start an education around food without the building blocks of flavor?<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<p>Remarkably, people who\u2019ve lost just their sense of taste take even less pleasure in eating, even though taste buds make a relatively small contribution to flavor. The main reason seems to be that if the taste receptors on the tongue aren\u2019t functioning, the brain mostly ignores input from retronasal olfaction. Stuckey thinks the basic tastes also create a flavor\u2019s \u201cstructure.\u201d \u201cI think of these as the girders, the steel beams,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are foods out there that, without the bitterness that occurs in them naturally, would taste really flabby and flat and one-dimensional. Tomatoes, for example.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In addition to her duties at Mattson, Stuckey teaches a course at the San Francisco Cooking School called \u201cThe Fundamentals of Taste.\u201d \u201cMost culinary schools don\u2019t teach students how to taste before they start to cook,\u201d she said. \u201cThey jump right in with, like, knife skills. But how can you possibly start an education around food without the building blocks of flavor?\u201d She and her students do an exercise in which they make barbecue sauce. Most of the ingredients she provides are ones you would guess: tomato sauce, tomato paste, sugar, honey, liquid smoke, paprika. But there\u2019s also a tray of ingredients whose predominant taste is bitter: coffee, cocoa, tea, bitters. \u201cIt\u2019s not really intuitive, because you don\u2019t think of barbecue sauce as bitter, but if you taste it before and after you add a bitter ingredient, you realize that bitter changes the whole gestalt. It adds a complexifying note.\u201d At home Stuckey uses soluble espresso\u2014instant coffee\u2014as a bitter complexifier for many dishes, and especially for sweet or sweetish sauces.<\/p>\n<p>Mattson\u2019s research laboratories contain a lot of high-tech testing equipment, but in one of them I met three researchers who were chewing thoughtfully and staring into plastic cups. A food manufacturer had hired Mattson to replicate a spicy brown-rice dish sold by one of its competitors, and chemical analysis could take the folks in white lab coats only so far. \u201cThe human palate is the most sophisticated analytical device there is,\u201d Stuckey said. \u201cYou have to put it in your mouth.\u201d<\/p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop InlineVideo\" aria-label=\"Video\" data-bumper-index=\"12\">\n<div class=\"SingleVideo\">\n<div data-meta-id=\"inline-10\">\n<div class=\"NatGeoVideoPlayer NatGeoVideoPlayer--videoPlaying aspect-ratio--parent aspect-ratio--16x9 VideoPlayer\">\n<div class=\"VideoPlayer--placeholder absolute-fill\">\n<div class=\"MediaPlaceholder relative MediaPlaceholder--16x9 cursor-pointer height-contain\" tabindex=\"-1\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent MediaPlaceholder__Image\">\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper aspect-ratio--child\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/07dddac0-7885-4814-bfb9-9d418f85751f\/00000150-d89a-dd38-ab58-ff9f041a0001.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=1440\" alt=\"\" aria-hidden=\"true\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<div class=\"MediaPlaceholder__Overlay absolute-fill flex flex-center-all\">\n<div class=\"MediaPlaceholder__Pill  items-center absolute flex\" aria-hidden=\"true\">1:33<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"LoadAnimation LoadAnimation--darkBG LoadAnimation--md\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">Learn how the sight, smell, and sound of food influence its flavor.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>In the late 1980s\u00a0Linda Bartoshuk, who was on the faculty at Yale at the time,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/theplate.nationalgeographic.com\/2014\/09\/30\/are-you-a-supertaster\/\">identified what she called supertasters<\/a>\u2014people whose taste buds are so numerous and so densely packed that they experience the basic tastes with uncommon intensity. That\u2019s not all good: Supertasters get more pleasure from the foods they like than ordinary tasters do, but they also dislike more foods, especially strong-flavored ones. At Monell I got a vivid demonstration of how different a supertaster\u2019s experience can be. After Michael Tordoff gave me a sip of maltodextrin, a geneticist named Danielle Reed (who\u2019s married to Tordoff) had me drink a second clear liquid in a plastic medicine cup. Again I tasted nothing.<\/p>\n<p>Hakan Ozdener, a colleague of Reed\u2019s, happened to walk past her door. She called to him and handed him a cup of the same solution. Almost the moment it touched his lips, he winced, then looked as if he\u2019d taken a swig of gasoline.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s PTC,\u201d Reed said. \u201cPhenylthiocarbamide. Seventy percent of Caucasians are taste blind to it, but for people who can taste it, it\u2019s extremely bitter.\u201d And for some it\u2019s intolerably so\u2014Bartoshuk discovered supertasters while working on PTC. The concentration in Reed\u2019s solution was very low, almost homeopathic, but Ozdener was still gasping. (\u201cPeople are afraid to walk past my office,\u201d Reed said.) As a bitter supertaster, Ozdener is less likely than I am to like Starbucks coffee or rapini. On the other hand, Tordoff told me later, he\u2019s probably less susceptible to some upper-respiratory tract infections\u2014the PTC-detecting receptor is also in the nose, where it seems to detect certain bacteria and prompt us to expel them.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--below-paragraph InlineElement--content-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/c103708d-6eb1-45df-8e40-aedc5d639b8c\/MM8402_150513_00974.jpg?w=1272&amp;h=1272\" alt=\"a dessert at Fat Duck restaurant in Bray, England\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">One dessert at the Fat Duck restaurant in Bray, England, is caviar sorbet with truffle toast and a box of oak moss.

The food industry has been attacked for loading products with ingredients we\u2019ve evolved to crave, but when it tries to make healthier products, we don\u2019t always reward it.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<p>In 2002, when McDonald\u2019s announced that it would stop frying foods in oils containing trans fats, it received complaints that its french fries didn\u2019t taste as good\u2014and maybe they didn\u2019t, but some of the complaints came from cities where the change hadn\u2019t been made yet. Cutting salt from manufactured foods is even trickier. There\u2019s general agreement that most of us eat too much. Yet if you give consumers two bowls of soup that are identical except for their salt content, they\u2019ll usually prefer the saltier one, and if you describe a soup to them as low in salt, they\u2019ll generally rate it less favorably than the \u201cregular\u201d version, even if the two are identical. Food companies complain that if they do cut salt, they\u2019re almost forced to do so without taking credit\u2014they can\u2019t promote the low-salt version the way beverage manufacturers have promoted sugar-free sodas.<\/p>\n<p>And even that business is fraught. In recent years sugar has replaced fat and salt as the most vilified element of the modern diet, but replacements for it are controversial too. This year PepsiCo removed the nonnutritive sweetener aspartame from Diet Pepsi, not because scientific studies had shown it to be harmful, but because aspartame has a lousy reputation among health-conscious consumers. The new aspartame-free Diet Pepsi contains two other sweeteners, sucralose and acesulfame potassium. There\u2019s no guarantee they\u2019re safer.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop ImageGroup__Wrapper\" aria-label=\"Image Pair\" data-bumper-index=\"15\">\n<div class=\"ImageGroup__Images\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure id=\"inline-12_0\" class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/7b517099-a2e4-4816-b6b8-e1cb67e3e449\/MM8402_150513_02272.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=2560\" alt=\"ants at Nordic Food Lab in Copenhagen\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure id=\"inline-12_1\" class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/b7d81966-b4be-41f3-b983-d62aeb490393\/MM8402_150513_02433.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=2560\" alt=\"mackerel entrails at Nordic Food Lab in Copenhagen\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">Our responses to basic tastes are inborn, but our perceptions of smells\u2014the main constituents of flavor\u2014are learned.

A child\u2019s response to sweetness can be so gratifying to parents that they end up reinforcing it: How many other mood-altering tricks work so quickly and so well?<\/p>\n<p>But there are public health implications, and they go beyond increases in childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes. Mennella worries in particular about \u201cbaby-bottle caries\u201d\u2014tooth decay caused by sugar-containing beverages, including fruit juice\u2014especially in children who are put to bed with bottles. It\u2019s \u201ca major preventable disease of childhood,\u201d she said, \u201cand it\u2019s reaching epidemic proportions.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Bartoshuk told me that increasing the concentration of sweetness-enhancing volatiles in certain foods may make it possible to reduce their sugar content without making them taste less sweet. But she worries about unintended consequences. \u201cAs soon as we can produce a sweet experience that has no calories, isn\u2019t toxic, and has no nasty characteristics\u2014what will that mean for the brain?\u201d she said. \u201cWe know that sweetness uses neural pathways that look very much like the ones used by drugs of addiction, which are believed to hijack circuitry that evolved for food and particularly for sweet. So are we doing anything terrible?

A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found a large, sudden increase in the popularity among teenagers of electronic cigarettes, in which a battery-powered heating element turns a nicotine-bearing solution into vapor, which is then inhaled. \u201cVaping\u201d has helped many longtime smokers cut back on real cigarettes, but it also circumvents a strong inhibition to taking up smoking in the first place: the repellent taste and smell. In teenagers it may do that in part by exploiting their vulnerability to sweetness\u2014some popular vaping liquids contain sucralose, and young users often add it on their own.<\/p>\n<p>The good news is that our inborn taste inclinations are not immutable. People who succeed in reducing salt in their diet typically find that their tolerance for highly salted food declines. And our natural resistance to broccoli, brussels sprouts, and other healthful but bitter foods can be overcome through experience\u2014especially if it begins early. Mennella\u2019s research has shown that babies\u2019 flavor preferences are affected by their mothers\u2019 diet during pregnancy and by their own diet after birth. \u201cBabies can learn to like a variety of foods,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they have to taste the food in order to like it.\u201d Her main advice to parents is to set good examples and not give up. When the baby in her broccoli video is offered a second spoonful, he still shudders\u2014but he opens his mouth.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--below-paragraph InlineElement--content-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"Image InlineImage--image\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/07732605-a1e8-4d03-8f73-81f4f4d7a7a8\/MM8402_150513_01359.jpg?w=1272&amp;h=1272\" alt=\"feast participants dressed as their spirit animals in Tasmania\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--content-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/f49fe388-7c50-40bc-832c-ea3f979e7975\/MM8402_150513_01234.jpg?w=1272&amp;h=1272\" alt=\"participant enjoying food at a feast in Tasmania\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">At a recent feast in Tasmania concocted by Bompas &amp; Parr, a London firm specializing in \u201cimmersive flavour-based experiences,\u201d participants dressed as their spirit animals and sniffed their neighbors while drinking cocktails that resembled animal blood.
