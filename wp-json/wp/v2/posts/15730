Its formal ownership has changed hands from the Egyptians, Ottomans, British and Sudanese. After half a century of ethno-religious conflict and a long war in which over 1 million people were killed, South Sudan legally seceded from Sudan on 9 July 2011. Relations between the two Sudans remain tense. Sudan depends on hard currency obtained from transshipping oil from South Sudan through Port Sudan on the Red Sea, while landlocked South Sudan depends on access to that port, and the two countries have argued about terms for transshipment. There has also been some armed conflict over the oil-rich Abyei District which is ruled by Sudan but borders on South Sudan, and the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army-North, which fought alongside the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army that now rules South Sudan.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Beautiful country outside of Juba but one of the most corrupt and chaotic in Africa.

All the base was finished as a very wide (~35m) hard-packed and graded surface. We passed the common cattle cattle, Mundari camp that virtually every tourist coining to S Sudan sees.

Most were covered in the grey dirt that they spread on themselves for fly protection. The people are very tall and slim, no obesity here, very proud and curious about us but not intrusive in any way. They loved photos being taken and none shied away from a camera.<br \/>\nDinner was white rice with the toughest beef heavy with bones (vertebrae?).<br \/>\nI went to bed at 10 but there was so much noise from kids playing that I got up and had. a lot of fun watching them play, sing, dance, jump in the air, run around and laugh. A common &#8220;game&#8221; was to place 10 or so little kids in a circle with their legs facing in, two would touch one little kid&#8217;s head and run around the circle with the first to touch his head again the winner.

The night before there were only 5 small reed huts but they had set up tents and small cloth rectangles held up with branches with room only for one person. Everyone wanted to pose with their prize bull often adorned with cloths and tassels. Little kids were collecting dung and rolling it into balls and placing them in piles. Small clumps of grass were put on top and lit to make smudge pots.

The extent of the Sudd wetlands is highly variable; it depends largely on the seasons and years respectively. In the wet season, the size of the wetland increases up to 90,000 km\u00b2 and gradually decreases to about 42,000 km\u00b2 depending on high seasonal floods. It is sustained by the flow of the White Nile (or Bahr el Jebel) from Lake Victoria in Uganda, in addition to rainfall runoff from its surrounding areas. The White Nile dissipates northwards from Juba across a shallow depression to produce a network of channels, lagoons and inundated areas, which harness the nutrients of the underlying clay soils. Patterns of flood inundation heavily influence the Sudd\u2019s vegetation, which consists primarily of permanent swamps, river and rain-flooded grasslands, and floodplain woodlands. These habitats exhibit strong environmental gradients with pronounced short and long-term variations in biomass production and distribution.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Sudd wetland falls within the \u201cSudd-Sahelian Flooded Grasslands and Savannas\u201d WWF Global 200 eco-region. The Sudd is Africa\u2019s largest wetland and one of the largest tropical wetlands in the world. It is a vast social-ecological and hydrological system driven by the dynamics Nile basin\u2019s water regime, supporting a diverse array of wildlife and various cultural traditions of its indigenous communities.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It is internationally recognized for its unique ecological attributes that include various endangered mammalian species, antelope migrations, millions of Palaearctic migratory birds and large fish populations. Notable wildlife species include the African elephants, Nile lechwe &#8211; endemic to South Sudan, tiang migration, white-eared kob migration<em>,<\/em> buffalo, and bird species including the shoebill.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Sudd is an important wintering ground for some of the migratory birds such as the Great White Pelican, Black Crowned Crane, White Stork, and Black Tern. It forms part of the East-Asian\/East African flyway of Palearctic birds, linking breeding ranges in central-Europe and Asia with winter ranges to the south. A large number of inter-African bird migrants also rely on the Sudd and surrounding habitats as a dry-season refuge.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Sudd has rich and abundant fish populations, a response to the favourable environmental conditions for recruitment and survival offered by its mosaic of habitat types. Key aquatic habitats range from open water and riverine to lacustrine and palustrine, which offer ideal spawning, rearing, growing, feeding and survival grounds for over a hundred species of fish.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The culture and society of the approximately 1 million people inhabiting the Sudd wetland region are closely linked to its ecological functioning. The dominant cultural affiliations in the Sudd are the tribes of Nuer (Southern Liech State), Dinka (Eastern Lakes state), Shilluk (Upper Nile State) and Anyuak (Akobo State) all of which are Nilotic and pastoralist peoples indigenous to the Nile Valley. These groups have developed traditions that have allowed them to adapt to the inundated and seasonally variable conditions across the Sudd through a combination of nomadic agro-pastoralism, non-timber forest product collection and fishing. Specific practices include the seasonal construction of settlements on small islands in flooded areas and traditional hunting and fishing techniques. The hydrological functions and patterns of the Sudd maintain the livelihoods and cultural practices of the Sudd\u2019s tribes. \u00a0The cultural groups living within the Sudd region also maintain beliefs and practices that serve to support and conserve the environment they live in. For example, the cultural beliefs of the Shilluk community living within the Sudd region are an important aspect in the preservation of the Nile lechwe (antelope species endemic to South Sudan) as they consider killing of the animal species as taboo, and this of course helps in their conservation and sustainable use. It is therefore valuable to support many of the cultural practices of the communities living in the Sudd as these are closely intertwined with the natural elements and preserving them also creates and maintains an awareness of past and traditional knowledge in the general public.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>On the boat, we cruised south on a wide channel and saw a few birds &#8211; two fishing eagles, a heron and a kingfisher.

Most of the men are gone and fighting in the north. Most of these kids will never go to school and are destined to be fishermen like their fathers.

The area includes Boma National Park and Badingilo National Park.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Boma-Badingilo Migratory Landscape ranges from the White Nile in the west to the border with Ethiopia in the east. However, the migratory herds of white-eared kobs leave the area for a while during their migration to cross the Ethiopian border into the area of \u200b\u200bthe local Gambela National Park.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Flora. The flora is dominated by grasslands and tree savannas, there are floodplains along rivers. Common grass genera include\u00a0<i>Hyparrhenia\u00a0,\u00a0Sporobolus\u00a0,\u00a0Pennisetum<\/i>\u00a0, and\u00a0<i>Echinochloa<\/i>\u00a0.\u00a0Acacia\u00a0and\u00a0long threads\u00a0are common on trees\u00a0.\u00a0Fires that occur during the\u00a0dry season\u00a0prevent grasslands from becoming bushy and are therefore essential for the ecosystem.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Fauna. The most common animals of the region are the white-eared kob, the tiang and the Mongalla gazelle, which can form herds of thousands of animals in search of water and fresh greenery. The trek begins with the onset of the dry season in the savannahs of Badingilo National Park. The herds of the Tiang are now moving north to the swamps and flood plains of the Sudd, while the White-eared Kob migrate from Badingilo National Park to Boma National Park, crossing the Ethiopian border into the territory of the latter to get to Gambela National Parks. During the rainy season, both species migrate back to the savannas of Badingilo National Park.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The animal population is estimated at around 800,000 white-eared kobs, 160,000 tiang and 250,000 Mongalla gazelles.\u00a0In addition to the migratory species, there are also a large number of herbivores that are loyal to the site and undertake no or less pronounced migrations.\u00a0These include\u00a0gemsbok,\u00a0Lewel&#8217;s hartebeest,\u00a0eland,\u00a0reedbuck,\u00a0cape buffalo,\u00a0elephants,\u00a0hippos\u00a0and\u00a0giraffes.\u00a0It is not yet known whether the Mongalla gazelle is migratory or sedentary.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Predators are represented by\u00a0lion,\u00a0leopard,\u00a0cheetah, and\u00a0wild dog.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">However, the populations of many animal species have drastically decreased due to hunting.\u00a0While 29,460\u00a0zebras\u00a0were counted in Boma National Park during the dry season in 1980, this species is now believed to be extinct with the last confirmed sighting in 2009 and an unconfirmed sighting in 2013.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">=============================================================<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>GENERAL<br \/>\nSAFETY.<\/strong> The civil war lasted in Juba from 2013 to March 2020, and although there have been no clashes between the warring factions in Juba since, there is a lot of tension. The number of ex-pats, the prevalence of weapons and the willingness to use violence cause a high risk to visitors. There are frequent armed robberies, car-jackings, and armed break-ins affecting foreign nationals. The South Sudanese security forces are often tense, some are very young and\/or under the influence of alcohol.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The UN maintains a curfew and all travel during darkness should be avoided. Some areas of the city are distinctly unsafe, e.g. Rock City. Traffic is chaotic and boda-bodas are often involved in accidents. Stay away from official convoys. The South Sudanese military (SPLA) drives not only aggressively but offensively. They believe they have the right of way, drive extremely fast, and do not care about any traffic regulations.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Outside of Juba, South Sudan remains dangerous for travel as ceasefire violations and boundary disputes have continued. Travelling near the Sudan or Central African Republic borders is extremely dangerous. Violent crime remains problematic; unexploded ordnance from years of civil war also poses hazards to civilians.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Western governments continue to advise citizens to avoid all travel (or leave South Sudan if already in the country) due to ongoing armed conflicts, inter-ethnic violence, and widespread violent crime. As of April 29th, 2020, South Sudanese leaders have negotiated a peace deal, which was agreed on. However, all travellers visiting South Sudan should still be extremely cautious as kidnappings, shootings, and carjackings can happen at any time, including in Juba. In addition, the peace deal can be broken at any time by the involved warring factions and fighting could resume at any moment.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Health<br \/>\n<\/strong>Prepare for malarial, yellow fever, polio, and hepatitis A and B. Be sure to sleep under a\u00a0mosquito net\u00a0and use mosquito repellent. Most of the South Sudanese drink\u00a0water\u00a0from the rivers, which exposes them to diarrhea and cholera. If bottled water is not available, boil\/chlorinate the river water before drinking it.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><br \/>\nHISTORY. <\/strong>\u00a0The Europeans (especially the British) came to Africa at the same time as Islam. The British made South Sudan a closed district as early as the 1930s and a special permit to enter South Sudan was needed and Muslims couldn\u2019t enter. Greeks were here even earlier. Only a few missionaries were allowed and only Juba saw foreigners.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">This means that South Sudan is not impacted by modern culture, schooling etc. 80% of the people are involved in cattle herding. People are still naked and don\u2019t care who is looking at them. The culture is unique and you can still find more authenticity in S Sudan than probably anywhere else. Can see a camp where they use cow urine to dye their hair. I don\u2019t think there is another country that is so unique, with very different tribes.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Masaai in Kenya \u2013 for tourists, it is all acting \u2013 the people are very clean, after the \u2018show\u2019 they put on their trousers, etc.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>NATIONAL PARKS<\/strong>. Seven but need to be developed properly. Can see all the so-called \u2018Big 5\u2019 though the most common are different types of antelopes. Only Nimule National Park, near the border with Uganda, is operational in a formal way.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Things are quite basic. There is usually no hotel, and use tents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>TOURS.<\/strong> Government tariff\/travel permit\u00a0of $150 per day,\u00a0Permits cost $150 a day, but there is no development or good game parks. The tour companies are the ones promoting the tribes.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Donations to the Chief of the cattle camp. As of November 2019, tourists were being asked to pay $100-150 per person as a compulsory donation to the chief. Previously visitors brought medicines for the cattle, rice, medical supplies, and other similar items. It varies with the camp and will determine which camps are visited. It is anticipated the price will rise until visitors stop coming.

Although predominantly Dinka, it also has people from different tribes \u2013 Toposa and Mundari. The camp does not portray the pure culture seen with the tribes due to its proximity with the city and is just a glance at tribal culture. It is however the closest thing related to tribal cultures one can see in the city.

At the market, I met his uncle Sallah Modi, a tailor, who quickly sewed a Mundari outfit for me, a gift. While in Terekeka, we spent a couple of hours at the admin offices to obtain a special visitors permit for Terekeka county. I met the mayor, a few government officials, and officers of the S Sudan Police, National Security, and the SPLA (Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army) who greeted me with such warmth. After getting the permit, we drove about 30 miles further north to Tukoro village where we attended a Mundari church event and bush camped with a Mundari clan.
