It was March 2022, and these patients were vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19, and they also had recently recovered from an infection. In their minds, the combined immunity would shield them from further harm.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI started thinking, is this really true?\u201d says Al-Aly,\u00a0chief of research and development at the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Healthcare System\u00a0and a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis. Intrigued, he turned to the VA\u2019s medical records database to find out.<\/p>\n<p>Time has since made clear that there are cracks in the shield created by both natural and vaccine-induced immunity: Reinfection rates\u00a0are rising\u00a0with the emergence of the more infectious Omicron variant, with some people even reporting their third or fourth infection. Studies\u00a0have\u00a0also\u00a0shown\u00a0that the Omicron subvariants are more capable of evading previous immunity. (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/magazine\/article\/why-omicron-variants-ba4-and-ba5-are-causing-fresh-us-outbreaks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i>Why Omicron variants BA.4 and BA.5 are causing fresh U.S. outbreaks<\/i><\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>But while this epidemiological data shows that COVID-19 reinfections are possible, do they pose any real risk to patients like those Al-Aly treats in his clinic?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe answer is clearly yes,\u201d he says. In June, Al-Aly\u00a0published a study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, analyzing more than 5.6 million military veterans\u2019 medical records that showed each new infection added to their risk of dying from just about any cause. It also boosted the odds of other troubling health outcomes from heart, blood, and brain disorders, as well as diseases such as diabetes, chronic fatigue, and long COVID.<\/p>\n<p>But he and other experts caution that many questions remain. We still don\u2019t understand why reinfections were associated with increased risk of these health outcomes among veterans\u2014a population that doesn\u2019t reflect the broader public because it skews older, white, and male. It\u2019s also unclear whether newer COVID-19 variants are more likely to cause severe disease or how long it takes immunity to wane and leave you vulnerable to reinfection.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you add all that up, those are a lot of unknowns, and that\u2019s what makes it so complicated,\u201d says\u00a0Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. \u201cI call it an infectious disease calculus problem.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what scientists do know so far, and how they\u2019re attempting to solve this complex equation.<\/p>\n<h2>The spectrum of harm from reinfections<\/h2>\n<p>Reinfection risks vary by disease. For some, such as measles, yellow fever, and rubella, there\u2019s not much reason to worry about a second infection because one bout of the disease or vaccination provides long-lasting immunity. This usually prevents you from getting reinfected in the first place or leads to such a mild infection that it\u2019s unlikely you would notice it.<\/p>\n<p>Then there are diseases where immunity wanes over time, leaving a person more susceptible to reinfections. The severity of that reinfection hinges on many factors, including underlying conditions, changes to the person\u2019s health that might have strained their immune system, the timing of vaccination, and changes to the virus itself.<br \/>\nTake the flu, for example. The flu virus mutates so frequently that it confounds the immune system\u2014each new infection is just like getting hit with the flu for the first time. \u201cSo your body can\u2019t say, \u2018Oh I\u2019ve seen you before, I know how to deal with you.<br \/>\nAs a rule, however, reinfections are typically milder than a first infection. It makes perfect sense: The immune system has been primed. We may have symptoms, but the response is so fast that eventually it controls the replication.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Dengue fever is one exception. It causes a rare phenomenon in which the immunity from a previous infection can work against you by creating antibodies that inadvertently help the virus invade host cells. There\u2019s no evidence this is the case with SARS-CoV-2\u2014and if that were the case, hospitalizations would likely be skyrocketing right now. But scientists say it has been important to rule that out as one of the paths the virus could take.<\/p>\n<h2>What the evidence says about COVID-19 reinfections<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s clear now that both natural and vaccine-derived immunity against COVID-19 do wane over time. But the severity of those reinfections has been hotly debated.<\/p>\n<p>When Al-Aly\u2019s report came out in June, there was a dust-up on social media about the study, which seemed to suggest that reinfections are more severe than a primary infection. But Al-Aly says that this was a misinterpretation of his findings. Even if most reinfections are milder, he says, they should still be taken seriously.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe key point here is that it\u2019s not zero risk,\u201d Al-Aly says. He likens it to the aftermath of a house fire. \u201cYou can\u2019t say to your spouse, \u2018I now know how to put out fire so let\u2019s put the house on fire again,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe your immune system is able to deal with it. But you know what\u2019s better? Not to have an infection in the first place.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Abu-Raddad agrees. His own research,\u00a0published in the\u00a0<i>New England Journal of Medicine<\/i>\u00a0earlier this month, shows that people who have been vaccinated and had a previous infection are about 97 percent less likely to get a severe, critical, or fatal reinfection. In other words, the risk is \u201creally, really small.\u201d But, he says, each subsequent infection increases a person\u2019s cumulative risk of harm from COVID-19.<\/p>\n<p>Osterholm says that more studies like Al-Aly\u2019s would help develop an understanding of how reinfections might compound the harms of COVID-19. For example, he says, it\u2019s possible that an infection could cause long-term inflammation in the blood vessels that could lead to the development of blood clots that could lead to increased risk for heart attacks or strokes. \u201cThat\u2019s an example of something we just need to really get a much better handle on,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<h2>What the evidence says about reinfections and long COVID<\/h2>\n<p>Also worrying to scientists is whether each new infection also carries the risk of developing long COVID\u2014a mysterious condition associated with a long list of disparate symptoms that\u00a0can last months to years after an initial infection. Even though long COVID\u2019s cause remains unknown, scientists hope to learn whether immunity confers some protection against it.<\/p>\n<p>So far, the evidence is mixed. A September 2021 study\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/journals\/laninf\/article\/PIIS1473-3099(21)00460-6\/fulltext#seccestitle150\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">published in\u00a0<i>The Lancet<\/i><\/a>\u00a0found that people who had received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccines were half as likely to develop long COVID symptoms as people who are unvaccinated\u2014suggesting that the vaccines do protect against it somewhat. However, a May 2022 study, also authored by Al-Aly and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41591-022-01840-0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">published in\u00a0<i>Nature Medicine<\/i><\/a>, suggests that vaccination only lowers the risk of developing long COVID symptoms by about 15 percent.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Al-Aly\u2019s most recent study suggests that long COVID is more prevalent in people with multiple infections than those who got sick only once. Abu-Raddad points out that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the second infection is more severe than the first\u2014it might just mean that each new infection is another opportunity for long COVID to strike.<\/p>\n<p>But scientists have to learn what causes long COVID before they can begin to grapple with whether reinfections play a role. Some researchers speculate that long COVID is caused by viral particles that linger in the body well after the acute phase of the disease has ended. Others suggest that it\u2019s caused by a pre-existing autoimmune disorder or perhaps an immune system that didn\u2019t reset properly after a previous illness. Krishna says he would be surprised if a second infection played an amplifying role in causing long COVID. Rather, he thinks it\u2019s more like a roll of the dice. \u201cEach time you roll, it\u2019s a chance you\u2019re going to get a chronic fatigue illness,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<h2>The big questions about reinfections<\/h2>\n<p>Scientists need more data before they can draw any conclusions about the severity of COVID-19 reinfections. Al-Aly says his next step is to investigate whether the variants that are dominating now\u2014BA.4 and BA.5\u2014are more likely to cause severe COVID-19 reinfections than others.<\/p>\n<p>Although the VA database is not perfect, he argues that its robust size provides an advantage for untangling the many variables in play: With millions of medical records on file, he\u2019ll be able to analyze reinfection in subgroups of people who only had, say, the Delta variant versus the Omicron variants. Will BA.4 and BA.5 be truly vaccine evasive? Will they lead to the same risk of long COVID? \u201cThese are open questions that we\u2019re all itching to know,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>Abu-Raddad would also like to see more studies that examine the clinical features of reinfections. This would be huge undertaking, however. To determine whether reinfections cause compound damage to the body, you would have to conduct a comprehensive screening of each person after each infection.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately scientists are going to need more time. Although the pandemic may seem long, at two and a half years so far, Krishna points out that it\u2019s still a relatively short time to study how antibodies respond to a virus. In another year and a half, we might find reinfections are much worse\u2014or we might get to a point where we have immunity for life.<\/p>\n<p>Osterholm notes that a variant or subvariant could emerge that would set up a whole new equation. \u201cEvery time we\u2019ve tried to out-guess this virus, it has caused us to second-guess ourselves,\u201d he warns. Still, he\u2019s optimistic that scientists will get a better handle on it.<\/p>\n<p>And, in the meantime, experts say there\u2019s plenty that people can do to protect themselves from this uncertainty: get vaccinated or boosted if you\u2019re eligible and take other sensible precautions, such as masking and avoiding situations with a high risk of exposure.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnytime we expose ourselves to reinfection, we are playing a very dangerous game,\u201d says Abu-Raddad. \u201cIt might be that specific infection that will end up being the very serious one.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A virologist at St Vincent&#8217;s Hospital&#8217;s Centre for Applied Medical Research in Sydney adjusts his personal protective equipment while researching the Omicron variant, on December 8, 2021.
