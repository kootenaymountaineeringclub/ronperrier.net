Only a few summits attain an elevation of 10,000&#8242;, the highest being Mt Findlay (10374). Most of what little mountaineering interest the area offers centres on those peaks in the vicinity of that mountain; see Findlay Group below. The only glacier of consequence lies on the E slope of this group, draining through the W tributaries of Findlay Creek. Coverage terminates at the line of St Mary River, S of which no significant mountaineering possibilities exist. The area was first mapped by M. Thorington in 1930 and 1931.<br \/>\nOn the watershed, they drain into Kootenay Lake via Carney and Fry Creek &#8211; both very long drainages accounting for the high water flows in Fry Creek Canyon in the spring. Both these drainages are difficult to access from the west with mammoth bushwhacks.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">From the S end of Toby Snowfield, the main water parting runs S and then E, reaching Saffron Peak in about 3 mi. Im\u00ad mediately S of Toby Snowfield there is a depression (7400) connecting the S fork ofToby Creek with a N branch of Carney Creek In 1964 a party (see Mt Pambrun), which traversed the Purcells via Toby and Carney Creeks, crossed the divide here. S of Saffron Peak, a low wooded pass (6900) leads over from the S terminal fork of Dutch Creek to the central branch of Camey Creek, the lowest crossing of the range between the Dogtooths and the head of St Mary River. 1\u00bd mi farther S rises Trikootenay Peak, the hydrographic apex of the Purcell Range. A small glacier on its NE side feeds the S terminal fork of Dutch Creek and is the glacial source of the Columbia River. S drainage from Trikootenay Peak is to Morigeau Creek, a tributary of Findlay Creek which is the Purcell source of Kootenay River. W drainage is via Carney and Fry Creeks to Kootenay Lake.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The watershed now swings W and S in an arc 3\u00bd mi long to Mt Findlay. Continuing S and then slightly E for some 5 mi, the divide goes over the principal summits of the Findlay mas\u00adsif. After running SE another 5 mi to Peak 9257&#8242;, the watershed makes a great semicircle facing NW in rounding the head of Fry Creek The divide then heads generally SW for 12 mi, passing over the S end of the Leaning Towers Group. At the point where it finally heads S again, paralleling the headwaters branch of St Mary River, the watershed is only 7\u00bd mi from Kootenay Lake.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>ACCESS<\/strong> to this region has traditionally been from the E, up either Dutch Creek from Fairmont Hot Springs or Findlay Creek from Canal Flats. Findlay Creek affords a better ap\u00adproach for reaching the central and most interesting peaks of the area, the Findlay Group. From Canal Flats, a road goes about 20 mi up the creek, but the condition of its lower sec\u00adtions is questionable. Some 5 mi before the end of the road, it is necessary to make a detour N, regaining the main road farther on. The last 2 mi are definitely passable only to jeeps or trucks. A trail (start unmarked) begins on the final downgrade of the jeep road and extends approximately 15 mi up the valley. The trail is rudimentary, in tum rocky, boggy, muddy and hard to follow in open slide areas. At 12 mi, a trail branches right (W) up Granite Creek whose source is the glacier on the E slope of the Findlay massif. After 2 mi, this trail splits again, the right<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">(N) branch going up Morigeau Creek to good campsites at its head. The left (S) branch continues along Granite Creek for another 2 mi. Although this last section is rocky and boggy, it is the logical choice to reach campsites well-located for climbing in the Findlay Group. Allow 2 days to backpack from the end of the road to the head of either Granite or Morigeau Creek.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Formerly, excursions on Dutch Creek began at the Hawke Ranch situated 4 mi W of Fairmont Hot Springs at the first acute bend of that stream. Today, however, a road branching N from the Findlay Creek road at approx 13 mi leads up Deer Creek and along Whitetail Lake, intersecting the trail on Dutch Creek near its second acute bend. This trail stays largely on the N and W sides of the valley, extending about 22 mi farther to the head of the S terminal fork beneath Trikootenay Peak. This old horse trail is indistinct and the ground is swampy. It is feasible to cross from the head of Dutch Creek over a saddle (8400) in the E ridge of Trikootenay Peak to the valley of Morigeau Creek and thus reach Findlay Glacier. And in fact, historically this approach route was followed on the FA of Mt Findlay. Nowadays, though, it would appear more reasonable to go in the reverse sense, from the Findlay massif, if one were interested in reaching the head of Dutch Creek.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The southern portions of this region are served by roads along St Mary River and various of its tributaries. From either Kimberley or Cranbrook, the principal road goes W to St Mary Lake and then NW some 13 additional mi to major forks. The main road takes the central fork and continues up Dewar Creek another 14 mj. The right (E) fork goes up White Creek, giving access to St Mary&#8217;s Alpine Park, an area dotted with lakes. The left (W) fork continues along St Mary River proper, extending to within about 6 mi of its head.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Maps:<\/strong> 82K\/l, 82F\/16.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Literature\u00a0<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Thorington, J.
