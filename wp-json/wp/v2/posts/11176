It covers 20,273 square kilometers (7,827\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and has a population of 2.07 million. One of the successor states of the former\u00a0Yugoslavia, Slovenia is a\u00a0parliamentary republic\u00a0and a member of the\u00a0United Nations, of the\u00a0European Union, and of\u00a0NATO.\u00a0The capital and largest city is\u00a0Ljubljana.<br \/>\nSlovenia has historically been the crossroads of\u00a0Slavic,\u00a0Germanic, and\u00a0Romance\u00a0languages and cultures.\u00a0Although the population is not homogeneous,\u00a0Slovenes\u00a0comprise the majority.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HISTORY <\/strong><br \/>\nHistorically, the current territory of Slovenia has formed part of many different states, including the\u00a0Roman Empire,\u00a0Byzantine Empire,\u00a0Carolingian Empire\u00a0and the\u00a0Holy Roman Empire, the\u00a0Habsburg Monarchy, the\u00a0Republic of Venice, the French-administered\u00a0Illyrian Provinces of Napoleon I, the\u00a0Austrian Empire\u00a0and\u00a0Austria-Hungary. In October 1918 the Slovenes exercised self-determination for the first time by co-founding the\u00a0State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. In December 1918 they merged with the\u00a0Kingdom of Serbia\u00a0into the\u00a0Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes\u00a0(renamed\u00a0Kingdom of Yugoslavia\u00a0in 1929).<br \/>\nDuring\u00a0World War II\u00a0(1939\u20131945)\u00a0Germany,\u00a0Italy, and\u00a0Hungary\u00a0occupied and annexed Slovenia (1941\u20131945), with a tiny area transferred to the\u00a0Independent State of Croatia, a\u00a0Nazi\u00a0puppet state.\u00a0In 1945 Slovenia became a founding member of the\u00a0Federal People&#8217;s Republic of Yugoslavia, renamed in 1963 as the\u00a0Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In the first years after World War II this state was initially allied with the\u00a0Eastern Bloc, but it never subscribed to the\u00a0Warsaw Pact\u00a0and in 1961 became one of the founders of the\u00a0Non-Aligned Movement.<br \/>\nIn June 1991, after the introduction of\u00a0multi-party\u00a0representative democracy, Slovenia\u00a0split from Yugoslavia\u00a0and became an independent country.\u00a0In 2004, it entered NATO and the European Union; in 2007 became the first\u00a0formerly communist\u00a0country to join the\u00a0Eurozone;\u00a0and in 2010 it joined the\u00a0OECD, a global association of high-income developed countries.<br \/>\n<strong>Etymology.<\/strong> Slovenia&#8217;s name means the &#8220;Land of the\u00a0Slavs&#8221; in\u00a0Slovene\u00a0and other\u00a0South Slavic languages. The etymology of\u00a0Slav\u00a0itself remains uncertain.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GEOGRAPHY <\/strong><br \/>\nSlovenia is situated in Central and Southeastern Europe touching the Alps and bordering the Mediterranean. It lies between latitudes\u00a045\u00b0\u00a0and\u00a047\u00b0 N, and longitudes\u00a013\u00b0\u00a0and\u00a017\u00b0 E. The\u00a015th meridian east\u00a0almost corresponds to the middle line of the country in the direction west-east.\u00a0Slovenia&#8217;s highest peak is\u00a0Triglav\u00a0(2,864\u00a0m or 9,396\u00a0ft); the country&#8217;s average height\u00a0above sea level\u00a0is 557\u00a0m (1,827\u00a0ft).<br \/>\nFour major European geographic regions meet in Slovenia: the\u00a0Alps, the\u00a0Dinarides, the\u00a0Pannonian Plain, and the\u00a0Mediterranean. Although on the shore of the\u00a0Adriatic Sea\u00a0near the\u00a0Mediterranean Sea, most of Slovenia is in the\u00a0Black Sea\u00a0drainage basin. The Alps\u2014including the Julian Alps, the Kamnik-Savinja Alps and the\u00a0Karawank\u00a0chain, as well as the Pohorje massif\u2014dominate Northern Slovenia along its long border with Austria. Slovenia&#8217;s Adriatic coastline stretches approximately 47 kilometres (29\u00a0mi)\u00a0from Italy to Croatia.<br \/>\nSlovenia has a mostly mountainous terrain\u00a0with a mainly\u00a0continental climate,\u00a0with the exception of the\u00a0Slovene Littoral, which has a sub-Mediterranean climate, and of the northwest, which has an\u00a0Alpine climate.\u00a0Additionally, the\u00a0Dinaric Alps\u00a0and the\u00a0Pannonian Plain\u00a0meet on the territory of Slovenia. The country, marked by a significant biological diversity,\u00a0is one of the most water-rich in Europe,\u00a0with a dense river network, a rich\u00a0aquifer\u00a0system, and significant\u00a0karst\u00a0underground watercourses.\u00a0Over half of the territory is covered by forest.\u00a0The human settlement of Slovenia is dispersed and uneven.<br \/>\nThe term &#8220;Karst topography&#8221; refers to that of southwestern Slovenia&#8217;s\u00a0Karst Plateau, a limestone region of underground rivers, gorges, and caves, between Ljubljana and the Mediterranean. On the Pannonian plain to the East and Northeast, toward the Croatian and Hungarian borders, the landscape is essentially flat. However, the majority of Slovenian terrain is hilly or mountainous, with around 90% of the surface 200\u00a0m (656\u00a0ft) or more\u00a0above sea level.<br \/>\nOver half of the country (11,823\u00a0km2) is covered by forests.\u00a0This makes Slovenia the third most forested country in Europe, after\u00a0Finland\u00a0and\u00a0Sweden. The areas are covered mostly by\u00a0beech,\u00a0fir-beech and beech-oak\u00a0forests and have a relatively high production capacity.\u00a0Remnants of primeval forests are still to be found, the largest in the\u00a0Ko\u010devje\u00a0area. Grassland covers 5,593\u00a0km2\u00a0and fields and gardens (954\u00a0km2). There are 363\u00a0km2\u00a0(140\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of orchards and 216\u00a0km2 of vineyards.<br \/>\n<strong>Geology.\u00a0<\/strong>Slovenia is in a rather active\u00a0seismic zone\u00a0because of its position on the small\u00a0Adriatic Plate, which is squeezed between the\u00a0Eurasian Plate\u00a0to the north and the\u00a0African Plate\u00a0to the south and rotates counter-clockwise.\u00a0Thus the country is at the junction of three important geotectonic units: the Alps to the north, the Dinaric Alps to the south and the Pannonian Basin to the east.\u00a0Scientists have been able to identify 60 destructive earthquakes in the past. Additionally, a network of seismic stations is active throughout the country.\u00a0Many parts of Slovenia have a carbonate ground, and an extensive subterranean system has developed.<br \/>\n<strong>Natural regions. <\/strong>The country consists of four\u00a0macroregions. These are the Alpine, the Mediterranean, the Dinaric, and the\u00a0Pannonian\u00a0landscapes. Macroregions are defined according to major relief units (the Alps, the Pannonian plain, the Dinaric mountains) and climate types (submediterranean, temperate continental, mountain climate). These are often quite interwoven.<br \/>\nProtected areas of Slovenia include national parks, regional parks, and nature parks, the largest of which is\u00a0Triglav National Park. There are 286\u00a0Natura 2000\u00a0designated protected areas, which comprise 36% of the country&#8217;s land area, the largest percentage among European Union states.\u00a0Slovenia is considered a &#8220;strong performer&#8221; in environmental protection efforts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ECONOMY<br \/>\n<\/strong>The\u00a0economy of Slovenia\u00a0is small, open and\u00a0export-oriented\u00a0and has been strongly influenced\u00a0by international conditions.\u00a0It has been severely hurt by the\u00a0Eurozone crisis\u00a0which started in 2009.\u00a0The main economic field is\u00a0services, followed by industry and construction.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TOURISM <\/strong><br \/>\nSlovenia offers tourists a wide variety of natural and cultural amenities. Different forms of tourism have developed. The tourist gravitational area is considerably large, however the tourist market is small. There has been no large-scale tourism and no acute environmental pressures;\u00a0in 2016,\u00a0National Geographic\u00a0Traveller&#8217;s Magazine declared Slovenia as country with the world&#8217;s most sustainable tourism.<br \/>\nThe nation&#8217;s capital, Ljubljana, has many important\u00a0Baroque\u00a0and\u00a0Vienna Secession\u00a0buildings, with several important works of the native born architect\u00a0Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik\u00a0and also his pupil, architect Edo Ravnikar.<br \/>\nAt the northwestern corner of the country lie the\u00a0Julian Alps\u00a0with\u00a0Lake Bled\u00a0and the\u00a0So\u010da\u00a0Valley, as well as the nation&#8217;s highest peak,\u00a0Mount Triglav\u00a0in the middle of\u00a0Triglav National Park. Other mountain ranges include\u00a0Kamnik\u2013Savinja Alps, the\u00a0Karawanks, and\u00a0Pohorje, popular with skiers and hikers.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Karst Plateau\u00a0in the\u00a0Slovene Littoral\u00a0gave its name to\u00a0karst, a landscape shaped by water dissolving the carbonate bedrock, forming caves. The best-known caves are\u00a0Postojna Cave\u00a0and the\u00a0UNESCO-listed\u00a0\u0160kocjan Caves. The region of\u00a0Slovenian Istria\u00a0meets the\u00a0Adriatic Sea, where the most important historical monument is the\u00a0Venetian Gothic\u00a0Mediterranean town of\u00a0Piran\u00a0while the settlement of\u00a0Portoro\u017e\u00a0attracts crowds in summer.<br \/>\nThe hills around Slovenia&#8217;s second-largest town,\u00a0Maribor, are renowned for their wine-making. The northeastern part of the country is rich with spas,\u00a0with\u00a0Roga\u0161ka Slatina,\u00a0Radenci,\u00a0\u010cate\u017e ob Savi,\u00a0Dobrna, and\u00a0Moravske Toplice\u00a0growing in importance in the last two decades.<br \/>\nOther popular tourist destinations include the historic cities of\u00a0Ptuj\u00a0and\u00a0\u0160kofja Loka, and several castles, such as the\u00a0Predjama Castle.<br \/>\nImportant parts of tourism in Slovenia include congress and\u00a0gambling tourism. Slovenia is the country with the highest percentage of\u00a0casinos\u00a0per 1,000\u00a0inhabitants in the European Union.\u00a0Perla\u00a0in\u00a0Nova Gorica\u00a0is the largest casino in the region.<br \/>\nMost of foreign tourists to Slovenia come from the key European markets:\u00a0Italy,\u00a0Austria, Germany,\u00a0Croatia,\u00a0Benelux,\u00a0Serbia,\u00a0Russia\u00a0and\u00a0Ukraine, followed by UK and\u00a0Ireland.\u00a0European tourists create more than 90% of Slovenia&#8217;s tourist income. In 2016, Slovenia was declared the world&#8217;s first green country by the Netherlands-based organization\u00a0Green Destinations.\u00a0On being declared the most sustainable country in 2016, Slovenia had a big part to play at the\u00a0ITB Berlin\u00a0to promote sustainable tourism.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DEMOGRAPHICS<br \/>\n<\/strong>With 101 inhabitants per square kilometer (262\/sq\u00a0mi), Slovenia ranks low among the European countries in population density (compared to 402\/km2 for the\u00a0Netherlands\u00a0or 195\/km2 for\u00a0Italy). The\u00a0Inner Carniola\u2013Karst Statistical Region\u00a0has the lowest population density while the\u00a0Central Slovenia Statistical Region\u00a0has the highest.<br \/>\nSlovenia is among the European countries with the most pronounced ageing of its population, ascribable to a low birth rate and increasing life expectancy.\u00a0Almost all Slovenian inhabitants older than 64 are retired, with no significant difference between the genders. The working-age group is diminishing in spite of immigration.\u00a0The proposal to raise the retirement age from the current 57 for women and 58 for men was rejected in a\u00a0referendum in 2011.\u00a0In addition, the difference among the genders regarding life expectancy is still significant.\u00a0The\u00a0total fertility rate\u00a0(TFR) in 2014 was estimated at 1.33 children born\/woman, which is lower than the replacement rate of 2.1.\u00a0The majority of children are born to unmarried women (in 2016, 58.6% of all births were outside of marriage).\u00a0In 2016, life expectancy was 78.2 years (74.6 years male, and 82 years female).<br \/>\nIn 2009, the\u00a0suicide rate\u00a0in Slovenia was 22 per 100,000 persons per year, which places Slovenia among the highest ranked European countries in this regard.\u00a0Nonetheless, from 2000 until 2010, the rate has decreased by about 30%. The differences between regions and the genders are pronounced.<\/p>\n<p><strong>LANGUAGES<br \/>\n<\/strong>The official language in Slovenia is\u00a0Slovene, which is a member of the\u00a0South Slavic language group. In 2002, Slovene was the native language of around 88% of Slovenia&#8217;s population according to the census, with more than 92% of the Slovenian population speaking it in their home environment.\u00a0This statistic ranks Slovenia among the most homogeneous countries in the EU in terms of the share of speakers of the predominant mother tongue.<br \/>\nSlovene is a highly diverse Slavic language in terms of\u00a0dialects,\u00a0with different degrees of mutual intelligibility. Accounts of the number of dialects range from as few as seven\u00a0dialects, often considered dialect groups or dialect bases that are further subdivided into as many as 50 dialects.<br \/>\nHungarian\u00a0and\u00a0Italian, spoken by the respective minorities, enjoy the status of official languages in the ethnically mixed regions along the Hungarian and Italian borders, to the extent that even the passports issued in those areas are bilingual. In 2002 around 0.2% of the Slovenian population spoke Italian and around 0.4% spoke Hungarian as their native language. Hungarian is co-official with Slovene in 30 settlements in 5 municipalities (whereof 3 are officially bilingual). Italian is co-official with Slovene in 25 settlements in 4 municipalities (all of them officially bilingual).<br \/>\nRomani,\u00a0spoken in 2002 as the native language by 0.2% of people, is a legally protected language in Slovenia. Romani-speakers mainly belong to the geographically dispersed and marginalized Roma community.<br \/>\nGerman, which used to be the largest minority language in Slovenia prior to World War II (around 4% of the population in 1921), is now the native language of only around 0.08% of the population, the majority of whom are more than 60 years old.\u00a0Gottscheerish\u00a0or\u00a0Granish, the traditional German dialect of\u00a0Gottschee County, faces extinction.<br \/>\nA significant number of people in Slovenia speak a variant of\u00a0Serbo-Croatian\u00a0(Serbian,\u00a0Croatian,\u00a0Bosnian, or\u00a0Montenegrin) as their native language. These are mostly immigrants who moved to Slovenia from other\u00a0former Yugoslav\u00a0republics from the 1960s to the late 1980s, and their descendants. In 2002, 0.4% of the Slovenian population declared themselves to be native speakers of\u00a0Albanian\u00a0and 0.2% native speakers of\u00a0Macedonian.\u00a0Czech, the fourth-largest minority language in Slovenia prior to World War II (after German, Hungarian, and Serbo-Croatian), is now the native language of a few hundred residents of Slovenia.<br \/>\nRegarding the knowledge of foreign languages, Slovenia ranks among the top European countries. The most taught foreign languages are English, German, Italian, French and Spanish. As of 2007, 92% of the population between the age of 25 and 64 spoke at least one foreign language and around 71.8% of them spoke at least two foreign languages, which was the highest percentage in the European Union.\u00a0According to the\u00a0Eurobarometer\u00a0survey, as of 2005\u00a0the majority of Slovenes could speak\u00a0Croatian\u00a0(61%) and English (56%).<br \/>\nA reported 42% of Slovenes could speak German, which was one of the highest percentages outside German-speaking countries.\u00a0Italian is widely spoken on the\u00a0Slovenian Coast\u00a0and in some other areas of the\u00a0Slovene Littoral. Around 15% of Slovenians can speak Italian, which is (according to the Eurobarometer pool) the third-highest percentage in the European Union, after Italy and\u00a0Malta.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ETHNIC COMPOSTION<br \/>\n<\/strong>According to the 2002 census, Slovenia&#8217;s main ethnic group are\u00a0Slovenes\u00a0(83%), however their share in the total population is continuously decreasing due to their relatively low\u00a0fertility rate. At least 13% (2002) of the population were immigrants from other parts of\u00a0Former Yugoslavia\u00a0and their descendants.\u00a0They have settled mainly in cities and suburbanised areas. Relatively small but protected by the\u00a0Constitution of Slovenia\u00a0are the\u00a0Hungarian\u00a0and the\u00a0Italian ethnic minority.\u00a0A special position is held by the autochthonous and geographically dispersed\u00a0Roma ethnic community.<br \/>\nThe number of people immigrating into Slovenia rose steadily from 1995\u00a0and has been increasing even more rapidly in recent years. After Slovenia joined the EU in 2004, the annual number of immigrants doubled by 2006 and increased by half yet again by 2009.\u00a0In 2007, Slovenia had one of the fastest growing\u00a0net migration rates\u00a0in the European Union.<\/p>\n<p><strong>EMIGRATION<br \/>\n<\/strong>As to emigration, between 1880 and 1918 (World War I) many men left Slovenia to work in mining areas in other nations. The United States in particular has been a common choice for emigration, with the 1910 US Census showing that there were already &#8220;183,431 persons in the USA of Slovenian mother tongue.\u00a0But there may have been many more, because a good number avoided anti-Slavic prejudice and &#8220;identified themselves as Austrians.&#8221; Favorite localities before 1900 were Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, as well as\u00a0Omaha, Nebraska,\u00a0Joliet, Illinois,\u00a0Cleveland, Ohio, and rural areas of Iowa. After 1910, they settled in Utah (Bingham Copper Mine), Colorado (especially Pueblo), and Butte, Montana. These areas attracted first many single men (who often boarded with Slovenian families). Then after locating work and having sufficient money, the men sent back for their wives and families to join them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>IMMIGRATION<br \/>\n<\/strong>In 2015 about 12% (237,616 people) of the population in Slovenia was born abroad.\u00a0About 86% of the foreign-born population originated from other countries of the former Yugoslavia state as (in descending order)\u00a0Bosnia-Herzegovina, followed by immigrants from\u00a0Croatia,\u00a0Serbia,\u00a0North Macedonia\u00a0and\u00a0Kosovo.<br \/>\nBy the beginning of 2017 there were about 114,438 people with a foreign citizenship residing in the country making up 5.5% of the total population. Of these foreigners 76% had citizenships of the other countries from the former Yugoslavia state (excluding Croatia). Additionally 16.4% had EU-citizenships and 7.6% had citizenships of other countries.<\/p>\n<p><strong>RELIGION<br \/>\n<\/strong>Roman Catholicism\u00a0(57.8%)<br \/>\nUndeclared (15.7%)<br \/>\nNon-religious\u00a0(10.2%)<br \/>\nUnknown (7.1%)<br \/>\nBeliever, no religion (3.5%)<br \/>\nIslam\u00a0(2.4%)<br \/>\nEastern Orthodoxy\u00a0(2.3%)<br \/>\nLutheranism\u00a0(0.8%)<br \/>\nOther religion (0.2%)<br \/>\nBefore World War II, 97% of the population declared itself\u00a0Catholic\u00a0(Roman Rite), around 2.5% as Lutheran, and around 0.5% of residents identified themselves as members of other denominations.<br \/>\nCatholicism was an important feature of both social and political life in pre-Communist Slovenia. After 1945, the country underwent a process of gradual but steady\u00a0secularization. After a decade of persecution of religions, the Communist regime adopted a policy of relative tolerance towards churches. After 1990, the Catholic Church regained some of its former influence, but Slovenia remains a largely secularized society. According to the 2002 census, 57.8% of the population is Catholic. In 1991, 71.6% were self-declared Catholics which means a drop of more than 1% annually.\u00a0The vast majority of Slovenian Catholics belong to the\u00a0Latin Rite. A small number of\u00a0Greek Catholics\u00a0live in the\u00a0White Carniola\u00a0region.<br \/>\nDespite a relatively small number of\u00a0Protestants\u00a0(less than 1% in 2002), the Protestant legacy is historically significant given that the Slovene standard language and Slovene literature were established by the\u00a0Protestant Reformation\u00a0in the 16th century.\u00a0Primoz Trubar, a theologian in the\u00a0Lutheran\u00a0tradition, was one of the most influential\u00a0Protestant Reformers\u00a0in Slovenia. Protestantism was extinguished in the\u00a0Counter-Reformation\u00a0implemented by the\u00a0Habsburg dynasty, which controlled the region. It only survived in the easternmost regions due to protection of Hungarian nobles, who often happened to be\u00a0Calvinist\u00a0themselves. Today, a significant\u00a0Lutheran\u00a0minority lives in the easternmost region of\u00a0Prekmurje, where they represent around a fifth of the population and are headed by a bishop with the seat in\u00a0Murska Sobota.<br \/>\nBesides these two Christian denominations, a small\u00a0Jewish community\u00a0has also been historically present. Despite the losses suffered during the\u00a0Holocaust, Judaism still numbers a few hundred adherents, mostly living in Ljubljana, site of the sole remaining active\u00a0synagogue\u00a0in the country<br \/>\nAccording to the 2002 census,\u00a0Islam\u00a0is the second largest religious denomination with around 2.4% of the population.
