The archipelago is made up of two populated islands, Madeira and Porto Santo, and two groups of unpopulated islands called the Desertas and Selvagens Islands. Geographically in\u00a0Africa, it is an ultra-peripheral region of the European Union. It is perhaps best known as the birthplace of the Portuguese football (soccer) player Cristiano Ronaldo.<br \/>\nKnown worldwide as the Islands of eternal spring, Madeira, &#8220;Ilha Jardim&#8221; (Garden Island) or &#8220;Pearl of the Atlantic&#8221;, has a mild climate throughout the entire year.<br \/>\nMadeira island is 500 km from the African coast and 1,000 km from the European continent, only 1.5 hr flight from mainland Portugal and about 3 hr from all the main countries in Europe.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CITIES<br \/>\n<\/strong>Listed around the island, counterclockwise from Funchal:<br \/>\n<strong>Funchal<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 Island capital and largest city in Madeira, home to tourist resorts, gorgeous panoramas, and local color.<br \/>\n<strong>Santa Cruz<\/strong>\u00a0\u2014 city and home of the Madeira airport<br \/>\nPaul do Mar\u00a0\u2014 scenic village on the west end of the island<br \/>\nCalheta\u00a0\u2014 town, home to one of the only working sugarcane mills \/ rum distilleries on<\/p>\n<p><strong>OTHER DESTINATIONS<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Porto Santo<\/strong><strong>.<\/strong> The nearby island<br \/>\n<strong>Selvagens Islands<\/strong>.

Its constant mild climate (20-27\u00b0C) keeps the spring on Madeira all year round. The levadas, an ingenious system of stone- and concrete-lined watercourses distributing water from the rainy north to the dry south, help flowers and crops flourish all year. That&#8217;s why this island is called the\u00a0Garden in the Atlantic. The maintenance pathways for these water canals provide wonderful level trails for hiking in the mountains (up to 1861 m) and through the tremendous landscape.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Get In<br \/>\nVisa.<\/strong> Same as the rest of Portugal, part of the\u00a0Schengen Area.<br \/>\n<strong>By plane. <\/strong>Cristiano Ronaldo Madeira International Airport (30 minutes from\u00a0Funchal): TAP Portugal, Portug\u00e1lia, SATA, British Airways + many more.<br \/>\nPorto Santo Airport\u00a0(PXO) is a 15-minute flight from Madeira.<br \/>\n<strong>By boat. <\/strong>Cruise ships\u00a0port here.

All other roads are narrow and often steep with ceaseless-seeming hairpin bends up mountains against oncoming traffic and usually with a sheer cliff face on one.

They need an\u00a0ecosystem\u00a0of high humidity, such as\u00a0cloud forests, with abundant rainfall throughout the year usually on tropical or subtropical\u00a0mountains. Laurel forests are typically multi-species, and diverse in both the number of species and the genera and families represented. Species diversity generally increases towards the tropics.\u00a0In this sense, the laurel forest is a transitional type between temperate forests and tropical rainforests.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The<\/span>\u00a0trees reach up to 40 metres (130\u00a0ft) in height.\u00a0Some species belong to the true laurel family, but many have similar foliage to the Lauraceae due to\u00a0convergent evolution and adapt to high rainfall and humidity &#8211; leaves that repel water due to a generous layer of\u00a0wax, making them glossy in appearance, and a narrow, pointed oval shape with an\u00a0apical mucro\u00a0or \u201cdrip tip\u201d, which permits the leaves to shed water despite the humidity, allowing perspiration and respiration.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Mature laurel forests typically have a dense\u00a0tree canopy\u00a0and low light levels at the forest floor.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Origin.\u00a0<\/strong>Laurel forests are composed of\u00a0vascular plants\u00a0that evolved millions of years ago including the southern beech.

Bring together a shared legacy based on heritage, linked to the routes of the Discoveries; the \u201c<em>New World<\/em>\u201d and the beginning of a new type of international trade and economic development; new geography and peoples; pioneering spirit, sailing and navigation; a new organisation of society and administration; new buildings (religious and defensive) and forms of artistic expression; cultural miscegenation and reciprocal influences, with the ocean being the main vehicle for the exchange of cultures and the progress of civilisations.<br \/>\nThese different places linked by the sea included the west coast of Africa, support points in North Africa, Atlantic islands, and the creation an innovative marketplace\/trading post.<br \/>\nThe starting point of what was to become a new era for humanity.<br \/>\nChronologically, beginning in 1415 with the occupation of Ceuta by the Portuguese, African coast \u2013 the Casa de Arguim (House of Arguin) and the Casa da Guin\u00e9 (House of Guinea) \u2013 moved from Lagos to Lisbon; and it ended in 1481, when private initiative was finally replaced by an effective regal monopoly on overseas trade, which created the conditions for the Portuguese and Castilians to finally show the Atlantic to Europe and the world in the explorations of the 1490s. The phase of globalisation corresponding to the \u201cPlaces of Globalisation\u201d covers the opening up of the commercial routes between the extreme south of Portugal and the west coast of Africa and the human occupation (colonisation) of the Atlantic islands. This process can be sub-divided into the following phases:<br \/>\nThe movement started with the conquest of Ceuta (1415), the key to the whole Mediterranean Sea, as Zurara wrote, a naval base for controlling the Strait of Gibraltar; and for the 14th century Arab historian, Ibn Khaldun, it was \u201cthe ideal starting point for people participating in the holy war\u201d. The occupation of other strongholds in North Africa followed.<br \/>\nA period of pure Atlantic privateering by members of the house of Prince Henry and on his initiative, which led to the occupation of the uninhabited archipelagos of Madeira, Azores and Cape Verde, and several attempts to conquer the Canary Islands and to round Cape Bojador (1434). New products appeared, especially the cultivation of sugar cane in Madeira, starting in 1452, which opened up a new segment of international business, archaeological evidence of which has also been discovered in Silves.<br \/>\nFrom 1443 onwards, slave trade and the first commercially acquired gold dust (in 1442) contributed to the beginning of a new cycle in Atlantic navigation. The first public sale of slaves happened in 1444, in Lagos, where later was created the House of Guinea, and the archaeological findings at Vale da Gafaria provide evidence of this trade. Also related to this trade is the Fortress of Arguin (Mauritania), established in 1449. Along with this trade was the search for western gold routes.<br \/>\nThe elements of heritage corresponding to the era of the first Portuguese overseas expeditions in the Atlantic represent exceptional evidence of the start of a new economic geography, which was very different to what had preceded it.<br \/>\nThis period in history was the catalyst for new commercial areas for Europe and of the first real global international trade, which started in Lagos, continued in Lisbon, and was then continued by Castile and by the Spanish Monarchy in Seville and the Low Countries (Bruges, Antwerp); the process was concluded by the hegemony of the Dutch (Amsterdam) and the English (London), who renewed it with a new economic geopolitics, and from which they profited from the 17th century onwards. In Portugal, the Barlavento (western Algarve) became the \u201cfirst quay\u201d \u2013 as it was emphatically called by the philosopher Agostinho Silva, and it was joined by places in the archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores.<br \/>\nIn the Azores, two geographic areas of particular importance were: Vila do Porto (Santa Maria) and Angra do Hero\u00edsmo (Terceira), which is already included in the World Heritage List.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Experiences<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Fado performance<br \/>\nTaste Cozido<br \/>\nTaste Francezinha<br \/>\nTaste Poncha<\/p>\n<p><strong>NOMAD MANIA Portugal \u2013 Madeira (Funchal, Porto Santo)<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong><em>World Heritage Sites<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Laurisilva of Madeira<br \/>\n<strong><em>Tentative WHS<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Levadas of Madeira Island<br \/>\nSites of Globalization<br \/>\n<strong><em>Borders: <\/em><\/strong>Madeira (sea border\/port)<br \/>\n<strong><em>XL<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Ilhas Desertas<br \/>\nIlhas Selvagens<br \/>\n<strong><em>Railway, Metro, Funiculars, Cable Cars: <\/em><\/strong>Portugal Intercity Railway Experience<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Islands<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">MADEIRA<\/span><br \/>\n<em>Railway, Metro, Funiculars, Cable Cars: <\/em><\/strong>Madeira Cable Car<br \/>\n<strong><em>Museums: <\/em><\/strong>Madeira: Museu de Baleia<br \/>\n<strong><em>World of Nature: <\/em><\/strong>Madeira Natural Park<br \/>\n<strong><em>Botanical Gardens<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Madeira Botanical Garden<br \/>\nMonte Palace Tropical Garden<br \/>\n<strong><em>Waterfalls:\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>Risco Waterfall<br \/>\n<strong><em>European Cities<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong><strong>FUNCHAL <\/strong>World Cities and Popular Towns<br \/>\n<strong><em>Airports: <\/em><\/strong>Funchal (Madeira) (FNC)<br \/>\n<strong><em>Museums<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Madeira Optics Museum<br \/>\nMadeira Story Centre<br \/>\nMuseu Cristiano Ronaldo (Museu CR7)<br \/>\nMuseu do Brinquedo<br \/>\nQuinta das Cruzes Museum<br \/>\nUniverso de Memorias<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Henrique and Francisco Franco Museum<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Military Museum<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Museu A Cidade do A\u00e7\u00facar<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Museu de Historia Natural do Funchal<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Museu do Bordado<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Sacred Art Museum<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Museu de Baleia<br \/>\n<\/span><strong><em>House Museums\/Plantations: <\/em><\/strong>Casa Museu Frederico de Freitas<br \/>\n<strong><em>Religious Temples<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Jesuit&#8217;s College (Church of Saint John the Evangelist)<br \/>\nS\u00e9 Catedral<br \/>\n<strong><em>Hospitality Legends: <\/em><\/strong>Belmond Reid&#8217;s Palace Hotel<strong><em><br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>Villages and Small Towns:\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>Jardim do Mar (Madeira)<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">PORTO SANTO\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">M@P<br \/>\n<\/span><strong><em>Airports: <\/em><\/strong>Porto Santo (PXO)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Madeira\u00a0is a sub-tropical archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean and an autonomous region of\u00a0Portugal.
