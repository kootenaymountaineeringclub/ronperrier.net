It falls below the level of the plateau surface surrounding it about 50 meters. The length of this depression ranges between 5, 55 and 60\u00a0km, while its average width is 10\u00a0km, and its deepest point reaches 24 meters below sea level. It is a depression and not a valley, because the region is a closed depression that has a beginning and an end, and it has no source, estuary or tributaries, so the launch of the word &#8220;Wadi&#8221; on the depression is not topographically correct.<br \/>\nThe Wadi contains 12 lakes, the total surface area of which is 10\u00a0km square and their average depth is only 2 m. The color of these lakes is reddish blue because its water is saturated with the\u00a0Natron\u00a0salt.<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-Gauthier56_8-1\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>History. The importance of the Natrun valley dates back to the Pharaonic era, as the\u00a0ancient Egyptian\u00a0and the\u00a0Libyans\u00a0fought their many battles.

Hermit monks believed that desert life would teach them to eschew the things of this world and follow\u00a0God&#8217;s call. Between the 4th and 7th century AD, hundreds of thousands of people from the world over joined the hundreds of Christian\u00a0monasteries\u00a0in the Nitrian Desert, centered on Nitria, Kellia and Scetis (Wadi El Natrun).<br \/>\nSaint\u00a0Macarius of Egypt\u00a0first came to Scetis (Wadi El Natrun) around 330 AD where he established a solitary monastic site.\u00a0His reputation attracted a loose band of\u00a0anchorites,\u00a0hermits,\u00a0and\u00a0monks\u00a0who settled nearby in individual cells. Many of them came from nearby Nitria and Kellia where they had previous experience in solitary desert living. At its peak the place contained 700 monasteries. The monasteries flourished during the\u00a0Muslim conquest of Egypt\u00a0(639\u2013642), but in the eighth and ninth centuries\u00a0taxation\u00a0and administration concerns led to conflicts with the\u00a0Muslim\u00a0government.\u00a0Nitria and Kellia were eventually abandoned in the 7th and 9th centuries respectively, but Scetis continued throughout the Medieval period.\u00a0Although some of the individual monasteries were eventually abandoned or destroyed, four have remained in use to the present day: Monastery of Saint Macarius the Great, Paromeos Monastery, Monastery of Saint Pishoy, and the Syrian Monastery.<br \/>\nTo this day Wadi El Natrun remains the most important center of Coptic\u00a0monasticism.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\">[12]<br \/>\n<\/sup><span id=\"Saint-Exup.C3.A9ry.27s_plane_crash\"><\/span><span id=\"Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's_plane_crash\" class=\"mw-headline\">Saint-Exup\u00e9ry&#8217;s plane crash.\u00a0<\/span>The environs of Wadi Natrun have been identified as the likely site of where the plane of French aviator\u00a0Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\u00a0crashed on December 30, 1935.

A common origin by wind deflation to a base level controlled by the groundwater table, is the generally accepted explanation. It is a closed inland basin bounded from the north and west by steep escarpments, an area of 19,500 sq. km, and an average depth of 60 m below sea level (bsl); the lowest point, lat the SW part, being 134 m BSL. Within the Depression, cones, towers, mushrooms, and plateau-like hills, ranging in height from 5 to 30 m, are common, especially near the western scarp. Sinkholes and caves are also common in the northern Diffa Plateau, separating the Depression from the Mediterranean frontal plain. The northern and western escarpments are dominated by large mass-wasted blocks and complex dune belts are in the southern part. Near the SW, the dunes are black, named El-Ghorood El-Sood (= black dunes), due to their high content of black shale fragments, derived from the Dabaa Formation. Since the Qattara Depression forms the deepest point in the Western Desert, groundwater flow in all aquifers bordering the area is consequently directed to this final base level. Most of the groundwater comes from the Moghra Aquifer system, recharged from four sources: the Nubia Sandstone aquifer in the south, Nile water in the east, saline water from the Mediterranean Sea to the north, and rainwater. The near-surface groundwater ranges in salinity (mostly sodium chloride) from 3.3 g\/l around the Moghra Lake, to 38.4 g\/l at the center, to about 300 g\/l in the sabkha area to the west.<br \/>\n<strong><em>2. The Great Sand Sea<\/em><\/strong> The Great Sand Sea is one of the largest unbroken mass of sand dune areas of the world, and home to not one living soul. It spans 650 km between Siwa Oasis in the north and the Gilf Kebir Plateau in the south. Its average width is about 300 km from the Libyan border to the west and Farafra Oasis Depression to the east. Parallel dune ridges run north-south for hundreds of kilometers. There is not a single water point in the whole area. Totaling the size of England, the sand accumulation varies in shape, color, and geologic origin from one place to another. In the northern region of the dunes, south of Siwa, there is minor greenery, with calcareous outcroppings that reveal the marine origin of the strata. Further south and towards the central parts of the dune field, is a land of pristine sands with undulating whaleback dunes and minor crest dunes. Through this central region patrols of the British Long Range Desert Group made their way to attack German posts in Libya, during the early years of WWII. There are more than 60-year old tire tracks are still visible on certain surfaces.<br \/>\nIn the west is enigmatic silica glass \u2013 ultra-pure glass, 98% silica &#8211; believed by some to be the result of a meteoritic impact. It lies about 50 km from the Libyan border, between two dune ridges 200 m high. It is the world\u2019s only known field of silica glass. Some chunks weigh 5 kg, half-buried like icebergs in the reddish sand. Some lying windblown on the desert floor, scoured by millennia of sand storms, into lustrous prisms of glass. Over a thousand tons of it are strewn across hundreds of kilometers of bleak desert. Some of the chunks weigh 26 kilograms, but most exist in smaller, angular pieces looking like sherds left when a giant green bottle is smashed by colossal forces.<br \/>\n<strong><em>3. Wadi Sannur<\/em><\/strong> Cave Wadi Sannur Cave was discovered during blasting for alabaster in the famous alabaster quarries, 70 kms southeast of the city of Beni Suef, in the Eastern Desert of Egypt. These quarries produce some of the finest alabaster material the world has ever known, and it is from these quarries that the Ancient Egyptians fabricated the wonderful alabaster ware, like those found in King Tutankhamon\u2019s tomb. It contains stalactites and stalagmitic formations. Such caves are extremely rare in arid environments and are therefore useful for understanding the geological history of these regions and the evolution of their paleoclimatology, their geohydrology, their geomorphology, and their biota.<\/p>\n<p><em>The bus arrived at Marsa Matruh at 1:25 and the bus to Siwa departed at 1:35, as advertised on the Internet (3.5 hours, 80LE).

The Siwa oasis is in a deep\u00a0depression\u00a0that reaches below sea level, to about \u221219 metres (\u221262\u00a0ft). To the west, the\u00a0Jaghbub\u00a0oasis rests in a similar depression and to the east, the large\u00a0Qattara Depression\u00a0is also below sea level.<br \/>\nAlthough the oasis is known to have been settled since at least the\u00a010th millennium BC, the earliest evidence of any connection with\u00a0Ancient Egypt\u00a0is the\u00a026th Dynasty, when a\u00a0necropolis\u00a0was established.\u00a0Ancient Greek\u00a0settlers at\u00a0Cyrene\u00a0made contact with the oasis around the same time (7th century BC), and the oracle temple of\u00a0Amun\u00a0took the image here of a ram.\u00a0During his campaign to conquer the\u00a0Persian Empire,\u00a0Alexander the Great\u00a0reached the oasis, supposedly by following birds across the desert.<br \/>\nThe Siwans are a Berber people, so demographically and culturally they were more closely related to nearby Libya, which has a large Berber population, than to Egypt, which has a negligible Berber population.<br \/>\nSiwa was also the site of some fighting during\u00a0World War I\u00a0and\u00a0World War II. The\u00a0British Army&#8217;s\u00a0Long Range Desert Group\u00a0(LRDG) was based here, but Rommel&#8217;s\u00a0Afrika Korps\u00a0also took possession three times. German soldiers went\u00a0skinny dipping\u00a0in the lake of the oracle, contrary to local customs which prohibit public nudity.\u00a0In 1942 while the Italian\u00a0136th Infantry Division Giovani Fascisti\u00a0occupied the oasis, a tiny Egyptian puppet government-in-exile was set up at Siwa.<br \/>\nThe ancient fortress of Siwa was built on natural rock and made of kershif (salt and mud-brick) and palm logs. After it was damaged by three days of heavy rains in 1926\u00a0it was abandoned for similar unreinforced construction housing on the plain surrounding it. Only one building in the Shali complex has been repaired and is in use, a mosque. Gradually eroded by infrequent rains and slowly collapsing, the Shali remains a prominent feature, towering five stories above the modern town and lit at night by floodlights.<br \/>\nOther local historic sites of interest include the remains of the oracle temple; the Gebel al Mawta (the Mountain of the Dead), a Roman-era necropolis featuring dozens of rock-cut tombs;\u00a0and &#8220;Cleopatra&#8217;s Bath&#8221;, an antique natural spring. The fragmentary remains of the oracle temple, with some inscriptions dating from the 4th century BC, lie within the ruins of Aghurmi.<br \/>\nThe traditional culture of Siwa shows many unique elements, some reflecting its longstanding links with the isolated Oasis life and the fact that the inhabitants are Siwi Berbers. Until a tarmac road was built to the Mediterranean coast in the 1980s Siwa&#8217;s only links with the outside world were by arduous camel tracks through the desert. These were used to export dates and olives, bring trade goods, or carry pilgrims on the route which linked the Maghreb to Cairo and hence to Mecca.<br \/>\nAs a result of this isolation, Siwis developed a unique natural culture manifested in its crafts of basketry, pottery, silverwork, and embroidery and in its style of dress. The most visible and celebrated examples of this were the bridal silver and the ensemble of silver ornaments and beads that women wore in abundance to weddings and other ceremonies.\u00a0The best known of these pieces is a huge silver disc called &#8216;adrim&#8217; and a torc, called &#8216;aghraw&#8217; from which it hung over the breast. A girl would give up the disc at a special ceremony in the Spring the day she was married. The jewelry, which was made by local silversmiths, consisted of silver necklaces, earrings, bangles, hair ornaments, pendants, and many rings. For a wealthy woman, the full ensemble could weigh as much as five or six kilos.<br \/>\nSiwi people are very religious so on\u00a0Ramadan, they tend to close all the shops and stay at home for the whole month.<br \/>\nThe Siyaha Festival (Eid El Solh &#8211; Eid El Hasad), in honour of the town&#8217;s traditional patron saint Sidi Sulayman, is unique to Siwa. Siwi men meet together on a mountain near the town, Gabal Al &#8211; Dakrour, to eat together, sing chants thanking God, and reconcile with one another; After Dohr prayer (12:00 PM) all Siwian youth gather to set the banquet, nobody is allowed to eat before the caller announces to start eating so they can all eat together, the women stay behind in the village, and celebrate with dancing, singing, and drums. Celebrations last for 3 Qamari days, and in the early morning of the fourth day, siwian men form a big march, while holding flags and singing spiritual songs, march sarts from Gabal El &#8211; Dakrour and ends in Sidi Solayman square &#8211; in the center of Siwa &#8211; declaring ending of festivals, and beginning of a new year without hatred or grudge, and with love, respect and reconciliation.<br \/>\nSiwans are preferentially\u00a0endogamous, only rarely marrying non-Siwans. Nonetheless, Bedouin brides command a higher bride price\u00a0in Siwa than Siwan ones.<br \/>\nSiwan homosexual tradition. Siwa is of special interest to anthropologists and sociologists because of its historical acceptance of male\u00a0homosexuality\u00a0and even rituals celebrating\u00a0same-sex marriage\u00a0&#8211; traditions that the Egyptian authorities have sought to repress, with increasing success, since the early twentieth century. The German Egyptologist\u00a0Georg Steindorff\u00a0explored the Oasis in 1900 and reported that homosexual relations were common and often extended to a form of marriage: &#8220;The feast of marrying a boy was celebrated with great pomp, and the money paid for a boy sometimes amounted to fifteen pounds, while the money paid for a woman was a little over one pound.&#8221; Although Siwan men could take up to four wives, Siwan customs allow a man but one boy to whom he is bound by a stringent code of obligations.&#8221;<br \/>\nIn 1937 the anthropologist Walter Cline wrote the first detailed ethnography of the Siwans in which he noted: &#8220;All normal Siwan men and boys practice sodomy&#8230;among themselves, the natives are not ashamed of this; they talk about it as openly as they talk about the love of women, and many if not most of their fights arise from homosexual competition. Prominent men lend their sons to each other. Most of the boys used in sodomy are between twelve and eighteen years of age.\u00a0After an expedition to Siwa, the archaeologist Count Byron de Prorok reported in 1937 &#8220;an enthusiasm [that] could not have been approached even in Sodom&#8230; Homosexuality was not merely rampant, it was raging&#8230;Every dancer had his boyfriend&#8230;[and] chiefs had harems of boys&#8221;.<br \/>\nIn the late 1940s a Siwan merchant told the visiting British novelist\u00a0Robin Maugham\u00a0that the Siwan women were &#8220;badly neglected&#8221;, but that Siwan men &#8220;will kill each other for a boy. Never for a woman&#8221;, although as Maugham noted, marriage to a boy had become illegal by then.\u00a0In 1973 that &#8220;While the Siwans were still living inside their walled town, none of these bachelors was allowed to spend the night in the town and had to sleep outside the gates&#8230;Under such circumstances, it is not surprising that homosexuality was common among them&#8230;.Up to the year 1928, it was not unusual that some kind of written agreement, which was sometimes called a marriage contract, was made between two males. However, such agreements continued, but in great secrecy, and without the actual writing, until the end of World War II. Now the practice is not followed.<br \/>\nAgriculture\u00a0is the main activity of modern Siwa, particularly the cultivation of\u00a0dates\u00a0and\u00a0olives. Tourism has in recent decades become a vital source of income.<\/p>\n<p><em>I walked the 1 km to my hotel, the Dream Lodge. Siwa in this part of town is a little depressing: dirt roads, garbage, lots of little kids saying \u201chello mister\u201d, and not very attractive houses. I had booked a shared bathroom (450LE\/nite) but was given a nice room with a bathroom and AC. The mistake was realized and I was shown the other room. Wow, what a difference. The other was the size of my bed, and bare except for two nasty single beds and no AC. So I paid 200LE\/nite extra and moved up in the world.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Day 8<\/span><br \/>\n<strong>Siwa archaeological area<\/strong> Tentative WHS (01\/11\/1994).

The visit by Alexander the Great in 331 BC gave it historical significance.<br \/>\nWalk up the dirt steps through a \u201ctunnel\u201d framed by logs and palm planks. The temple is constructed of dressed limestone blocks, has 4 rooms, and has signs of some reconstruction in the door frames and corners.<br \/>\nThe mosque has been totally finished inside. The log\/plank ceiling is supported by 3 large columns. Six small windows view out to the village. The tower can\u2019t be accessed.<br \/>\nThere are great views of the Salt Lake to the north, buttes, and ridges to the southwest and to the south, Siwa with the lake behind it. The entire area is a sea of palm trees.<br \/>\nI walked north to the edge of the Salt Lake, here a dry bed with water a long ways away. Seeing as I had no idea where the swimming areas were, I turned around and went to Cleopatra Springs. A kid on a cart pulled by a small donkey offered a ride. He kept whipping the donkey who had a big sore covered in flies on his back. We stopped at the <strong>Temple of Om Obaideh<\/strong>, with a ruined wall. Built in the reign of King Nectandro II (359-341 BC) for the worship of Arun. It has Pharaonic\/Greek\/Roman elements.<br \/>\nI finally got tired of him, go off and he demanded 50LE. I gave him 5 and walked the short distance to the springs. <strong>Cleopatra Springs<\/strong> is a large round pool enclosed in stone walls. Several were swimming. I talked to two young German women and one of their fathers who had rented a car and drove here from Cairo. They were going to swim in Salt Lake and offered me a ride. We followed a guide in another vehicle. Skirting the east side of the lake, the road then crosses a causeway. We entered a large area of salt mining, bucket loaders, trucks, and piles of salt everywhere. The extraction process produces many rectangular lakes with salt crystals on the edges and extending into the pools. We all went for a swim although swimming is virtually impossible with the high buoyancy. The best is to lay on your back and backstroke. The water was surprisingly cool.<br \/>\nWe then drove back to town where I saw Old Siwa.<br \/>\n<strong>Siwa Archaeological Area<\/strong> (Shali \u2013 Old Siwa). Close to downtown, this sits on top of another small hill. Take stairs up through a few functional houses to the top, all melting mud-brick structures except for the 4-6 foot perimeter wall that has been maintained. It is a warren of small paths through the disintegrating walls. There are nice views of the entire town.<\/p>\n<p><em>I had a shower to wash off all the salt and spent the evening writing, reading, and getting ready for my bus ride to Alexandria at 7 am (155LE).
