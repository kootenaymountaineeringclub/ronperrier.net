Once gravity causes a star to collapse on itself,\u00a0it will take another 100 million years for a\u00a0star to deflate and form a persistent red cloud. Eventually, around 10 million years later, all that is left is a hot core of carbon and gasses that form a &#8220;planetary nebula.&#8221; As the star further burns out, it will diminish into a white dwarf planet.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"sc-2bebabdd-0 ehakUn\"><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\">What Happens When a Star Dies?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\">But while the sun may seem huge from our vantage point, it&#8217;s considered a baby in terms of stars. And bigger stars go out with a bigger bang. The death of a larger star, for example, around 10 times as bright as the sun, results in a supernova explosion, the biggest explosion we humans have ever seen. And supernova explosions happen in a matter of seconds.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"sc-94ccee78-0 hZzYvV\"><strong><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\">Supernova Star vs. Smaller Star Explosions<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\">According to<\/span><a class=\"sc-acb0869a-0 cgZEsQ sc-7c45e65b-0 ccUAyS\" href=\"https:\/\/spaceplace.nasa.gov\/supernova\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\">\u00a0NASA<\/span><\/a><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\">, a supernova star is considered the &#8220;last hurrah of a dying star.&#8221; The nuclear fuel burning at the core of a massively bright star causes so much heat, pressure and energy that the star isn&#8217;t able to collapse like a smaller star because the intense pressure at its core is still fighting the gravity pushing inward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\">Eventually, just like the smaller star, the fuel of a supernova star will run out and gravity will succeed in crushing the star&#8217;s core. It happens so rapidly that it creates intense shock waves throughout the galaxy. It can even cause the formation of a black hole, the densest portion of the solar system when gravity is pulling so hard that even light isn&#8217;t able to escape.<\/p>\n<p><\/span><strong><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\">Exploding Supernovas<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p data-skm-boomerang-el-1=\"processed\"><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\">In Nov. 2022, the<\/span><a class=\"sc-acb0869a-0 cgZEsQ sc-7c45e65b-0 ccUAyS\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/feature\/goddard\/2022\/hubble-captures-3-faces-of-evolving-supernova-in-early-universe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\">\u00a0Hubble Space Telescope<\/span><\/a><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\"> captured a supernova explosion that happened 11 billion years ago, when the universe was a fifth of the age that it is today.

An eruption of cyanobacteria, sometimes called blue-green algae, filled our atmosphere with oxygen, creating a world where multicellular life-forms could take hold, and where creatures like humans could ultimately breathe.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\">However, one of Earth\u2019s great die-offs, an event 450 million years ago called the Late Ordovician mass extinction, likely happened because the inverse took place. The planet saw a sudden drop in oxygen levels that lasted for several million years.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\">What could have caused such an extreme event? During the Ordovician period, the continents were one jumbled mass called Gondwana. Most life on Earth still lived in the oceans, but plants were beginning to emerge on land. Then, near the end of the Ordovician, a sweeping climate shift left the supercontinent covered with glaciers. That global cooling alone was enough to start killing off species.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\">But then a second pulse of the extinction ramped up as oxygen levels plummeted. Scientists see evidence of this shift in seafloor samples collected from around the world.

Over the years, numerous astronomers have suggested\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"sc-acb0869a-0 cgZEsQ sc-7c45e65b-0 ccUAyS\" href=\"https:\/\/www.aps.org\/publications\/apsnews\/200407\/extinction.cfm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\">the culprit might have been a gamma-ray burst<\/span><\/a><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\"> (GRB).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\">GRBs are mysterious events that seem to be the most violent and energetic explosions in the cosmos, and astronomers suspect they\u2019re tied to extreme supernovas. However (and thankfully), we haven\u2019t yet seen a burst close enough to us to fully understand what&#8217;s going on. So far, GRBs have only been spotted in other galaxies.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\">But if one did happen in the Milky Way, as has likely happened in the past, it could cause a mass extinction on Earth.\u00a0A GRB pointed in our direction might last just 10 seconds or so, but it could still destroy at least half Earth&#8217;s ozone in that short period of time. As humans have learned in recent decades, even a relatively\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"sc-acb0869a-0 cgZEsQ sc-7c45e65b-0 ccUAyS\" href=\"https:\/\/www.discovermagazine.com\/environment\/whatever-happened-to-the-hole-in-the-ozone-layer\"><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 jfFgeV\">small amount of ozone depletion<\/span><\/a><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\">\u00a0is enough to chip away at our planet\u2019s natural sunscreen, causing serious problems. Wiping out the ozone on a large enough scale could wreak havoc on food chains, killing off huge numbers of species.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\">A GRB would wipe out the lifeforms that live in the upper levels of the ocean, which currently contribute significant amounts of oxygen to our atmosphere. And, it turns out, gamma rays also break apart atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen. These gasses get converted into nitrogen dioxide, which is more commonly known as the smog that blocks out the Sun above heavily polluted cities. Having this smog blanketing the entire Earth would block out sunshine and kickstart a global ice age.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"sc-202ecc93-0 gAMfTf\">\n<div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"sc-e706b2c9-0 hIuHOm\" src=\"https:\/\/images.ctfassets.net\/cnu0m8re1exe\/HtR2jjWMEAHFoh6elDO4I\/4104b4e1e0e031696497d744ea030a9e\/sun_1-1024x1024.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;fl=progressive&amp;w=660&amp;h=433&amp;fit=pad\" alt=\"Sun Solar Flares - NASA\" width=\"433px\" height=\"660px\" \/><\/div>\n<div class=\"sc-202ecc93-1 dqnBTe\">Eventually, the aging Sun&#8217;s emissions will be so intense that it wipes out the oxygen in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere.

Gamma-ray burst or not, in about a billion years, most life on Earth will eventually die anyway due to a lack of oxygen. That\u2019s according to a different study published in March in the journal\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"sc-acb0869a-0 cgZEsQ sc-7c45e65b-0 ccUAyS\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41561-021-00693-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 dtwoNH\">Nature Geoscience<\/span><\/a><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\">The researchers suggest that our oxygen-rich atmosphere is not a permanent feature of the planet. Instead, in about a billion years, solar activity will cause atmospheric oxygen to plummet back down to the level it was at before the Great Oxidation Event. To determine this, the authors combined climate models and biogeochemistry models to simulate what will happen to the atmosphere as the Sun ages and puts out more energy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\">They found that, eventually, Earth reaches a point where atmospheric carbon dioxide breaks down. At that point, oxygen-producing plants and organisms that rely on photosynthesis will die out. Our planet won\u2019t have enough lifeforms to sustain the oxygen-rich atmosphere humans and other animals require.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\">The precise timing of when that starts and how long it takes \u2014 the deoxygenation process could take as few as 10,000 years \u2014 depends on a broad range of factors. But, in the end, the authors say this cataclysm is an unavoidable one for the planet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\">Luckily, humanity still has another billion years to figure out other plans.<br \/>\n======================================================<\/span><\/p>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 18pt;\">Why Is Space So Dark Even Though The Universe Is Filled With Stars?<br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Brian Jackson, Boise State University<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"sc-87d213a0-0 gdbaPI\">\n<div class=\"sc-43817e5f-0 kiMuaE\">\n<div class=\"sc-202ecc93-0 fHxosg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"sc-e706b2c9-0 hIuHOm\" src=\"https:\/\/images.ctfassets.net\/cnu0m8re1exe\/ADVygtApgslnb4SZKEeir\/d0100413840bd0e3b573b4264d6d00b2\/shutterstock_1449449645.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;fl=progressive&amp;w=660&amp;h=433&amp;fit=fill\" alt=\"Milky Way in the night sky\" width=\"433px\" height=\"660px\" \/><\/div>\n<article class=\"sc-426c7a0c-0 kFFBpt\" data-skm-boomerang-el-1=\"processed\"><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\">People have been asking why space is dark despite being filled with stars for so long that this question has a special name \u2013\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"sc-acb0869a-0 cgZEsQ sc-7c45e65b-0 ccUAyS\" href=\"https:\/\/lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov\/product\/suborbit\/POLAR\/cmb.physics.wisc.edu\/tutorial\/olbers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\">Olbers\u2019 paradox<\/span><\/a><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\">Astronomers estimate that there are about\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"sc-acb0869a-0 cgZEsQ sc-7c45e65b-0 ccUAyS\" href=\"https:\/\/theconversation.com\/how-many-stars-are-there-in-space-165370\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\">200 billion trillion stars<\/span><\/a><span class=\"sc-4df7a8a0-0 kkhobw\">\u00a0in the observable universe.
