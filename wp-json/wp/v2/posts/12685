Fly Freeport to Nassau &#8211; $CAD112.<\/p>\n<p>The Bahamas are an archipelago of about 2,000 islands if you include the cays, which are small islands that are formed on coral reefs in the Atlantic Ocean east of\u00a0Florida. Not densely populated, the Bahamas is renowned for its natural beauty, unique culture, and is a popular tropical vacation destination.<br \/>\nThe word\u00a0Bahamas\u00a0is of Spanish origin and means &#8220;Shallow Water&#8221;.<em><br \/>\nNote:\u00a0The areas of Abacos and the Grand Bahama Islands are largely destroyed following the effects of\u00a0Hurricane Dorian, which made landfall on both islands on September 1, 2019. Travel in and out of the islands is difficult and will be off limits for travelers for the coming weeks. Water supply is disrupted due to freshwater wells contaminated with seawater. Roads are peppered by debris and access to tourist spots is essentially blocked. Additionally,\u00a0NHC forecasts and warnings\u00a0state that a tropical storm, Humberto, will be in the area around September 14, 2019.<\/em><br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nVisa.\u00a0<\/strong>Almost all Western countries do not require a visa<strong><br \/>\nCapital:<\/strong> Nassau<br \/>\n<strong>Currency:<\/strong> Bahamian Dollar (BSD)\u00a0(B$), but it&#8217;s tied to the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio and US dollars are accepted everywhere at par.<br \/>\n<strong>Population:<\/strong> 337,000<br \/>\n<strong>Language.<\/strong> English<br \/>\n<strong>Accommodation &#8211;\u00a0<\/strong>expensive, virtually no backpacker\/hostel-type lodging. The cheapest hotels start at around US$ 70, and most hotels cost US$200-300\/night, with the very best resorts easily pushing up above US$500. Deals may be available in the summer off-season though.<br \/>\nBe aware the Bahamas charge a\u00a0Service Fee or Resort Fee\u00a0to every person staying overnight. Hotels collect the fee of\u00a0$18 per night per person\u00a0as well as a\u00a0$6 per person one time bellhop fee. This is an addition to the rate of the room and is not optional and cannot be waived. Often tourists first hear about this when checking into their hotel for the first time.<br \/>\nThe Bahamas Government levies a\u00a0Hotel Guest Tax\u00a0which is payable by each guest. This tax is\u00a010%\u00a0of the hotel rate, it submitted monthly to the Bahamas Government by the hotel operator.<br \/>\nHotels in the Bahamas may levy a number of\u00a0other charges\u00a0upon guests in addition to the standard bill, including; gratuities-maid\/bellman), a hotel &#8216;Levy&#8217; (Promotion Board), cable, telephone, water &amp; sewerage, energy surcharge, pool\/towels.<br \/>\nMost hotels and resorts in the Bahamas are located in\u00a0New Providence\u00a0(Nassau) and neighboring\u00a0Paradise Island. The rest of the country remains rather off the beaten track for tourism, and places like\u00a0Eleuthera, despite being 100 miles long, has only three hotels.<br \/>\nTourism is the main industry followed by banking. 50 percent of the national GDP is generated by tourism.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SEE<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Diving:<\/strong>\u00a0The &#8220;shallow seas&#8221; of the Bahamas lie over an extensive submerged limestone platform, with high points here and there just breaking the surface to form an archipelago. The climate is good for diving year-round, and hurricanes seldom strike. All the inhabited islands have local diving, and some have extensive inland cave systems. Nassau on New Providence is the base for liveaboard cruises.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BAHAMAS NORTH<br \/>\nHistoric Lighthouses of Bahamas<\/strong> Tentative WHS:<br \/>\nGreat Isaac Cay Lighthouse.
