The tomb&#8217;s architectural decor is considered to be unique, with polychrome half-human, half-plant caryatids and painted murals. The ten female figures carved in high relief on the walls of the central chamber and the decorations of the lunette in its vault are the only examples of this type found so far in the Thracian lands. It is a remarkable reminder of the culture of the Getae, a Thracian people who were in contact with the Hellenistic and Hyperborean worlds, according to ancient geographers.<br \/>\nIn 2012, archaeologists uncovered a significant treasure near the village. The treasure included a golden ring, 44 female figure depictions and 100 golden buttons, found in 150 tombs from the 4th century BC.

It was renovated in 2004 and has modern white plaster walls and a new marble altar screen around the apse area containing the 5 graves of Bulgarian kings from the 12<sup>th<\/sup> and 13<sup>th<\/sup> centuries. The old part (the nave \u2013 the Temple of Great Monastery) has some frescoes but little to see. The roof is mostly missing and covered by a new wood roof.

Initially, there were textile and wool factories, then knitwear, leather, metal, cotton, gunpowder and iron, most of them based on a good supply of hydro-generated electricity. With communism, all the industries were nationalized and many merged resulting in an initial loss of jobs. Metal machining, loom manufacture, cranes, chemical and plastic factories, cutlery and military industries (including land mines) were developed.

Prince Ferdinand bought the property, added more land, built a mansion and called it Vrana (\u201ccrow\u201d) homestead. Of the 2550 acres, 1200 was turned into a park with 4 ponds, 4 greenhouses, 4 rockeries and created his own brand of ecological agriculture. He planted 821 trees and shrubs from 178 plant families. After 1946, Prime Minister Demetrov settled in the park in a small log cabin.<br \/>\nThe park and mansion are open to the public every Saturday and Sunday from 9-4. I returned on Saturday morning, walked past a lily pond with a log cabin, two rockeries, the palace (a lovely 2-story mansion that appears to never be open to the public), the greenhouses and completed the circuit back at the parking area. It is an extremely serene area for a walk. 5 BGN<\/p>\n<p><strong>Snail House.<\/strong> In the NM \u201c<em>Bizzarium\u201d series, this odd structure is in SW Sofia. It is a large building of blue, green, red, white and orange sheet metal plates riveted together. The front door frame, nose and eyebrows are concrete.

There are two large garage doors on the front, several snail planters and a yellow sidewalk surrounding it.<br \/>\n<\/em><strong>Boyana Church <\/strong>(Kaloyon\u2019s Church). A World Heritage Site (1979), this small church is renowned for its medieval mural paintings \u2013 noted for their accurate depictions and rich colour palette.<br \/>\nFrom the outside, the three stages are obvious. The original is all brick and the addition is brick\/stone\/wood layering.<br \/>\nThe original church was built in the 2<sup>nd<\/sup> half of the 12<sup>th<\/sup> century\/early part of the 13<sup>th<\/sup> century and called St Nikola. In 1259, Sebastacutor Kaloyon built a narthex second floor and dome over the original, called that section St Pantelemon Church and totally repainted the interior. In 1845, an external narthex was added.<br \/>\nOf the frescoes, only parts in the nave and narthex are well preserved, the best are the portraits of Kaloyon and his wife. Buried here are Patriarch Kiril and Exarch Stefan who prevented exporting Jews to Nazi concentration camps in WWII.<br \/>\nYou need a reservation to visit as the tiny church only accommodates 8 visitors at once. 10 GBN, 12 GBN combined ticket with National History Museum.\u00a0\u00a0 <em><br \/>\n<\/em><strong>National History Museum.<\/strong> This is an archaeological, ethnographic, and history museum with exhibits not ordered by date.

The grizzly bear didn\u2019t look like the grizzlies I have seen in the wild but was a very active animal. I hate seeing wolves pace their small enclosure. The Siberian tiger was a magnificent animal who came over to the glass to look at me and then sprayed.

In north Sofia, this modern station has a large waiting area and is nicely arranged to buy tickets and access the platforms. There are two nice large mosaics on the walls.<br \/>\n<strong>Monument to the Soviet Army.<\/strong> In a large park, this is a wonderful sentimental monument full of the warm feelings between Bulgaria and the Soviet military. Two small monuments show Bulgarian citizens thanking Soviet soldiers. The large monument is a stone column with a soldier and his arms around a family. On three sides of the base are great bas-reliefs of war scenes and a third with a politician and general. A few years ago, two of these bas-reliefs were painted in garish colours. The paint has since been removed but traces are still visible. Free<br \/>\n<strong>Red House<\/strong>.

In the centre of the bottom floor are at least 100 giant crystals from Brazil collected by a Bulgarian, the heaviest weighing over 1,400kgs. Very few minerals form crystals: quartz, calcite, gypsum, beryl, tourmaline, feldspar, and mica. Amethyst geodes always amaze me. Surrounding these huge crystals are glass cases on two floors with thousands of good rocks and minerals, all labeled in English but few explanations of the method of formation or the locations.

Borovets is 10\u00a0km from Samokov, 73\u00a0km from Sofia and 125\u00a0km from Plovdiv.<br \/>\nBorovets is the oldest Bulgarian winter resort with a history that dates back to 1896. Borovets was originally established at the end of the 19th Century as a hunting place for the Bulgarian Kings. Borovets gradually developed into a modern ski resort with hotels, restaurants, bars and a network of ski runs and lifts along the slopes of the Rila Mountains, providing for a whole range of winter sports. The resort has twice hosted World Cup Alpine Skiing rounds(1981 and 1984), while the Biathlon track is one of the best in the world.<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>The Super Borovets project is one of the largest and most expensive investment and development projects in Bulgarian history. The plan is to enlarge Borovets town to encompass the nearby towns of Samokov and Beli Iskar.<br \/>\nThe ski resort is at an altitude of 1350 m. 58 km of marked pistes cover the generally north-facing slopes up to an altitude of 2560 m, with many runs terminating near the village centre allowing skiers to ski almost to their hotel door. The longest run is a gentle 12 km return to the resort along the maintenance road.<br \/>\nDuring the summer, there are mountain and forest tracks and more recently, mountain biking has many dedicated routes which include purpose-made jumps. The lifts are working in the summer and bikers can take their bikes up on them. Different lifts work on different days. Hiking is also popular as is fishing at the local trout fishery.<br \/>\nKings Palace (Tsarska Bistritsa) is open from 10 till 5 Friday to Sunday and cost 3 leva entry.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tsary Mali Grad Funicular<\/strong>, Belchin, About 30kms NW of Borovets, the funicular (4 BGN, 2 reduced) takes you to the top of St Spa\u2019s Hill.
