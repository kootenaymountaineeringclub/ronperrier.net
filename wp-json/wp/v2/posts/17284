The climate of Egypt is very suitable for astronomical photography during the greater part of the year: at times the atmosphere is so clear that stars are seen to set suddenly behind the desert horizon.<br \/>\nIt was the first large telescope in Africa. It was used for photographing nebulae, for classification of spiral galaxies, recording nebulae spectra, observing Halley\u2019s comet (1909\/10) and especially for the variable nebula NGC 6729 in Coronae Australis.<br \/>\nComets like Neujmin, Grigg-Skjellerup, Forbes, Tempel\u2019s, Peltier Whipple, Kaho, Peltier, Jackson, Brook\u2019s, Wolf\u2019s, Borrelly\u2019s, Quenisset\u2019s, Beljawsky\u2019s and Mellish were regularly observed. <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">After the launch of the first satellite in 1957, telescopes and stations have been installed at Helwan Observatory for tracking artificial satellites.

The Bent Pyramid was the first attempt at building a smooth sided pyramid, but proved to be an unsuccessful build due to the miscalculations made on the structural weight that was being placed onto the soft ground (sand, gravel, and clay), which had a tendency to subside.

The Red Pyramid\u2019s name reigns from the material that was used to construct the pyramid, red limestone. This pyramid is believed to be the resting place of King Sneferu.<br \/>\nThe White Pyramid is that of the 12th Dynasty King Amenemhat II (1929\u20131895 BC).

Dionysia was the start of the caravan route to the Bahariya oasis. There are the remains of Roman baths and villas.<br \/>\nThe biggest attraction is the temple dedicated to the syncretic god Sobek-Ra with the features of the crocodile god Sobek and the solar deity, Ra. The building was built using large blocks of yellow limestone and is the only building that is almost completely preserved. Devoid of decorations, it looks from the outside like an uninteresting, square box. Inside, however, there is a real labyrinth of chambers, staircases, corridors, and tunnels arranged on different levels. There is a great view from the roof, as the yellow sands of the desert and the stony remains of the old city stretch to the horizon.<br \/>\nOn December 21 each year, the sun illuminates the sanctuary Quds el-Aqdas (Holy Saints) inside the Qasr Qarun temple. This is called the sun alignment phenomenon.<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"main-photo\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\" src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/725\/31874510516_cc7a66798e_h.jpg\" alt=\"Qarun Palace (Qasr qarun), Faiyum Qsis, Egypt | by CamelKW\" width=\"639\" height=\"479\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>I didn&#8217;t see the following:<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Pyramid of Senusret II.

O<\/span>n the northern side of Birkat Qarun, it was a Ptolemaic city believed to be founded by Ptolemy II in the third century BC, on a site that shows evidence of habitation from the Neolithic period. Today, it is more isolated, but during Ptolemaic times it was at the shore of the much larger lake, situated at the edge of Moeris Bay, and the beginning of the caravan routes into the Western Desert.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/www.touregypt.net\/images\/touregypt\/dimeh1.jpg\" alt=\"A view of the temple area at Dimeh\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It was Ptolemy who reduced the size of the lake to provide land for the settlement of retired Macedonian soldiers and their families. The town served as a port and today, the site is 65 meters higher and 2.5 kilometers beyond the water&#8217;s edge.<br \/>\nDuring the troubles of the Roman Period, Dimeh reached its zenith and its ultimate decline. It was on the fringe of the desert away from the cultivated lands on the south side of the lake, so it was rather of a frontier outpost. Retired Roman soldiers preferred to live in the villages to the south like Philadelpha and Karanis.<br \/>\nGoods from the Fayoum were transported across the lake by boat to be unloaded at the docks of Dimeh, stored, or carried up the Avenue of the Lions, assessed for a customs fee, and reloaded on animals for desert caravans. These caravans moved north over Gebel Qatrani and probably via\u00a0Wadi Natrun\u00a0to the Mediterranean and on to Rome.<br \/>\nHere at Soknopiaou Nesos, as in other desert outposts in the Western and Eastern deserts, and along the northern coast, security systems were in place to protect caravans, but they did not always succeed. Dimeh was inhabited for six centuries and was finally abandoned by the middle of the third century AD.<br \/>\nThe ruins of Dimeh al-Siba contain two temples, houses, underground chambers, streets, and ten-meter-high walls that are sometimes up to five meters thick. The walls themselves are a testament to the survivability of mudbrick in the desert environment. The ground is strewn with debris. An uncountable number of shards cover the entire temple mound. They are all over the place.<br \/>\nThe city itself was spread out over a great distance through the desert, and the mudbrick walls that are still standing did not contain the entire town, but only the temple area. To the north were the agricultural fields, separated by long irrigation canals. To the south was the Gate of Soknopaios, at the end of the Avenue of the Lions, which ran down to the edge of the lake where the docks were located. Today, one can still see the remains of this road, which ends about a kilometer to the south of the ruins at a quay. The quay has two limestone piers and steps leading south, presumably to the water&#8217;s edge.<br \/>\n<strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><em>The following are significantly south of Fayoum:<\/em><\/span><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><br \/>\nSpeos Artemidos <\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">(Temple of Pakht) <\/span>is an archaeological site\u00a0located about 2\u00a0km south of the\u00a0Middle Kingdom\u00a0tombs at\u00a0Beni Hasan, and about 28\u00a0km south of\u00a0Al Minya.

They are cut out of the rock into the cliffs on the eastern side of the Nile. Cut from the living rock, Hatshepsut&#8217;s temple is composed of two chambers connected by a short passageway. Unfortunately, only three of the four columns forming the facade are still relatively intact and none of the internal pillars remain.

Because the pyramid-building age was over or maybe because they could not afford to construct their own pyramids, they chose the limestone cliffs of the eastern desert overlooking a gentle curve in the Nile as an ideal spot on which to carve their tombs. These chapel-tombs at Beni Hasan are the only remnant of the era.

One of the country\u2019s main tourist centres located on the Red Sea coast owing to its dramatic landscape, year-round dry and temperate climate and long stretches of natural beaches. Its waters are clear and calm for most of the year. Founded in 1905, it was a small fishing village, but it has grown into a major Red Sea holiday destination for Europeans starting in the 1980s. The city is known for its watersports (windsurfing, kitesurfing, yachting, scuba diving, and snorkeling), nightlife and warm weather. Daytime temperatures are around 30 \u00b0C most of the year (July and August over 40 \u00b0C). Tourist numbers from Russia dropped significantly after the Metrojet Flight 9268 plane crash in November 2015.<br \/>\nThe city extends for about 36 kilometres (22\u00a0mi) along the coast, but does not reach far into the surrounding desert. Dive sites around Abu Ramada Island,\u00a0Fanadir,\u00a0Giftun Kebir, and\u00a0Giftun Soraya\u00a0are popular. Tourists also visit shipwrecks such as the El Mina or the Rosalie Moller.

The last rainfall was seen in September 1998 and as much as 10 to 15 years may pass without a drop. Yet this little rain is sufficient to allow vegetation and some wildlife to survive.<br \/>\nThe western part lies entirely in Libya and forms a large granite ring complex about 25 km in diameter, being the eroded remnants of a large archaic granite dome. Two permanent springs, Ain Ghazal and Ain Doua, can be found at the southern foot and have never gone dry in living memory. A heavily used desert track passes by along the western rim of the Mountain, linking Kufra with El-Fasher in western Sudan. Site<br \/>\n<em><strong>The Gilf El-Kebir Plateau<\/strong><\/em>. A landscape similar to Mars and one of the driest regions of the Earth. Remote and not yet been fully explored. It is a high, flat-topped plateau (a few basalt flows) of Nubia sandstone covered with a thick red soil with vertical escarpments on all sides, 200 to 300 m above the surrounding desert. It is dissected by numerous canyon-like dry wadis. The soil indicates heavy rainfall in older times.<\/p>\n<p><strong>OTHER DESTINATIONS<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Bir Tawil.<\/strong>\u00a0M@P<br \/>\n<strong>Hala\u2019ib Triangle.<\/strong>\u00a0Egypt\/Sudan \u2013\u00a0M@P, XL<br \/>\n<strong>El Ikhwa island<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Shadwan Island<em><br \/>\n<\/em>Foul Bay area<\/strong>,\u00a0XL<\/p>\n<p><strong>Wadi el Gemal NP<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Brothers Islands Lighthouse<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Egypt Central &amp; Red Sea Dec 11-14Observations on Egypt 1.
