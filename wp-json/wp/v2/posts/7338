This party climbed Cascade on return.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">My last 1995 trip to Poplar Creek was a club outing on September 8-9.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Mt. Marion is a glaciated peak about 2.5 km. S. of Cascade Mtn. at the apex of the headwaters of Wilson, Cascade, and McKian Creeks. It provides the most mountaineering interest of any of the peaks I&#8217;ve climbed out of Poplar Creek. Seven souls signed up for this outing: Hamish Mutch, Peter Tchir, Peter Jordan, Robin Lidstone, Kim Kratky, Ted Ibrahim, and Paul Allen.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">After a Friday-night car camp at km. 10 on the main Poplar Creek road, we were up at 5:00 to drive to km. 17 where the S. fork road turns off. We followed this S. fork to its end (see my article in Karabiner vol. 37, pp. 23-24 for further details) and parked where the road gets quite bad and switches back left. We didn&#8217;t find a really good route through the timber until our return, so I&#8217;ll give the details of the best approach to the alpine.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Walk up this left switchback to another landing. From there, follow a skid road up and to the right. This soon levels out and becomes overgrown, but still features a path in the middle. Upon reaching the end of this skid road (about 10 min. from the car), look above the road to pick out some flagging. This marks the beginning of a very good trail that diagonals upward through open timber and into the basin on the NW side of Cascade (30 min. from car). The trail continues S. through more-or-less open country (where it&#8217;s faint, there is flagging), passing E. and S. of the lake at 801-715 to reach the col at 803-708 (perhaps an hour from the car).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">From this point we traversed E. and S. through alpland on the SW side of Cascade, passing through a col at 816-695. We then continued E. toward the Cascade-Marion col. There is a variety of routes through open country; if one gets too far N. below the bulk of Cascade, there are rock bands and steep heather that have to be descended. Farther toward the head of the valley of Wilson Creek, we found several limestone sinkholes big enough to climb into to a depth of 10&#8242;-12&#8242;.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Before reaching the Cascade-Marion col, we started up snow and scree on the NW side of the prominent N. ridge (833-680 to 698) that leads to an unnamed subpeak to the W. of Marion. Gaining the ridge, most of us diagonaled down several hundred feet to reach the glacier at about 834-694. This unpleasant section featured steep dirt mixed with rotten rock, spiced by cliffs below. Impossible to protect. We gained the glacier, roped up, and traversed SE between bare ice sections to a rock buttress that is the true N. ridge of Marion itself. Hamish, Peter Tchir, and I cramponed up several hundred feet of ice and snow-over-ice parallel to, and on the E. side of, the ridge. Robin Lidstone and Ted Ibrahim, who were without crampons, started on the rock ridge itself. Higher up, we three joined the others and scrambled to the summit. At first, the angle was quite gentle; farther up, the rock was loose; and higher still, the ridge was characterized by slabs covered with gravel (unpleasant, but only moderately dangerous). We reached the summit at 12:45 (5 hrs. 45 min. up), the rope being used only for glacier travel. Just as Peter T. and I reached the top, we met Paul Allen and Peter Jordan, who were coming up the W. ridge. They had ascended the N. ridge of the subpeak for several hundred feet above our party and crossed the glacier higher up. They then climbed an iced-up couloir to reach the ridge between Marion and its western subpeak and continued to the summit by an easy scramble. Finding a cairn with no record, we added notes about our outing and included a brief reference to the 1961 first ascent, a 5 1\/2-day epic from Meadow Mtn.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">For the descent, the parties again separated in the same way, although Paul insisted his route was much easier. Those without crampons chose not to accompany him and Peter J. (probably a wise choice), and the three of us with crampons gave no thought of separating from our less stylishly equipped colleagues. As descending the gravelly N. ridge was tedious, Hamish (who was way ahead) decided to find an exit route off the ridge to the glacier below and the E. of the ridge. Following him, we descended 100&#8242; of an ugly scree couloir to reach some steep snow on the glacier. Soon we were back at the point where we had joined the ridge on the way up. Here, we separated as before, reconvening to rope up for the glacier traverse. The only untoward event occurred on this traverse when Ted plunged without warning into a crevasse to a depth of about 14&#8242;. It took about 25 min. for him to get out with the aid of prusiks and some etriers we sent down to him. His mishap was a result of inexperience, as he stepped right on a patch of bright white snow surrounded by dirty, grey ice that we had studiously ignored on the way over.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Anyway, we retraced our steps and made a rendezvous with Paul and Peter J. for the long plod to the trucks as per our ascent route.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">We arrived back at 6:35 pm. That&#8217;s a 5 hr. 25 min. return, and an 11.5-hour day. Paul&#8217;s route is faster, but our party seemed satisfied with the N. ridge, which was probably the first ascent by a new, if not particularly significant, route. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\"><strong>MARION<\/strong> (9,730&#8242;) N. ridge (III,4,s\/i\/g) Kim Kratky, Ted Ibrahim, Robin Lidstone, Hamish Mutch, Peter Tchir, September 9, 1995.
