I completed my Ph.D. in Animal Science at the University of Illinois in Urbana and am now an Assistant Professor of Animal Science at Colorado State University.\u201d Few people had seen a mature woman who called herself autistic. This conference effectively launched Grandin\u2019s career as a public speaker. Two decades later, the scene was created for the Emmy-winning biopic <em>Temple Grandin<\/em>, starring Claire Danes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Recounting the story of her life in her inimitably gruff and blunt-spoken way, Grandin cast more light on the day-to-day reality of autism than decades of clinical observation and speculation had managed to produce. She could not speak until age three but was fortunate to get early speech therapy.\u00a0 Her teachers also taught her how to wait and take turns when playing board games.\u00a0 She was mainstreamed into a regular kindergarten at age five but struggled with severe behavioural issues through her teens as she was considered weird and teased and bullied in high school.\u00a0 The only places she had friends were activities with a shared interest, such as horses, electronics, or model rockets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>She had managed to avoid institutionalization only because the neurologist who initially examined her diagnosed her with brain damage rather than autism.<\/p>\n<p>When she was young, Mr. Carlock, her science teacher, was an important mentor who encouraged her interest in science.\u00a0 She had a reason for studying when she had a new goal of becoming a scientist. She believes labels like high-functioning and low-functioning were too simplistic.\u00a0\u00a0Today, half the cattle in the United States are handled in facilities she has designed.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Grandin characterized descriptions of nonverbal children as willfully oblivious to the people around them as terribly misguided. \u201cIf adults spoke directly to me, I could understand everything they said, but not get my words out.\u201d My mother and teachers wondered why I screamed. Screaming was the only way I could communicate.\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br \/>\nShe pointed out the inadequacy of existing empirical methods for capturing the sensory sensitivities at the core of the autistic experience. There was nothing unusual with her hearing. She described being bombarded with certain sounds as \u201chaving a hearing aid stuck on, \u201csuper loud.&#8221; She misbehaved in church so often as a little girl because the unfamiliar petticoats, skirts, and stockings she was forced to wear on Sundays felt scratchy against her skin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">She pointedly referred to her autism as a \u201chandicap\u201d rather than a mental illness, invoking the humanizing language of disability over the stigmatizing lexicon of psychiatry.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">She described how the visual nature of her thought processes and memory gave her practical career advantages. \u201cIf someone says the word cat, my images are of individualized cats I have known or read about. I do not think of a generalized cat. My career as a designer of livestock facilities maximizes my talent areas and minimizes my deficits. . . . Visual thinking is an asset for an equipment designer. I can \u2018see\u2019 how all the parts of a project fit together and see potential problems.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Then she traced the roots of her creative gifts through the branches of her family tree, describing her paternal great-grandfather as a maverick who launched the biggest corporate wheat farm in the world and her maternal grandfather as a shy engineer who helped invent the automatic airplane pilot. All three of her siblings think visually, and one of her sisters, a gifted interior designer, has dyslexia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Her emphasis on the virtues of atypical minds marked a significant departure from the view of most psychologists, who framed the areas of strength in their patients\u2019 cognitive profiles as mere \u201csplinter skills\u201d \u2013 islands of conserved ability in seas of general incompetence. Instead, Grandin proposed that people with autism, dyslexia, and other cognitive differences could make contributions to society that so-called normal people are incapable of making.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Grandin pays tribute to her mentors, starting with her mother, Eustacia Cutler, who never lost faith in her potential and fought many battles to ensure that Temple got an education. William Carlock was the high school science teacher who channelled her teenage fascination with cows into a career in animal science. The turning point in her life occurred one summer at her Aunt Ann\u2019s ranch when she noticed that fearful calves calmed down when herded into a device called a squeeze chute that held them securely in place. When it also alleviated her \u201cnerve attacks\u201d, she devised a similar apparatus for herself. It also made her more emotionally connected to the people around her. \u201cFor the first time in my life, I felt a purpose for learning.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As one of the first adults to publicly identify as autistic, Grandin helped break down decades of shame and stigma. To most clinicians at the time, the notion of an autistic adult with a doctorate and a successful career seemed implausible at best. In 1986, she wrote her memoir, <em>Emergence,<\/em> the first book by a recovered autistic individual.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Dr. Grandin did not talk until she was three and a half years old. Oliver Sacks wrote in the forward of <em>Thinking in Pictures<\/em> that her first book<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><i>, Emergence: Labelled Autistic,<\/i><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> was \u201cunprecedented because there had never before been an inside narrative of autism.\u201d\u00a0 Dr. Oliver Sacks profiled Dr. Grandin in his best-selling book An\u00a0<\/span><em style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Anthropologist on Mars<\/em><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">.<\/span><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br \/>\nIt soon became apparent to her that she had not recovered but had learned, with great effort, to adapt to the social norms of the people around her. \u201cWhen I said that early stuff, I didn\u2019t realize how different my thinking was. I was doing a lot of construction projects in the early &#8217;90s, and I could draw something and test run that piece of equipment in my mind. I could draw the layout for a meat-cutting line and make the conveyors move.\u201d She began to think of herself as having a robust digital workstation in her head, capable of running instantaneous searches through a massive library of stored images and generating 3-D videos from the sketches on her drafting table.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">She noticed how many parents at autistic conferences were gifted in technical fields. \u201cI started to think of autistic traits as being on a continuum. The more traits you had on both sides, the more you concentrated the genetics. Having a little bit of the traits gave you an advantage, but if you had too much, you ended up with very severe autism.\u201d She warned that efforts to eradicate autism from the gene pool could put humankind\u2019s future at risk by purging the same qualities that had advanced culture, science, and technological innovation for millennia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Adults with autism and their parents are often angry about autism. Why would nature or God create such horrible conditions? However, if the genes that caused these conditions were eliminated, there might be a terrible price to pay. People with bits of these traits are more creative, or possibly even geniuses. If science eliminated these genes, maybe the whole world would be taken over by accountants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Dr. Grandin became a prominent author and speaker on autism and animal behaviour.\u00a0 Today, she is a professor of Animal Science at Colorado State University.\u00a0 She also has a successful career consulting on livestock handling equipment design and animal welfare.\u00a0 She has been featured on NPR (National Public Radio) and a BBC Special \u2013&#8221;The Woman Who Thinks Like a Cow&#8221;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">.<\/span> She has also appeared on National TV shows such as\u00a0<span class=\"show\">Larry King Live<\/span>,\u00a0<span class=\"show\">20\/20, Sixty Minutes<\/span>,\u00a0<span class=\"show\">Fox, and Friends and<\/span>\u00a0has a\u00a0<span class=\"show\">2010 TED talk<\/span>. Articles about Dr. Grandin have appeared in\u00a0<span class=\"show\">Time Magazine<\/span>, the <span class=\"show\">New York Times<\/span>,\u00a0<span class=\"show\">Discover Magazine<\/span>,\u00a0<span class=\"show\">Forbes,<\/span>\u00a0and\u00a0<span class=\"show\">USA Today<\/span>. HBO made an Emmy Award-winning movie about her life, and she was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2016.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association revised the diagnostic criteria for autism.\u00a0 This significantly broadened the spectrum.\u00a0 It now ranges from brilliant scientists, artists, and musicians to individuals who cannot dress themselves.\u00a0 Over the years, the diagnostic criteria have kept changing.\u00a0 It is not as precise as a lab test for strep throat.\u00a0 Labels such as autism, ADHD, sensory processing disorder, or learning disability are often applied to the same child.\u00a0 In older children with no speech delay, the diagnosis sometimes switches back and forth between autism and ADHD.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cOne of the problems today is that for a kid to get any special services in school, they must have a label.\u00a0 The problem with autism is you\u2019ve got a spectrum that ranges from Einstein to someone with no language and intellectual disability,\u201d said Grandin.\u00a0 \u201cSteve Jobs was probably mildly on the autism spectrum.\u00a0 You\u2019ve probably known people who were geeky and socially awkward but very smart.\u00a0 When do geeks and nerds become autistic? That\u2019s a gray area.\u00a0 Half the people in Silicon Valley probably have autism.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As the number of children diagnosed with autism continues to rise nationally, Grandin is sharing her message about the disorder and \u201cdifferently abled brains\u201d with packed houses. This is at the heart of that message: &#8220;Rigid academic and social expectations could wind up stifling a mind that, while it might struggle to conjugate a verb, could one day take us to distant stars.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cParents get so worried about the deficits that they don&#8217;t build up the strengths, but those skills could turn into a job,\u201d said Grandin, who addresses scientific advances in understanding autism in her newest book, \u201c<em>The Autistic Brain: Thinking Across the Spectrum.\u201d<\/em> These kids often have uneven skills.\u00a0 We need to be a lot more flexible about things. Don\u2019t hold these math geniuses back. You\u2019ll have to give them special ed in reading because that tends to be the pattern, but let them go ahead in math.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Early diagnosis can lead to early intervention and access to special education programs. While crucial for children with speech delay, it also means a permanent label that ultimately could impede progress and the healthy development of a child\u2019s identity. There are other situations where an autism diagnosis is helpful for an older person who is having problems with relationships. It can give them great insight and enable them to improve relationships.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A label can also impact parental expectations, a significant source of therapeutic momentum for children.\u00a0 A parent with a diagnosed autistic child might be reluctant to teach practical social skills that are outside the child\u2019s comfort zone, such as ordering food at a lunch counter. You must stretch these kids outside their comfort zone to help them develop.\u00a0 Give them choices of \u201cstretching\u201d activities, such as Boy Scouts or robotics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cIt hurts because they don\u2019t have enough expectations for the kids.\u00a0 I see too many smart kids who did well in school, but they\u2019re not getting a job because they didn\u2019t learn any work skills when they were young,\u201d Grandin said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got no life skills.\u00a0 The parents think, \u2018Oh, poor Tommy. He has autism, so he doesn\u2019t have to learn things like shopping.\u201d Grandin was raised by her mother in the 1950s, a time when social skills were \u201cpounded into every single child,\u201d she said. \u201cChildren in my generation, when they were teenagers, had jobs and learned how to work.\u00a0 I cleaned horse stalls.\u00a0 When I was 8 years old, my mother made me be a party hostess \u2013 shake hands, take coats, etc. In the 1950s, social skills were taught in a much more rigid way, so kids who were mildly autistic were forced to learn them. It hurts the autistic much more than it does the normal kids not to have these skills formally taught.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cIn my generation, paper routes taught important working skills.\u00a0 Today, parents should set up jobs a child can do in the neighbourhood, such as walking dogs for the neighbours.\u00a0 Younger children can do volunteer jobs outside the home, such as being an usher at a house of worship or a community center.\u00a0 This will teach both discipline and responsibility.\u00a0 It improved my self-esteem to be recognized for doing a job well.\u201d \u201cThe skills that people with autism bring to the table should be nurtured for their benefit and society\u2019s,\u201d Grandin said. \u201c<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">And, if a cure for autism were found, she would choose to stay just the way she is. \u201cI like the logical way that I think.\u00a0 I\u2019m logical. It blows my mind how irrational human beings are,\u201d She said. \u201cIf you get rid of autism, you\u2019d have nobody to fix your computer in the future.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">If algebra had been a required course for college graduation in 1967, there would be no Temple Grandin. At least, no Temple Grandin as the world knows her today \u2013 professor, inventor, best-selling author, and rock star in the seemingly divergent fields of animal science and autism education.\u00a0 \u201cI probably would have been a handyman, fixing toilets at some apartment building somewhere,\u201d said Grandin. \u201cI can\u2019t do algebra.\u00a0 It makes no sense. Why does algebra have to be the gateway to all other mathematics?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The abstract concepts in algebra present a standard stumbling block for many with an autism spectrum disorder, dyslexia, or other learning problems.\u00a0 Many of the kids would do well if geometry were substituted for algebra. For autistic and photo-realistic visual thinkers, such as Grandin, understanding comes from seeing and working through a concept in images, creating what is, in effect, a virtual reality program that plays out in the brain.\u00a0 In this manner, Grandin, who didn\u2019t speak until she was almost 4, conceptualized down to minute details her design for a humane livestock restraint system now used on nearly half of the cattle in the U.S.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Fortunately, the academic trend in the late 1960s was finite math, a course Grandin passed with the help of tutors and devoted study, satisfying her college math requirement.\u00a0 She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology and master&#8217;s and doctoral degrees in animal science.\u00a0 For the past two decades, she\u2019s been a professor at Colorado State University.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In her book, <em>The Autistic Brain<\/em>, she presents research findings that show three specialized thinking types.\u00a0 <em>They are the photorealistic visual thinkers who think the way I do, math\/pattern thinkers, and word thinkers. Children who think differently will often thrive if they have more hands-on activities.\u00a0 Parents must work with the schools to ensure that elementary school children have art, music, theatre, sewing, woodworking, computer programs, and cooking.\u00a0 These classes teach essential career skills and provide opportunities for students to interact socially with their peers.\u00a0 Older students need access to career-related courses such as welding, auto mechanics, and computer science.<\/em><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>There is a massive shortage of skilled mechanics. When I installed my systems in construction, I worked with many talented mechanics and metal fabricators.\u00a0 Some of them may have been on the milder end of the autism spectrum.\u00a0 These people were brilliant, and they built very complicated things.\u00a0 Skilled trades are not for everybody on the spectrum.\u00a0 I estimate that a professional trade would be a good choice for 25% of entirely verbal people with ASD.\u00a0 When I look back on my long career, some of the best days of my life were out at a construction site.\u00a0 It was so much fun to talk about building things.<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">&#8211; 1 in 59 U.S. children has been identified with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">&#8211; ASD is 4.5 times more common in boys (1 in 42) and girls (1 in 189).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">&#8211; About 1 in 6 children in the U.S. had a developmental disability from 2006 to 2008.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Oliver Sacks visited Grandin at Colorado State University. His views of autism were swiftly evolving, informed by the insights of Lorna Wing, Uta Frith, and the others in the London group. He suspected that in writing <em>Emergence<\/em>, Grandin\u2019s co-author, Margaret Scariano, must have ghostwritten it. \u201cThe autistic mind, it was supposed at the time, was incapable of self-understanding and understanding others and therefore of introspection and retrospection. How could an autistic person write an autobiography? It seemed a contradiction.\u201d After reading dozens of her papers, he found that Grandin\u2019s distinctive persona \u2013 that of an irrepressibly curious observer of society from the outside, an \u201canthropologist on Mars,\u201d as she put it \u2013 was consistent throughout. She was writing in her voice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">He eventually realized that autistic people were capable of \u201cgetting\u201d humour. Autism must be seen as a whole way of being, a profoundly different mode of identity, one that needs to be conscious (and proud) of itself. In an environment designed for their comfort, they don\u2019t feel disabled; they feel different from their neighbours.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Sachs spent several days with Grandin. Grandin was amused to discover that the eminent neurologist was nearly as eccentric as she was. \u201cHe was like a kindly absentminded professor who zoned out a lot.\u201d In his next best-selling book, <em>An Anthropologist on Mars<\/em>, he wrote an in-depth profile of her that became the book&#8217;s centrepiece. After 50 years of describing autistic people as befitting robots or \u201cimbeciles\u201d, Sachs presented Grandin in the full breadth of her humanity \u2013 capable of joy, whimsy, tenderness, passion about her work, exuberance, longing, philosophical musing on her legacy, and sly subterfuge. He acknowledged the prevailing theory that autism is \u201cforemost a disorder of affect, of empathy\u201d, but also explored her deep sense of kinship with other disabled people and with animals, whose fates she saw as intertwined in a society that views them both as less than human.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The chances of Grandin\u2019s perspective taking root among autism professionals, however, were slim. The notion that an autism diagnosis was a fate worse than death proved hard to dispel \u2013 \u201ca terminal illness&#8230; a dead soul in a live body.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The diagnosis inspired the creation of a whole new set of dehumanizing stereotypes in the media. The first mention of Asperger\u2019s syndrome in the English language, in the <em>Toronto Star<\/em> in 1989, described \u201cstrange\u201d and \u201cclumsy\u201d nerds who read books compulsively without understanding them, were incapable of friendship, and burst into tears and laughter for no reason. The second mention, in the <em>Sydney Morning Herald<\/em>, led off with the sentence, \u201cIt is the plague of those unable to feel.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Even parent advocacy groups ignored autistic adults. Presentations at conferences dwelled on the usual deficits and impairments, rather than exploring the atypical gifts that Grandin found so helpful in her work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/www.templegrandin.com\/2012\/images\/jpg\/Temple%20Grandin%20Sculpture.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"669\" height=\"448\" \/><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Temple has been honoured with a sculpture housed within the JBS Global Food Innovation Center on the Colorado State University Campus.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><em><strong>Personal Life.\u00a0<\/strong><\/em><\/span>I think using animals for food is an ethical thing to do, but we&#8217;ve got to do it right.

We owe the animals respect. \u2014Temple Grandin<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Grandin says that &#8220;the part of other people that has emotional relationships is not part of me&#8221;, and she has neither married nor had children. She later stated, for example, that she preferred the science fiction, documentary, and thriller genres of films and television shows to more dramatic or romantic ones. Beyond her work in animal science, welfare, and autism rights, her interests include horseback riding, science fiction, movies, and biochemistry.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">She has noted in her autobiographical works that autism affects every aspect of her life. Grandin has to wear comfortable clothes to counteract her sensory processing disorder and has structured her lifestyle to avoid sensory overload. She regularly takes antidepressants, but no longer uses her squeeze machine, stating in February 2010: &#8220;It broke two years ago, and I never got around to fixing it. I&#8217;m into hugging people now.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>OLIVE SACKS <\/strong>(1933-2015)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">He was a neurologist who was a precise observer of the world. He met a pair of identical twins named George and Charles Finn who had been variously diagnosed as autistic, schizophrenic, and mentally retarded. \u201cGive me a date!\u201d they would cry in unison, instantly calculating the day of the week for any date in a multiple-thousand-year span. As they executed these seemingly impossible cognitions, they would focus their attention inward \u2013 their eyes darting back and forth behind thick glasses. They would enjoy conversations that consisted solely of numbers. George would utter a string of digits, and Charles would turn them over in his mind and nod; then Charles would reply similarly, and George would smile approvingly. Sachs was shocked that the twins were instantly calculating six-digit prime numbers, a feat even a computer would have found difficult to pull off at the time. Consulting a book of prime number tables, he casually dropped an eight-digit prime into the conversation. Surprised and delighted, they had no problem and raised him with even longer primes. Yet George and Charles could not perform simple multiplication, reading, or tying their shoes.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Then Sacks met Jose, a 21-year-old autistic man described as an idiot and unable to comprehend language or time. But when asked to draw a watch, he pulled every feature, not just the time. Jose was fond of the non-human world, predominantly plants, and drew flowers with feeling and great accuracy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Sacks realized that, instead of being incommunicative, his patients were communicating all the time \u2013 not in words, but in gestures and other nonverbal forms of utterance, particularly among themselves. He also objected to Lovaas&#8217;s \u201ctherapeutic punishment\u201d used in his studies at UCLA.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When Sacks made the provocative suggestion in 2001 that Henry Cavendish had Asperger&#8217;s, it was hard to remember an era when autism wasn&#8217;t a frequent topic of conversation, even among people who had no personal connection to the subject. But enormous changes had taken place in an astonishingly short period. Just fifteen years earlier, mothers of autistic children often had to gently correct neighbours who thought they&#8217;d said their son or daughter was &#8220;artistic.&#8221; The few pediatricians, psychiatrists, and teachers who read about the obscure condition in a textbook could safely assume they would get through their entire careers without diagnosing a single case.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">For decades, prevalence estimates had remained stable at just four or five per ten thousand. But that number started to snowball in the 1980s and 90s, raising the frightening possibility that a generation of children was in the grips of an epidemic of unknown origin. Books like Clara Claiborne Park\u2019s <em>The Siege<\/em>, Oliver Sacks\u2019s <em>An Anthropologist on Mars,\u00a0<\/em>and Temple Grandin\u2019s <em>Thinking in Pictures<\/em> offered a unique vantage point on the diverse world of autism.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>The Siege:<\/em>\u00a0Published in 1967, it was the first book-length account of raising an autistic child by a loving and devoted parent.

There may be a most intricate (and potentially creative) interaction between the autistic traits and other qualities of the individual. While a glance may suffice for clinical diagnosis, if we hope to understand the autistic individual, nothing less than a total biography will do.\u201d<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>Thinking in Pictures<\/em> was a biography from the inside. Encouraged by her mother and a supportive high school science teacher, she developed her instinctive kinship with animals into a practical set of skills that enabled her to succeed in designing facilities for the livestock industry.

Sacks himself shared personal information about how he got his first orgasm spontaneously while floating in a swimming pool, and later, when he was giving a man a massage. He also admits having &#8220;erotic fantasies of all sorts&#8221; in a natural history museum he visited often in his youth, many of them about animals, like hippos in the mud.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Sacks noted in a 2001 interview that severe shyness, which he described as &#8220;a disease&#8221;, had been a lifelong impediment to his interactions. He believed his shyness stemmed from his prosopagnosia, popularly known as &#8220;face-blindness&#8221;, a condition he studied in some of his patients, including the titular man from his work <i>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat<\/i>.
