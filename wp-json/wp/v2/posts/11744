It was started in a WW I munitions factory but that was outgrown and in 1937-38 a new camp was built with 37 barracks designed for 6000 prisoners. At liberation there were 32,000 and severe overcrowding. In its 12 years, about 200,000 persons from throughout Europe were imprisoned and about 40,000 died.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As the first concentration camp and the main camp within German borders, it served as the prototype where the concentration camp model was formed, developed and as a training center for the SS \u201cschool of violence\u201d who subsequently worked at other camps. That model was based on total control and terror \u2013 any minor infraction resulted in severe punishment. The initial prisoners were German political opponents. In 1938, political prisoners from annexed territories arrived plus 11,000 German and Austrian Jews; 1939 hundreds of Sinti and Roma; 1940 13,000 Polish; 1941 mass shooting of 4000 Soviet prisoners of war; 1942 2000 invalids. By 1943 there were 150 subsidiary camps most forced labour camps in the armaments industry \u2013 airplanes by Messerschmidt, BMW and Zeppelins.

The Hochablass weir was built in 1346 to guide water from the River Lech into a broad network of canals and was reconstructed several times between 1552 and 1912. The watercourses ran on the surface and so were endangered by contamination.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Water from the canals was raised using piston pump drives of reversible waterwheels via a set of levers. The boxed timber pipes that distributed water were very sensitive to pressure changes so open-compensation reservoirs were installed and these in turn necessitated the construction of towers, the precursors to later water towers. The key building of this phase was the Rotes Tor (Red Gate) that held the technical installations to pump and distribute the different water qualities into the city centre where three bronze drinking fountains designed by celebrated sculptors (Augustus, Mercury and Hercules) were installed around 1600.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In the 19<sup>th<\/sup> century industrialization process, cholera and hygiene research led to the use of deep wells and the water source and the towers were decommissioned. The neo-Renaissance Neubach waterworks was built in 1879 with horizontal pumps and four air pressure chambers to pump the water.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">This led to the early industrialization of Augsburg encouraging textile, machine and paper factories. The existing watercourses outside the historic city walls were widened to supply the growing industrial demand for water and industry developed along the Lech and Wertach rivers. Waterpower was at first used for direct mechanical drives using waterwheels and turbines, but these were later followed by hydraulic electrical power generation.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Gro\u03b2e Wasserturm (large water tower) and the Kleine Wasserturm (small water tower), the Rotes Tor as well as the Untere Brunnneturm (Lower Waterworks) are essentially the oldest water towers in Germany and probably Central Europe.

Presently 150 persons occupy 140 apartments (each with its own entrance) in 67 buildings. Today that is only for local people in need and they have to be Catholic.

It was put together using parts of several other wooden figures, the joints covered with linen and painted. It was put into the attic, then moved to a farm, the Wieshof where it became an object of veneration. During evening prayers on June 14, 1738, the Miracle of Wies took place \u2013 drops that appeared to be tears were noticed. The tiny 1740 chapel were soon too small to hold the many pilgrims from all over Europe.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The present church was built from 1746-54.

The highlight though are the marvelous painted ceilings in the main nave, chancel and over the corridor between the outer walls and columns. The chancel, pulpit and 2 large side altars are over-the-top creations of marble, gilt and statues. There are several symbolic statues \u2013 a pelican and a lamb.<br \/>\nThe capitals and all the upper walls are a wealth of stucco and gilt decoration. The windows are simple clear glass honeycomb.
