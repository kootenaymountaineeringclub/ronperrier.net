Yet by 2004 the lawless nation had more telephone connections per capita than any other east African country. Today, the Somali state is still fragile: insecurity is rife and government services are poor. But mobile data in Somalia is cheaper than in Britain, Finland or Japan\u2014and the signal is good, too. Jethro Norman, a Mancunian anthropologist who does research in Somalia, says he gets better mobile coverage in some of the remotest parts of the country than he does in Manchester.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<section class=\"css-1xs6rxu e19oi8vf1\" data-body-id=\"cp2\">\n<div class=\"css-11m2wk0 e19oi8vf2\">\n<p class=\"css-1f0x4sl e1tt35bk0\" data-component=\"paragraph\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">How has dysfunctional Somalia managed to develop such an outstanding telecoms network? The answer lies in the state\u2019s very weakness. Three decades of chaos and conflict have forced hundreds of thousands of Somalis to flee their country. Those who have stayed depend on them: the diaspora sends home around $2bn a year, roughly double the government\u2019s budget. An extensive phone network was needed to handle those vast remittance flows. In Somalia\u2019s radical free market, the invisible hand did the rest. The upside of a lack of government is that there is no need to pay for licences or to bribe corrupt officials to get the job done.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu css-0 e1cbnkh80\">\n<div>\n<div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">If telecoms flourished at first in the absence of the state, cheap internet is now helping to replace it. A recent research paper by Mr Norman<\/span><i style=\"font-size: 16px;\">\u00a0<\/i><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">shows how clan-based WhatsApp groups are increasingly being used to crowdsource capital from \u201cinvestors\u201d in the diaspora, and then to co-ordinate the building of schools, hospitals and roads with the money that is raised.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"css-1f0x4sl e1tt35bk0\" data-component=\"paragraph\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Social media is filling in for the failing state in other ways, too. WhatsApp groups serve as virtual courts, for instance, where clan elders, rather than corrupt or distant judges, resolve disputes. These online groups have revenue-raising powers; members are required to make monthly contributions, which are then used to offer payments if someone is short of money, or as a kind of health insurance to pay if they or a family member are ill. Those who do not pay are blocked from the groups.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"css-1f0x4sl e1tt35bk0\" data-component=\"paragraph\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The rise of this WhatsAppocracy is not without its flaws. Hate speech that deepens clan conflict is common, particularly among the diaspora. And WhatsApp groups can raise money to buy guns as well as schools. Still, for now, governance via WhatsApp seems to beat rule by warlords. Somalis are making do with what they have.<span class=\"ufinish\">\u25a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/article>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h1 class=\"css-1bo5zl0 eoacr0f0\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Somalia\u2019s new president vows to beat back jihadists, then talk to them<\/span><\/strong><\/h1>\n<h2 class=\"css-4vhs4z ecgqxun0\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">An interview with Hassan Sheikh Mohamud<\/span><\/h2>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"css-mticar eprz4kh0\">\n<section class=\"css-q176th e1t1xuzr0\">\n<figure class=\"css-12eysrk e3y6nua0\">\n<div>\n<div><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/1424\/801\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20220604_MAP004.jpg\" sizes=\"(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/360\/202\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20220604_MAP004.jpg 360w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/384\/216\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20220604_MAP004.jpg 384w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/480\/270\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20220604_MAP004.jpg 480w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/600\/337\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20220604_MAP004.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/834\/469\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20220604_MAP004.jpg 834w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/960\/540\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20220604_MAP004.jpg 960w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/1096\/616\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20220604_MAP004.jpg 1096w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/1280\/720\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20220604_MAP004.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/1424\/801\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20220604_MAP004.jpg 1424w\" alt=\"DOLLOW, JUBALAND, SOMALIA - 2022\/04\/14: A tuktuk with a Somali flag drives during a sandstorm in Dollow, Jubaland, southwest Somalia.

Though the central government had recently wrested control of most of Mogadishu, the capital, and had recaptured some strategic towns here and there, vast swathes of the country\u2019s centre and south remained in the hands of al-Shabab, a jihadist group with links to al-Qaeda.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Terrorist attacks were routine: just two days after his election, Mr Mohamud narrowly survived an assassination attempt. After two decades of anarchy and civil war, Somalia then looked less like a country than a gaggle of warring fiefs. \u201cWe started from scratch,\u201d says Mr Mohamud of his first term as president.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Today he finds himself in a similar position. On June 9th he will be sworn in as president again, the first time since independence in 1960 that a Somali has held the office twice. But since he handed over the reins in 2017 to Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, better known as Farmaajo, the country has slid backwards. Last year a crisis sparked by Farmaajo\u2019s attempt to stay in office by delaying elections threatened a return to full-scale civil war. Though the outgoing president eventually handed over power peacefully, he left behind a country more divided, more diplomatically isolated and less secure than it has been for years. Many Somalis and their country\u2019s foreign allies have welcomed the return of the seasoned Mr Mohamud as the man to fix the violent mess. Can he do so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Speaking to\u00a0<i>The Economist<\/i>\u00a0in a heavily fortified hotel in Mogadishu, he says it was the sight of his successor ripping up the fragile gains of the previous decade that prompted him to run for office again. The populist Farmaajo sidelined the leaders of Puntland and Jubaland, two powerful regional states, and wangled loyalists into running the other three. He lashed out at critics and packed his cronies into the federal security forces, which then threatened to disintegrate violently along clan lines. Whoever has run Somalia, a labyrinth of clan loyalties has long prevented the emergence of a true sense of national unity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Farmaajo upset foreign allies, too. He drew closer to Qatar and Turkey at the expense of other influential states in the Gulf. He picked fights with neighbouring Kenya and Djibouti. His cosying up to Eritrea and its vicious dictator, Issaias Afwerki, was particularly unpopular.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">By contrast the avuncular Mr Mohamud, an academic and civil-rights campaigner, has a more conciliatory flavour. He has moved fast to mend bridges with opponents at home and abroad. Said Deni, president of Puntland, the oldest and strongest of the five federal states (excluding the breakaway would-be country of Somaliland), notes that one of Mr Mohamud\u2019s first moves after winning the election was to invite all Somalia\u2019s regional leaders to a meal together. He promised them he would share power and complete a new federal constitution. \u201cIt was a good speech,\u201d concedes Mr Deni grudgingly (the two ran against each other in the election).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Foreign leaders have also rushed to support the new man. Kenya\u2019s president is to attend the inauguration\u2014a sign that diplomatic relations, so prickly under Farmaajo that they were severed entirely for several months, may be on the mend. \u201cWe cannot afford any outside enemies,\u201d Mr Mohamud explains. Meanwhile America, which in February took the unusual step of banning visas for Somali officials who disrupted the electoral process, says it will send hundreds of troops back into Somalia to help the government fight al-Shabab. \u201c[Mr Mohamud] is somebody we can work with,\u201d says an American official.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"article__body-text-image\">\n<figure>\n<div data-slim=\"1\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/608\/890\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20220604_MAM937.png\" sizes=\"300px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/200\/293\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20220604_MAM937.png 200w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/300\/439\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20220604_MAM937.png 300w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/400\/586\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20220604_MAM937.png 400w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/600\/878\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20220604_MAM937.png 600w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/640\/937\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20220604_MAM937.png 640w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/800\/1171\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20220604_MAM937.png 800w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/1000\/1464\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20220604_MAM937.png 1000w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/1280\/1874\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20220604_MAM937.png 1280w\" alt=\"\" \/><\/span><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But he can expect a rough ride. Al-Shabab, which was knocked back in his first term, is resurgent and still controls much of the countryside (see map). \u201cMost of the districts we liberated have been lost again,\u201d he laments. Though al-Shabab rejected the election, it may well have hoped that Farmaajo would win. On his watch it was widely believed that the jihadists had infiltrated state institutions, especially the security apparatus. \u201cThe previous government had no plan to fight al-Shabab,\u201d says Mr Deni. The group has spread across the country. Few places are safe from the jihadists. To journey just a few hundred metres down the road from the international \u201cgreen zone\u201d by the airport to meet the president, your correspondent had to be accompanied by seven soldiers in a jeep and a mounted machinegun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Al-Shabab is well entrenched in the territories it controls. Its people still extort cash from businesses and conscript children into their guerrilla units. They also run courts and provide basic goods and services. The new president says that al-Shabab today collects more tax revenue than the federal government does. Local businessmen say the group mediates legal disputes more cleanly and efficiently than the official courts. \u201cThey\u2019ve established a state within a state,\u201d says the president.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">So does he have a coherent plan for fighting them? \u201cTo defeat al-Shabab the government must out-compete it on service delivery,\u201d argues Ahmed Abdullahi Sheikh, a former commander of the Danab, an American-trained fighting unit. Mr Mohamud, a moderate Islamist with links to the Muslim Brotherhood, also stresses ideology. \u201cOur vision is to take the Islamic narrative from al-Shabab and show the people that the state protects their faith. This means waging a multi-front war.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">That may be a bit glib. A lasting solution will probably also require negotiations with al-Shabab. During his previous term Mr Mohamud tried to win over defectors with promises of an amnesty, mainly in vain. Now he concedes that the battle will end at the negotiating table\u2014but not yet. The last big offensive against al-Shabab was in 2019. Mr Mohamud says he intends to launch a new one, first to contain the jihadists, then to push them back deeper into the countryside. In theory talks could then begin. In practice this could take years. Al-Shabab has certainly proved resilient as well as ruthless.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Mr Mohamud\u2019s previous term was a mixed bag. His cabinet was fractious and unstable. Corruption was especially rampant. Like his successor he failed to organise a direct election on time, settling instead for an indirect one whereby members of parliament were elected by delegates chosen by about 14,000 clan elders. He too was indirectly elected. This time, though, he comes armed with experience and a reservoir of goodwill. He will need to seize advantage of both.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The world\u2019s first WhatsAppocracy Government by social media in Somalia Cheap data, social media and creativity are filling in for an absent state Illustration: Lehel Kovacs Jan 23rd 2025|ADDIS ABABA THE ECONOMIST Thirty years\u00a0ago, making a phone call from Somalia &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2022\/06\/04\/somalia-today\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-16644","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-uncategorized"],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p2Ncip-4ks","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/16644","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=16644"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/16644\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":23771,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/16644\/revisions\/23771"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=16644"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=16644"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=16644"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
