Amber remaining in the ground disintegrates and most amber is \u201cmined\u201d from the sea bed when it is carried out to sea by streams, especially ones trapped under glaciers. The Baltic area is the greatest source of amber in the world as it doesn\u2019t have surf and gently sloping bottoms. Russia is the biggest producer followed by the Baltic countries.<br \/>\nThe bottom floor is full of furniture and paintings from the mansion.

In 1991, this 60ish man was at a dog show with his wife. She wanted a dog and he returned in 10 minutes with a small ceramic dog \u2013 and that was the start of the dog museum. In this small 3x3m room are glass cases, 8 shelves per case, all crammed with dog figurines made from 22 kinds of material (soap, straw, and amber may be the most unusual), from 37 countries. The majority are ceramic, the largest is wood and 80cms high and the smallest some 5mm earrings. There is nothing about real dogs here.<br \/>\nOccupying a larger space than the museum is his art gallery, all done by him. He also sells a small volume of poetry that he wrote. He is a rather flamboyant fellow, speaks not one word of English and gives an animated tour of his art, most of which is not so interesting except for his lovely miniatures.<br \/>\nEqually unusual is its location, in the bottom floor of a Soviet style apartment building that he uses for this purpose and as a studio, but lives elsewhere.

At 33,021ha and at its widest is 4km wide just north of Nida, Lithuania and the narrowest is 400m near the Russian village of Lesnoy. Its southern 46km long portion lies within Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia and its northern 52km within southwestern Lithania. At this northern end there is a narrow strait, across from which is Klaipeda.<br \/>\nThe spit was formed about the 3<sup>rd<\/sup> millennium BC from a glacial moraine with wind and sea currents later contributed enough sand to raise and keep it above sea level. As sand transport occurs from the southwest, if a large port construction with a pier, the spit would erode and eventually disappear. The more likely occurrence would be for the shallow bay inside the spit to fill up with sediment and create more land.<br \/>\nHistory. From 800-1016, Kaup was a major pagan trading center (it has not been excavated). In the 13<sup>th<\/sup> century, the Teutonic Knights occupied it building castles at Memel (1252), Neuhausen (1283) and Rossitten (1374). The last living speaker of the now-extinct Baltic language, Old Prussian, lived here.<br \/>\nDeforestation from building boats for the 1757 battle of Gross-Jagersdorf and overgrazing led to the dunes taking over the spit and burying entire villages. Large scale reforestation started in 1825 halted the dune formation and now covered by forest.<br \/>\nIn the 19<sup>th<\/sup> century it was inhabited by Kursenieki (Curonians) with a German minority in the south and a Lithuanian minority in the north. Before 1945, the spit was totally ethnic German and the Curonians are almost nonexistent today due to assimilation.<br \/>\nFrom the 19<sup>th<\/sup> century, the dune landscape around Nidden became popular with landscape and animal painters becoming an expressionist artist\u2019s colony.<br \/>\nUntil the 20<sup>th<\/sup> century, fishing was the main source of livelihood. The Rossiten Bird Observatory formed from 1901 to 1946. Thomas Mann summered here from 1929-32. The German population was expelled by force after WW II by the Soviets and ethnic cleansing also occurred and Russian settlers took over. Today ethnic Germans choose Nida especially for holidays.<br \/>\nToday. The spit is home to the highest moving (drifting) sand dunes in Europe at 35 to 60m in height. Habitat consists of wetlands, meadows, forests and dune ridges. It is on the Eastern Flywayand with 10-20 million birds flying over the spit in the spring and fall. Many stop to rest or breed.<br \/>\nThe Lithuanian settlements on the spit from north to south are Smityne, Alsnyne, Juodkrante, Pervalka, Preila, and Nida. A single road traverses the entire length. Because of the strait at the north end, access from Lithuania is by car ferry from Klaipeda. The largest town, Nida, is a popular holiday resort and tourist area with beaches best on the northern shores. Climbing the dunes is possible only at certain designated paths. A 13.8m high, 36 ton granite stone pillar is carved with hour and half hour, month and solstice and equinox notches to make a sundial at Parnidis Dune. Pollution and an offshore drilling facility are the major environmental issues. <strong><br \/>\n<\/strong>Curonian Spit is a <em>World Heritage Site (2000) shared by both Russia and Lithuania and is also in the NM \u201cXL\u201d series.<br \/>\n<\/em><strong>Getting There and Away<\/strong>. To access the Cruonian Spit from Lithuania, take a ferry from Klaipeda. My van was classified as an \u201cautobus\u201d, not a car and charged double (\u20ac24.00) for a 5-minute ferry ride. I tried to argue that it is only 4.9m long, has only 4 seats and is treated as a car on every other ferry I have ever taken, but the woman spoke no English and the argument fell on deaf ears. But the ferry back was free.<br \/>\n<strong>Curonian Spit National Park<\/strong> on the Lithuanian side is called Kursiu Nerija National Park and all human activity including climbing <strong>Parnidis Dune<\/strong> is prohibited. The entire spit about 5kms south of the ferry is National Park. Fee to access the park \u20ac20 and the booth is manned 24hrs\/day.<br \/>\n<strong>Naglial Self Guided Path.<\/strong> The only place to access the dunes is this 1.1km cognitive trail at Nagliali. It is a relatively young dune, only 1500 years old, and has decreased in size by 8m in the last hundred years. Where the parking lot is was once a very high, 3500 year old dune, now gone. It is about 15kms north of Nida. \u20ac2, open only from 9am to 6pm.<br \/>\nWith the ferry and park fees, visiting this place is expensive \u20ac44, for less than one day.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>JUODKRANTE<br \/>\n<\/strong>Juodkrante (literally: Black Shore, German: Schwarzort) has a permanent population of about 720 people. It is a quiet Lithuanian seaside resort village located on the Curonian Spit. A part of Neringa municipality, Juodkrant\u0117 is the second largest settlement on Lithuania&#8217;s part of the spit. Situated in Old Prussian territory it was for centuries a fishing village named Schwarzort, which underwent a tourist boom in the late 19th &#8211; early 20th century. After World War I this northern part of East Prussia was severed from Germany and the village became known as Juodkrant\u0117.<br \/>\n<strong>History<\/strong>. Juodkrant\u0117 was first mentioned (as Schwarzort) by the Teutonic Knights in 1429 in a letter describing storm damages. It was initially situated along the Baltic Sea shore, about 2.5\u00a0km from the present location. In the early 17th century, due to the Black Death, and moving sand dunes threatening to bury the village, it lost almost all of its inhabitants. In the 1680s, the village relocated to its present location along the Curonian Lagoon shore. The village did quite well in the new location: a tavern was opened in 1673, a school in 1743, and a wooden church in 1795. It grew in importance after Carwaiten\/Karvai\u010diai\/Karwaiten village was swallowed by traveling sand and the seat of the Church District relocated here. The wooden church burned down in 1878 but was soon replaced by a red brick church.<br \/>\nMajor developments took place in 1860s. In the late 1850s the lagoon waterway was deepened and now ferries could arrive. It was the easiest way to travel. In the course of the work, samples of amber were found. In 1860 the Stantien &amp; Becker company was founded to dig amber just north of the village. During 30 years of operations, it dug out about 2,250\u00a0tons of amber. At its peak the company employed about 1,000 workers. After the company relocated to Palmnicken (now Yantarny) in 1890, the population of Schwarzort dropped from 851 in 1885 to 423 in 1895.<br \/>\nThe tourist business was started in 1860s by Edward Stellmacher, who turned an old tavern house into a hotel named Kurischer Hof (now Gintaras). Because of the amber business, a new Juodkrant\u0117 was developed north of the old fishermen village. Many villas and hotels were built there. In the beginning of the 20th century there were 5 hotels, 20 villas, and a convalescent home Luisenbad. The new town was considered a luxury resort and attracted about 3,000 visitors a year. World War II destroyed the tourist business. Neringa was a strictly regulated border region. Only in the early 1960s tourists started to come back. However, Nida became a more popular destination for tourists. This allowed Juodkrant\u0117 to retain its old business &#8211; fishing. Sometimes it is referred to as the &#8220;capital of fishermen&#8221; and holds annual fishermen festival in July.<br \/>\n<strong>Amber treasure<\/strong>. Stantien &amp; Becker would dig up many pieces of amber shaped as amulets or knick-knacks. At first they would give them out as souvenirs, but then started collecting these items from the Mid Neolithic and the Bronze Ages. Richard Klebs, professor at K\u00f6nigsberg University, described 435 items (pendants, buttons, tubular beads, discs, and figurines of humans and animals) in his book Stone Age Amber Adornments in 1882. These ancient Schwarzorter Funde are considered to contain the earliest known amber carving finds from the Baltic Sea area (with amber carvings thousands of years older in other locations). About 150 items have detailed images. The collection was exhibited in Berlin, St. Petersburg, London, Chicago. After Klebs&#8217; death, K\u00f6nigsberg University purchased his collection. However, during the turbulent times of World War II and the expulsions from East Prussia most of the large collection in K\u00f6nigsberg was destroyed or stolen and only a few items were saved at G\u00f6ttingen University, previously the sister university of K\u00f6nigsberg. But scientists were able to make replicas from detailed illustrations in Klebs&#8217; book.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hill of Witches<\/strong> The sculpture park was started in 1979 and now has more than 70 wooden objects. Most of the figures are based on Lithuanian legends or folk tales. In both the \u201cBizzarium\u201d and \u201cSight\u201d series in NM, this wide trail through nice forest is festooned with fantastic, very creative wood sculptures \u2013 benches, totem poles, chairs, structures with cross beams, all intricately carved with a huge variety of faces and figures.<br \/>\nIt appeared that I started at the end and passed 53 sculptures walking to the top of the hill and maybe 150m past to the sign labeled #17. The trail appeared to continue on down to the town of Juodkrante making a loop by walking along the highway to return to the van. <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-s\/04\/92\/4a\/90\/raganu-kalnas.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Hill of Witches\" width=\"400\" height=\"282\" data-iml=\"1565487393724\" \/><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/736x\/28\/de\/fa\/28defa091a8f90bdd9505e7c7f40d4f2.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Hill of Witches\" width=\"364\" height=\"546\" data-iml=\"1565487477871\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Sculpture Park &#8220;Land and Water&#8221;<br \/>\n<\/strong>Another sculpture park was finished in 2002.

A settlement area of the Baltic Curonians, the original place called nida (&#8220;fluent&#8221; in the Old Prussian language) was first mentioned in 1385 as a fishing village. It was successively under the control of the Teutonic Knights, the Duchy of Prussia in 1525 and of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701.<br \/>\nIn 1709 nearly all of the population died from a bubonic plague epidemic. Continuously threatened by sand drifts, the village was moved away from the approaching dune to today&#8217;s position in the 1730s. Incorporated into the Prussian Province of East Prussia in 1773, it became part of the German Empire upon the German unification of 1871. In 1874 a lighthouse on Urbas hill was built, later destroyed in the war and rebuilt in 1945 and 1953.<br \/>\n<strong>Artists&#8217; colony. <\/strong>From the late 19th century, the dune landscape became popular with landscape and animal painters. The local inn of Herman Blode was the nucleus of the expressionist artists&#8217; colony. Artists included Lovis Corinth, Max Pechstein, Alfred Lichtwark, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, and Alfred Partikel, Julius Freymuth and Eduard Bischoff and the poets, Ernst Wiechert and Carl Zuckmayer.<br \/>\nAfter World War I Nidden, together with the northern half of the Curonian Spit (Kurische Nehrung), became part of the Klaip\u0117da Region under terms of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles and was annexed by Lithuania in 1923. Officially renamed Nida, the village nevertheless remained a predominantly German settlement; the border with the remaining German (East Prussian) half of the spit lay only a few kilometers to the south.<br \/>\n<strong>Thomas Mann<\/strong>. In 1929 Nobel Prize-winning writer Thomas Mann visited Nida and built a summer house on a hill above the lagoon. He and his family spent the summers of 1930\u201332 in the cottage, and parts of the epic novel Joseph and His Brothers (Joseph und seine Br\u00fcder) were written there. Threatened by the Nazis due to his political views, Mann left Germany after Hitler&#8217;s Machtergreifung in 1933 and eventually emigrated to the United States. After the Klaip\u0117da Region was again annexed by (now Nazified) Germany in 1939, his house was seized at the behest of Hermann G\u00f6ring and designated a recreation home for Luftwaffe officers.<br \/>\n<strong>Post-war.<\/strong> In 1939 the town had 736 inhabitants. Nida became nearly uninhabited, like all of the Curonian Spit, as a result of the Red Army advance and the Evacuation of East Prussia at the end of World War II, and the eventual expulsion of surviving German inhabitants. In the early postwar period, Nida was a little-visited fishing village. Later in Soviet times Nida, together with three other villages of the Neringa Municipality (Juodkrant\u0117, Preila and Pervalka), was a controlled-entry holiday region reserved for the Communist party officialdom and senior industry elite. Strict planning regulations, a ban on industrial development and generous municipal subsidies kept it unspoiled. Since independence, the area has been open to all, but the number of visitors is kept relatively low by the small number of hotel rooms and comparatively high rents.<br \/>\nMann&#8217;s summer cottage survived the war. The town is an upmarket holiday resort, hosting about 200,000 to 300,000 tourists each summer, mostly Lithuanians, Germans, Latvians, and Russians. It is characterized by low-key entertainment and a distinct family focus. However, during recent years it has become a decent point of interest for fine electronica music and modern art shows at an eclectic forest retreat.<br \/>\nSince 2001, a jazz festival has been held every year. A local radio station Neringa FM streams live beats over FM and online. There are also interesting places to see nearby, including some of the highest sand dunes in Europe, a large sundial (which has been restored after being damaged by a Baltic gale), fisherman&#8217;s ethnographic museum, gallery-museum of amber and a German Protestant (Evangelische) Brick Gothic church (built in 1888). There is also a campsite.<br \/>\nThe town is known for Nidden Kurenwimpel \u2014 German for &#8220;Curonian pennants&#8221; \u2014 ornate carved flags peculiar to local families resident on the Curonian Spit. The flags, replicas of which can be seen around Nida, feature animal and human figures as pictograms reminiscent of a pagan writing tradition. At the local cemetery, examples of krik\u0161tas (pl. krik\u0161tai), pagan burial markers in place of tombstones, can still be seen.<br \/>\nNida&#8217;s beach participates in the Blue Flag Programme. Nudists make use of parts of the beach near Nida for nude bathing.<br \/>\n<strong>Transportation. <\/strong>Nida Airport is located in the town, but it has no scheduled routes and only capable of handling small aircraft. Nida also has a seaport which is used for ferries and fishing boats. The only road which runs along the whole length of the Curonian Spit, connecting Zelenogradsk and Smiltyn\u0117 (where a ferry connection to Klaip\u0117da exists), passes through the edge of Nida. An hourly bus runs between Nida and Smiltyn\u0117 ferry terminal on that road, and intercity buses to various cities like Kaliningrad, Klaip\u0117da, Kaunas and Vilnius exist.<br \/>\n<strong>Nida Beach<\/strong>. A very nice beach with boardwalk, 6 beach volleyball courts, frequent changing areas and fine white sand. When I was there, a big thunder and lightning storm was brewing and surf was big.<br \/>\n<em>I drove the length of the spit in the early morning paying my <\/em><em>\u20ac20 entrance fee to the park.

The town was reclaimed by Nazi Germany in 1939. During World War II, the Stalag Luft VI prisoner-of-war camp was located near Heydekrug; it was the northernmost POW camp within the confines of the German Reich.<br \/>\nThere remain many old buildings in \u0160ilut\u0117: an old post office (1905), a fire station (1911), a court building and prison (1848), a bridge across the Sziesze (\u0160y\u0161a) (1914), an estate of H. Scheu (1818), an old market square, a harbor, railway station and a bridge (1875), and the Vyd\u016bnas gymnasium.<br \/>\nThe economy is based on agricultural products and a distillery.<br \/>\n<strong>Rusne Island.<\/strong> About 9kms west of \u0160ilut\u0117,it is located between Atmata and Skirvyt\u0117,\u00a0distributaries\u00a0of the\u00a0Neman River, and the\u00a0Curonian Lagoon. At 45 or 46 square kilometers, Rusn\u0117 is often named as the largest island of Lithuania. The island\u2019s age has been estimated at 1,100 years, formed when the Neman River deposited its sediments before flowing into the Curonian Lagoon. The elevation does not exceed 1.5 metres. One point in the island is 0.27 metres below sea level, which is the lowest elevation in Lithuania.<br \/>\nThe island is subject to frequent flooding, particularly in spring due to\u00a0ice dams. Floodwaters are removed by pumping, using an extensive system of canals and\u00a0polders.<br \/>\nThe main businesses in the island are sailing, canoeing tourism, and fishing. The town of Rusn\u0117, with 1,600 inhabitants, is the largest populated place on the island. The only bridge between the mainland and the island leads to Rusn\u0117. After\u00a01990,\u00a0collective farming ended and individual landowners lacked the resources to clear the fields.\u00a0This led to the growth of vegetation inhospitable to migratory birds, an internationally problematic issue since the island lies within the\u00a0East Atlantic Flyway.
