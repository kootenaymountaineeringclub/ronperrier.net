Built in 1910, he created 220 paintings in the garden, a carefully planned space by Lieberman. At his death, it was confiscated by the Nazis and used as a hospital and sports clubhouse and renovated between 2002-06. The garden is a magnificent collection of vegetables and flowers.

On January 20, 1942, 15 high-ranking representatives of the SS, the NSDAP and various ministries met to discuss the planned deportation and murder of European Jews. It was chaired by Reinhard Heydrich, head of Reich Security. The SS presented campaigns and their killing methods already carried out since August 1941 in the Soviet Union. The deportation expert, Adolf Eichmann drew up the protocol found in 1947 that documents with alarming clarity the plan to murder all European Jews.<br \/>\nThe exhibit documents the prehistory of Jewish persecution, the deprivation of rights and expulsions from 1933-39, the deportations, ghettos and murder.

It comes in several editions, but I purchased the \u201cAll Inclusive\u201d version that gave free admission to several museums instead of simple discounts as in the normal card. I also foolishly added the transportation, unnecessary as parking in Berlin is so easy.

The card is usually shown at the beginning of exhibits not the ticket desk.<br \/>\nIncludes 17 museums (+ discounts, usually 25%, at many others), 6 attractions, many sightseeing, boat, bicycle and guided tours and discounts at restaurants and shopping. \u20ac79 (\u20ac10 for the transportation)<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nAdlerm\u00fchle<\/strong> (Mariendrof Eagle Mill), Mariendorf.

It worked again operating on wind power until 1931, then electric drive until 1959. A swimming club Friesen established a swimming club in it in 1968. It is about 2 blocks SW of the restaurant.

In 1946, the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SDD) merged to form the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) and remained in power until 1989. In a position of power, they were based on forced threats, rewards and privilege, controlling everything (including elections) but the churches. They used the Ministry of State Security (MfS) to secure the SED dictatorship. On May 8, 1945, Germany and Berlin were divided into 4 zones of occupation \u2013 France, Britain, USA and the Soviets. After October 1949, the Soviets controlled the SED and GDR.<br \/>\nHas great displays showing life in the GDR.

The MfS (Stasi) employees could not have had Nazi affiliations, relatives in West Germany, many had been persecuted by the Nazis or had had Soviet military or secret police training. They propagated heavy propaganda against the West. The employees had special hospitals, shops 18,000 flats, 300 recreation facilities and other special privileges. The facilities used by them grew from one building to 54 acres with 50 office buildings with House 1 (the museum) being the main office. There were 91,000 officers employed and 180,000 informers worked for them. They infiltrated every aspect of East German society using phone taps and monitoring devices. 250,000 citizens were jailed. The inner German border was 1,378kms long. \u20ac8*<br \/>\n<strong>Skatehalle.<\/strong> In a rough neighborhood of old brick warehouses covered in graffiti, this skate park is in a large warehouse with a steel truss roof.

Between 1949 and 1961, 2.7 million East Germans left for the west primarily through West Berlin. To stop the intellectual and manpower drain, they built the Berlin Wall that was completed in August 1961, preventing all access to West Berlin. 65,000 people woke up with no access to their jobs.<br \/>\nThe wall completely encircled West Berlin averaging about 100m wide: 127.5kms of alarmed fence, 124.3kms of patrol road, no man\u2019s land with a strip of sand showing any footprints and then 156.4kms of the steel reinforced concrete border wall. The wall was 3m high, made of reinforced concrete with a steel pipe over the top preventing pulling one up and a concrete foot pointed into the border strip to prevent vehicles from toppling a section. There were 302 observation towers with guards instructed to shoot to kill anyone in the border area. 136 eventually died trying to cross, 92 of them shot.<br \/>\nCheckpoint Charlie was the only crossing. Automatic guns were set up that were only removed after international objection in 1983. The major demonstration occurred in Leipzig in Oct 1989 with 70,000 demonstrators.<br \/>\nThe border finally opened on Nov 9, 1989.<br \/>\n<strong>Berlin Wall remnants.<\/strong> I saw the piece of wall from Potsdamer Platz (the part of the Berlin Wall next to West Berlin \u2013 covered in graffiti on the west side) that was in the Black Box museum lot.<br \/>\nThe other sections of wall remaining are at Niederkirchnerstra\u03b2e, the Berlin Wall Memorial on Bernauer Stra\u03b2e and three observation towers. In several places, there is a double row of cobbles crossing streets and sidewalks marking the location.<br \/>\nThis area around the Friedrichstra\u03b2e Border Crossing (Checkpoint Charlie) is wildly touristed. In the cold war, Soviet and American tanks faced off each other at the checkpoint. Only West German citizens and foreigners were allowed to cross at <strong>Mossehaus<\/strong>\u00a0(Mosse-Zentrum Service GmbH). In the NM \u201cModern architecture buildings\u201d series, this small office building has a total glass front covered by a bronze aluminum grill with curved holes to indicate windows.<br \/>\n<strong>Brandenburg Gate<\/strong>. One of the iconic Berlin sights, this was built in 1793 as a neoclassical monument built by the Prussian king Frederick William II to represent peace as a triumphal arch. It was built on the site of a former city gate (one of the 18 gates in the Berlin Customs Wall) that marked the start of the road from Berlin to Brandenburg and the entry to the renowned boulevard of linden trees that led directly to the royal City Palace of the Prussian monarchs. Throughout its existence, it has been considered a symbol of the tumultuous history of Europe and Germany but also of European unity and peace.<br \/>\nThe gate consists of twelve Doric columns, six to each side, forming five passageways. Atop the gate is a Quadriga, a chariot drawn by four horses ridden by Victoria equipped with a Prussian eagle and iron cross on her lance with a wreath of oak leaves.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/www.dw.com\/image\/42653978_304.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Brandenburg Gate.\" width=\"623\" height=\"350\" \/><\/p>\n<p>After Napoleon defeated Prussia in 1806, he took the Quadriga to Paris, but it was returned when the Prussians occupied Paris in 1814. The Nazis used the gate as a party symbol. It was damaged in WW II with bullet holes in the columns and only one horses head surviving. After the war, it was in East Berlin and closed when the Berlin Wall was built in 1961 until 1989 when it symbolized freedom and the desire to unify the city of Berlin. The wall around it was demolished the following year. It was extensively refurbished from 2000-02.<br \/>\nAt the official ceremony on the reunification of Germany in 1990, the flag of the new German republic was raised over the gate. On the 20<sup>th<\/sup> anniversary of the fall or the Berlin Wall in 2009, 1000 \u2013 2.5m tall dominoes were toppled in stages converging here. When Germany won the 2014 FIFA world cup, the German National Team held their victory rally in front of the gate.<br \/>\n<strong>New Synagogue<\/strong>. With its imposing dome, it was built in 1860 and was the largest synagogue in Germany. It was severely damaged in WW II and rebuilt since 1996, now holding a museum on Jewish life.
