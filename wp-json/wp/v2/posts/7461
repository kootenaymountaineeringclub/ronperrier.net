It\u2019s mutual, too. I&#8217;ve thrashed my way up the bush in that drainage more times than I care to remember. It is thick, it is wet (always), it is slippery, it is pointy, spiky and generally unpleasant. I swear, neither love nor money could make me go back. But I&#8217;ve said that before. Several times. Like after climbing Titei. And after climbing Blacktail. And after climbing Long &#8230; And finally, after not climbing Nasokwen. Which brings us to this story. In June of 2010, Sandra convinced me I was being a girly man and the bush just wasn&#8217;t that bad (fool me once, shame on you, fool me 3 times &#8230;) and that going up Nasokwen was a great idea. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">So it was, Sandra McGuinness, Jen Kyler, Micha Forestell, and I banged the truck up the remains of the Silverton Creek FSR, put on our Kevlar clothing, strapped on protective eyewear, ducked our heads, and entered into The Forbidden Forest. Several days later we emerged, bloodied and bruised, into the sub-alpine in the impressive cirque on the north side of Titei. We easily crossed over the crest of Wilfred Ridge, and gazed, downcast, at the turreted and corniced ridge running east to Nasokwen. We had more chance of spying a Bowtruckle than traversing that ridge in soft early-summer snow conditions. A short jaunt down the nearby SE trending ridge triggered a class 2 wet slide, which we took as a reasonably unambiguous sign that continuing would be foolhardy. We begrudgingly accepted that would be facing the Hippogriffs on the way home without a summit to embolden us. Home we went. Never again would I risk life and limb in that ghastly forest. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Well, I hate not making the summit. I really hate it. Especially when there are no recorded ascents. Surely the bush wasn&#8217;t as bad as I remember it? If we went a little later in the year, the snow would be better &#8230; <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Fast forward to July 1, 2011. Sandra is out with a sprained ankle, so it is Jen, Vicki Hart, and I who again tackle the beasts of The Forbidden Forest with only ice axes for defence. Guess what? It was wet and nasty, and I whined the whole way. This time it only took us a day and a half to clear the bush and escape into the Titei Cirque, Vicki and I coughing up bits of lung trying to keep up with the Eveready Bunny. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Our route was the same as last time: from the lake at 863-240 (6750&#8242;), we climbed east up moderate snow to the ridge connecting Long Mountain to Wilfred Ridge (around 869-246, 7600&#8242;), then easy scrambling south to the west ridge of Nasokwen. This time, snow conditions cooperated, and we easily descended moderate snow down the south ridge and then northeast down a snow gully into the basin on the south side of Nasokwen. From there, it was a straightforward grind up the south slopes of Nasokwen to the top. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">It is double-summitted, with the east peak slightly more sporting than the west \u2013 we climbed both to make sure. It being Canada Day, Vicki had brought a Canadian flag, and we patriotically took pictures our ourselves adorned with our nation&#8217;s emblem. No recorded ascents, no cairn on top, and Kratky-san knows of no ascents: that&#8217;s good enough for me, I&#8217;m claiming the FA. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">One more time through the dastardly bush, this time softened by the euphoria of our conquest, and we were back at the truck. I will never go up Silverton Creek again. I will never go up Silverton Creek again. I will never &#8230; <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Nasokwen Mountain from Silverton Creek, via south slopes, 1 July 2011.
