He is always in a good mood and always has something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, &#8216;If I were any better, I would be twins!&#8217;<br \/>\nHe was a natural motivator.<br \/>\nIf an employee was having a bad day, John was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.<br \/>\nSeeing this style really made me curious, so one day I went up and asked him, &#8216;I don&#8217;t get it! You can&#8217;t be a positive person all of the time.  How do you do it?&#8217;<br \/>\nHe replied, &#8216;Each morning I wake up and say to myself, you have two choices today. You can choose to be in a good mood or&#8230;you can choose   to be in a bad mood. I choose to be in a good mood.&#8217; Each time something bad happens, I can choose to be a victim or&#8230;I can choose to learn from it.  I choose to learn from it. Every time someone comes to me complaining, I can choose to accept their complaining or&#8230;I can point out the positive side of life.  I choose the positive side of life.<br \/>\n&#8216;Yeah, right, it&#8217;s not that easy,&#8217; I protested.<br \/>\n&#8216;Yes, it is,&#8217; he said.  &#8216;Life is all about choices.  When you cut away all the junk, every situation is a choice.  You choose how you react to situations.  You choose how people affect your mood. You choose to be in a good mood or bad mood.  The bottom line:  It&#8217;s your choice how you live your life.&#8217;<br \/>\nI reflected on what he said.  Soon hereafter, I left the Tower Industry to start my own business.  We lost touch, but I often thought about him when I made a choice about life instead of reacting to it.<\/p>\n<p>Several years later, I heard that he was involved in a serious accident, falling some 60 feet from a communications tower.<br \/>\nAfter 18 hours of surgery and weeks of intensive care, he was released from the hospital with rods placed in his back.<br \/>\nI saw him about six months after the accident.<br \/>\nWhen I asked him how he was, he replied, &#8216;If I were any better, I&#8217;d be twins&#8230;Wanna see my scars?&#8217;<br \/>\nI declined to see his wounds, but I did ask him what had gone through his mind as the accident took place.<br \/>\n&#8216;The first thing that went through my mind was the well-being of my soon-to- be born daughter,&#8217; he replied.  &#8216;Then, as I lay on the ground, I remembered that I had two choices:  I could choose to live or&#8230;I could choose to die.  I chose to live.&#8217;<br \/>\n&#8216;Weren&#8217;t you scared?  Did you lose consciousness?&#8217;  I asked.<br \/>\nHe continued, &#8216;&#8230;the paramedics were great. They kept telling me I was going to be fine. But when they wheeled me into the ER and I saw the expressions on the faces of the doctors and nurses, I got really scared. In their eyes, I read &#8216;he&#8217;s a dead man&#8217;. I knew I needed to take action.&#8217;<br \/>\n&#8216;What did you do?&#8217; I asked.<br \/>\n&#8216;Well, there was a big burly nurse shouting questions at me,&#8217; said John. &#8216;She asked if I was allergic to anything &#8216;Yes, I replied.&#8217; The doctors and nurses stopped working as they waited for my reply. I took a deep breath and yelled, &#8216;Gravity&#8217;. Over their laughter, I told them, &#8216;I am choosing to live.  Operate on me as if I am alive, not dead.&#8217; <\/p>\n<p>He lived, thanks to the skill of his doctors, but also because of his amazing attitude&#8230;I learned from him that every day we have the choice to live fully.<br \/>\nAttitude, after all, is everything .<br \/>\nTherefore, do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself.  Each day has enough trouble of its own.&#8217;<br \/>\nAfter all today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Read this: LET IT REALLY SINK IN&#8230;&#8230;THEN CHOOSE John is the kind of guy you love to hate.
