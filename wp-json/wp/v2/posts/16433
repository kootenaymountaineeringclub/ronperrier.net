Tourism, generates 45% of GDP together with the offshore financial industry.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Capital:<\/strong>\u00a0Road Town<br \/>\n<strong>Currency<\/strong>: USD<br \/>\n<strong>Population:<\/strong>\u00a031700<br \/>\n<strong>County Code:<\/strong>\u00a0+1284<br \/>\n<strong>Visa.<\/strong>\u00a0Separate border control from the United Kingdom. Nationals of most Western countries do not require a visa.<br \/>\n<strong>Covid.<\/strong> No tests or bubbling are necessary. We were allowed to travel independently. Other rules are similar to everywhere else.<\/p>\n<p><em>We arrived at Tortola, BVI at about 6am, had breakfast and got a Covid antigen test at 7 (necessary for our stop at St Maarten). We immediately left the ship and went into Roadtown. I had rented a car from Alamo the night before and went to the rental agency. I had not really looked what there was to see on BVI (not much) so cancelled the car and went to the ferry terminal 2 minutes away to get a ferry to Virgen Gorda and see the Baths.<br \/>\nOne of the ship\u2019s tours was to here (3\u00bd hours $100). The ferry leaves at 08:30 and returns at 13:45 and 16:45 ($38 including bus to the Baths). The crossing to Spanish Town and Virgen Gorda took 32 minutes and the drive to the Baths a few minutes. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>VIRGIN GORDA.\u00a0<\/strong>The third-largest island (after\u00a0Tortola\u00a0and\u00a0Anegada), about 21\u00a0km<sup>2<\/sup>. The main commercial and residential area is\u00a0Spanish Town\u00a0on the southwestern part of the island.<br \/>\nNorth of the Baths is the Virgin Gorda Yacht Harbor, formerly owned by Little Dix Bay. The most notable ruin on Virgin Gorda is the old\u00a0Copper Mine.<br \/>\nOne of the great harbours of the world, North Sound, and historically Gorda Sound, lies at the northeast end of the island. It is bordered by four islands and connecting reef systems that keep the sound calm, creating one of the world\u2019s great watersports meccas, with over 3,000 acres (1,200\u00a0ha) of protected waters. At the eastern end of the sound is the premier anchorage, in the lee of Biras Hill (elevation 435\u00a0ft (133\u00a0m)). The village, resort, and marina at this point (Jon\u2019O\u2019Point) is called the Bitter End Yacht Club, and runs for about a mile of coastline.<br \/>\n<strong>Devil\u2019s Bay National Park.\u00a0<\/strong>58 acres; 15-minute hike from the top of The Baths on Virgin Gorda\u2019s south-western tip. Beaches tranquil swimming and snorkelling. At the southern end is a trail to Stoney Bay.<br \/>\n<strong>The Baths.\u00a0<\/strong>7 acres on Virgin Gorda\u2019s north shore, a geological wonder comprised of massive granite boulders as large as 40 feet in diameter, white sand beaches and sheltered sea pools on the beach\u2019s edge.\u00a0This popular daytime anchorage is ideal for swimming and snorkelling.<br \/>\nHuge\u00a0granite\u00a0boulders lie in piles on the beach, forming scenic\u00a0grottoes\u00a0that are open to the sea. Granite is an intrusive igneous rock, thus not volcanic. It did form from magma, however, at great depth. Granite becomes exposed at surface only after geologic ages of erosion removes the overburden. Further erosion broke the granite into large boulders and rounded their surfaces.<br \/>\nA loop trail leads to Stoney Rocks, Devil\u2019s Bay (swimming) and continues through the Baths through the granite boulders, where hikers crawl, climb ladders and wade through water. There is a huge arch and a pool surrounded by high rock, the classic photo of the area. End at is a great beach with food, drinks, many picnic tables and the chance to swim and snorkel. Walk back up the good trail to the original.<\/p>\n<p><em>We returned to Tortola on the boat at 13:45.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>TOTOLA\u00a0<\/strong>(pop 24,000, 9,400 in Roadtown). Largest and most populated of the\u00a0British Virgin Islands. Tortola is mountainous, 19\u00a0km by 5\u00a0km with an area of 55.7\u00a0km2\u00a0(21.5\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). Formed by\u00a0volcanic activity, it\u00a0lies near an\u00a0earthquake\u00a0fault, and minor earthquakes are common. Mount Sage\u00a0(530m) is its highest point.<br \/>\nUses the US dollar due to its proximity to and frequent trade with the US Virgin Islands and\u00a0Puerto Rico. The island is home to many\u00a0offshore companies\u00a0that do business worldwide.\u00a0Financial services\u00a0are a major part of the country\u2019s economy.<br \/>\nIn September 2017,\u00a0Hurricane Irma produced\u00a0severe destruction on Tortola.<br \/>\nThe Northern coast has the best beaches on the island, including Smuggler\u2019s Cove, Long Bay, Cane Garden Bay, Brewer\u2019s Bay, Josiah\u2019s Bay, and Lambert beach. Visit historic sites and hike in parks.<br \/>\n<strong>Botanical Gardens. <\/strong>A 1.5 km walk from the pier, this small 3-acre garden is lovely with a flower circle walk, many flowering shrubs and trees, several varieties of palms, a few large trees (including a baobab tree)<strong>, <\/strong>a fallen fig tree, cacti, guava, and a good selection of other plants. The hurricane caused the fallen fig and many fallen royal palms and destroyed the building on the grounds. $3<br \/>\n<strong>Sage Mountain NP.\u00a0<\/strong>86 acres. The farmland was reforested with white cedar and West Indian and Honduran mahongany trees. 1,716 feet, with panoramic views of all the islands. More rain on the northern side with old growth forest, and large boulders and old pastures and remnant dry forest on the south. Twelve trails with loops creating a circular route.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Get in<br \/>\nBy plane.\u00a0<\/strong>Flights change planes in San Juan,\u00a0Puerto Rico\u00a0(North America and Spain),\u00a0Antigua\u00a0(for the UK) or\u00a0Saint Martin\u00a0(for the Netherlands and France) since the\u00a0Beef Island\u00a0airport cannot accommodate large aircraft.<br \/>\n<em>Via St. Thomas\u00a0<\/em>(STT). Fly to St. Thomas, then a ferry is cheap.<br \/>\n<strong>Get Around<br \/>\nBy car\u00a0<\/strong>on Virgin Gorda\u00a0and\u00a0Tortola, scooter on Jost Van Dyke.
