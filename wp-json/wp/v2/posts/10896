Its capital is\u00a0Valletta, which is the smallest national capital in the\u00a0European Union\u00a0by area at 0.8\u00a0km.2\u00a0The official languages are\u00a0Maltese\u00a0and English, with Maltese officially recognised as the national language and the only\u00a0Semitic language\u00a0in the European Union.\r\nMalta has been inhabited since approximately 5900 BC. Its location in the centre of the Mediterranean has historically given it great strategic importance as a naval base, with a succession of powers having contested and ruled the islands, including the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Greeks, Byzantines, Arabs, Normans, Sicilians, Spanish, Knights of St. John, French, and British. Most of these foreign influences have left some sort of mark on the country&#8217;s ancient culture.\r\nMalta became a British colony in 1815, serving as a way station for ships and the headquarters for the British Mediterranean Fleet. It played an important role in the Allied war effort during the Second World War, and was subsequently awarded the George Cross for its bravery in the face of an\u00a0Axis siege, and the George Cross appears on Malta&#8217;s national flag.\u00a0The British Parliament passed the Malta Independence Act in 1964, giving Malta independence from the United Kingdom as the State of Malta, with Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state and queen.\u00a0The country became a republic in 1974. It has been a member state of the\u00a0Commonwealth of Nations\u00a0and the\u00a0United Nations\u00a0since independence, and joined the\u00a0European Union\u00a0in 2004; it became part of the\u00a0eurozone\u00a0monetary union in 2008.\r\nMalta has a long Christian legacy and its Archdiocese is claimed to be an\u00a0apostolic see\u00a0because\u00a0Paul the Apostle\u00a0was shipwrecked on &#8220;Melita&#8221;, according to\u00a0Acts of the Apostles,\u00a0which is now widely taken to be Malta. While Catholicism is the official religion in Malta, Article 40 of the Constitution states that &#8220;all persons in Malta shall have full freedom of conscience and enjoy the free exercise of their respective mode of religious worship.&#8221;\r\nMalta is a popular tourist destination with its warm climate, numerous recreational areas, and architectural and historical monuments, including three UNESCO World Heritage Sites:\u00a0Hypogeum of \u0126al-Saflieni, Valletta,\u00a0and seven\u00a0megalithic temples\u00a0which are some of the oldest free-standing structures in the world.\r\n\r\n<strong>Etymology.<\/strong> The origin of the name\u00a0Malta\u00a0is uncertain, and the modern-day variation is derived from the Maltese language. The most common etymology is it\u00a0is derived from the Greek word\u00a0meli, &#8220;honey&#8221;.\u00a0The ancient Greeks called the island\u00a0melit\u0113 meaning &#8220;honey-sweet&#8221;, possibly for Malta&#8217;s unique production of honey; an endemic subspecies of\u00a0bee\u00a0lives on the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>HISTORY<\/strong>\r\nMalta has been inhabited from around 5900 BC,\u00a0since the arrival of settlers from the Sicily. A significant prehistoric\u00a0Neolithic\u00a0culture marked by\u00a0Megalithic structures, which date back to c. 3600 BC, existed on the islands, as evidenced by the temples of\u00a0Mnajdra,\u00a0Ggantija\u00a0and others. The\u00a0Phoenicians\u00a0colonised Malta between 800\u2013700 BC, bringing their\u00a0Semitic language\u00a0and culture.\u00a0They used the islands as an outpost from which they expanded sea explorations and trade in the Mediterranean until their successors, the\u00a0Carthaginians, were ousted by the\u00a0Romans\u00a0in 216 BC with the help of the Maltese inhabitants, under whom Malta became a\u00a0municipium.\r\nAfter a period of Byzantine rule (4th to 9th century) and a probable sack by the Vandals the islands were invaded by the Aghlabids in AD 870. The fate of the population after the Arab invasion is unclear but it seems the islands may have been completely depopulated and were likely to have been repopulated in the beginning of the second millennium by settlers from Arab-ruled Sicily who spoke Siculo-Arabic.\r\nThe Muslim rule was ended by the\u00a0Normans\u00a0who conquered the island in 1091. The islands were completely re-Christianised by 1249. The islands were part of the\u00a0Kingdom of Sicily\u00a0until 1530, and were briefly controlled by the\u00a0Capetian House of Anjou. In 1530\u00a0Charles I of Spain\u00a0gave the Maltese islands to the\u00a0Order of Knights of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem\u00a0in perpetual lease.\r\nThe French under\u00a0Napoleon\u00a0took hold of the Maltese islands in 1798, although with the aid of the British the Maltese were able to oust French control two years later. The inhabitants subsequently asked Britain to assume sovereignty over the islands under the conditions laid out in a Declaration of Rights,\u00a0stating that &#8220;his Majesty has no right to cede these Islands to any power&#8230;if he chooses to withdraw his protection, and abandon his sovereignty, the right of electing another sovereign, or of the governing of these Islands, belongs to us, the inhabitants and aborigines alone, and without control.&#8221; As part of the\u00a0Treaty of Paris in 1814, Malta became a British colony, ultimately rejecting an attempted integration with the United Kingdom in 1956.\r\nMalta became independent on 21 September 1964 (Independence Day). Under its 1964 constitution Malta initially retained Queen Elizabeth II as Queen of Malta, with a Governor-General exercising executive authority on her behalf. On 13 December 1974 (Republic Day) it became a republic within the Commonwealth, with the President as head of state. On 31 March 1979 Malta saw the withdrawal of the last British troops and the Royal Navy from Malta. This day is known as Freedom Day and Malta declared itself as a neutral and non-aligned state. Malta joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 and joined the Eurzone on 1 January 2008.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>POLITICS, GOVERNMENT AND LAW <\/strong>\r\nMalta is a republic\u00a0whose\u00a0parliamentary system\u00a0and\u00a0public administration\u00a0are closely modelled on the\u00a0Westminster system. Malta had the second-highest\u00a0voter turnout\u00a0in the world (and the highest for nations without\u00a0mandatory voting), based on election turnout in national\u00a0lower house\u00a0elections from 1960 to 1995. The\u00a0unicameral\u00a0Parliament is made up of the President and the\u00a0House of Representatives (Maltese:\u00a0Kamra tad-Deputati), which is elected by direct universal suffrage through\u00a0single transferable vote\u00a0every five years, unless the House is dissolved earlier by the\u00a0President\u00a0either on advice of the\u00a0Prime Minister\u00a0or through the adoption of a motion of no confidence carried within the\u00a0House of Representatives\u00a0and not overturned within three days. The House of Representatives is nominally made up of 65 members of parliament whereby 5 members of parliament are elected from each of the thirteen electoral districts. The\u00a0President of Malta\u00a0is appointed for a five-year term by a resolution of the House of Representatives carried by a simple majority. The role of the president as head of state is largely ceremonial.\r\n<strong>Military <\/strong>\r\nThe primary aim of defending the islands&#8217; integrity is achieved by emphasising the maintenance of Malta&#8217;s territorial waters and airspace integrity.\r\n\r\n<strong>GEOGRAPHY <\/strong>\r\nMalta is an\u00a0archipelago\u00a0in the central\u00a0Mediterranean\u00a0(in its eastern basin), some 80\u00a0km (50\u00a0mi) south of the Italian island of\u00a0Sicily\u00a0across the\u00a0Malta Channel. Only the three largest islands\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Malta\u00a0(Malta),\u00a0Gozo\u00a0(G\u0127awdex) and\u00a0Comino\u00a0(Kemmuna)\u00a0\u2013 are inhabited. The smaller islands are uninhabited. The islands of the archipelago lie on the Malta plateau, a shallow shelf formed from the high points of a\u00a0land bridge\u00a0between Sicily and North Africa that became isolated as sea levels rose after the last\u00a0Ice Age. The archipelago is therefore situated in the zone between the Eurasian and African tectonic plates.\u00a0Malta was considered an island of North Africa for centuries.\r\nNumerous bays along the indented coastline of the islands provide good harbours. The landscape consists of low hills with terraced fields. The highest point in Malta is\u00a0Ta&#8217; Dmejrek, at 253\u00a0m (830\u00a0ft), near\u00a0Dingli. Although there are some small rivers at times of high rainfall, there are no permanent rivers or lakes on Malta. However, some watercourses have fresh water running all year round at\u00a0Ba\u0127rija\u00a0near\u00a0Ras ir-Ra\u0127eb, at l-Imta\u0127leb and San Martin, and at Lunzjata Valley in Gozo.\r\nThe territory of Malta belongs to the\u00a0ecoregion\u00a0of &#8220;Mediterranean Forests, Woodlands and Scrub&#8221;.\r\n<strong>Climate<\/strong>\r\nThe annual average\u00a0relative humidity\u00a0is high, averaging 75%, ranging from 65% in July (morning: 78% evening: 53%) to 80% in December.\r\nSunshine duration\u00a0hours total around 3,000 per year, from an average 5.2 hours of sunshine duration per day in December to an average above 12 hours in July.\u00a0This is about double that of cities in the northern half of Europe.\r\n\r\n<strong>URBAN AREAS<\/strong>\r\nMalta is composed of two\u00a0larger urban zones\u00a0nominally referred to as &#8220;Valletta&#8221; (the main island of Malta) and &#8220;Gozo&#8221;. Main urban area covers the entire main island, with a population of around 400,000.\u00a0The core of the urban area &#8211;\u00a0greater city\u00a0of Valletta has a population of 205,768.\u00a0According to\u00a0Demographia, Valletta\u00a0urban area\u00a0has a population of 300,000. It is identified as functional urban area (FUA) with the population of 355,000 &#8211; about 95 per cent of the area of Malta is urban and the number grows every year. With area of 316\u00a0km2\u00a0(122\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and population of 0.4\u00a0million, is one of the\u00a0most densely populated\u00a0countries worldwide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>FLORA<\/strong>\r\nThe Maltese islands are home to a wide diversity of indigenous, sub-endemic and endemic plants. They feature many traits typical of a Mediterranean climate, such as drought resistance. The most common indigenous trees on the islands are olive, carob, fig, holm oak and Aleppo pine while the most common non-native trees are eucalyptus, acacia and opuntia. Endemic plants include the national flower widnet il-ba\u0127a, sempreviva ta&#8217; Malta, \u017cigland t&#8217; G\u0127awdex and \u0121i\u017ci ta&#8217; Malta. The flora and biodiversity of Malta is severely endangered by habitat loss, invasive species and human intervention.\r\n\r\n<strong>ECONOMY<\/strong>\r\nMalta is classified as an advanced economy.\u00a0Until 1800 Malta depended on cotton, tobacco and its shipyards for exports. Once under British control, they came to depend on\u00a0Malta Dockyard\u00a0for support of the\u00a0Royal Navy, especially during the\u00a0Crimean War\u00a0of 1854. The military base benefited craftsmen and all those who served the military.\r\nIn 1869, the opening of the\u00a0Suez Canal\u00a0gave Malta&#8217;s economy a great boost, as there was a massive increase in the shipping that entered the port. Ships stopping at Malta&#8217;s docks for refuelling helped the\u00a0Entrep\u00f4t\u00a0trade, which brought additional benefits to the island.\r\nCurrently, Malta&#8217;s major resources are limestone, a favourable geographic location and a productive labour force. Malta produces only about 20 per cent of its food needs, has limited freshwater supplies because of the drought in the summer and has no domestic energy sources, aside from the potential for solar energy from its plentiful sunlight. The economy is dependent on foreign trade (serving as a freight trans-shipment point), manufacturing (especially electronics and textiles) and tourism.\r\nFilm production is a growing contributor to the Maltese economy. The first film was shot in Malta in 1925 (Sons of the Sea); over 100 feature films have been entirely or partially filmed in the country since then. Malta has served as a &#8220;double&#8221; for a wide variety of locations and historic periods including Ancient Greece, Ancient and Modern Rome, Iraq, the Middle East and many more.\r\nMalta does not have a property tax. Its property market, especially around the harbour area, has been in constant boom, with the prices of apartments in some towns like St Julian&#8217;s, Sliema and Gzira skyrocketing.\r\nMaltese GDP per capita stood at 88 per cent of the EU average in 2015 with \u20ac21,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>TRANSPORT <\/strong>\r\nTraffic in Malta\u00a0drives on the left. Car ownership in Malta is exceedingly high, considering the very small size of the islands; it is the fourth-highest in the European Union.\r\nMalta has three large natural harbours on its main island: The Grand Harbour (or Port il-Kbir), located at the eastern side of the capital city of Valletta, has been a harbour since Roman times. It has several extensive docks and wharves, as well as a cruise liner terminal. A terminal at the Grand Harbour serves ferries that connect Malta to Pozzallo &amp; Catania in Sicily. Marsamxett Harbour, located on the western side of Valletta, accommodates a number of yacht marinas.\r\nMalta International Airport is the only airport serving the Maltese islands. It is built on the land formerly occupied by the RAF Luqa air base. A heliport is also located there, but the scheduled service to Gozo ceased in 2006. The national airline is Air Malta, which is based at Malta International Airport and operates services to 36 destinations in Europe and North Africa. The owners of Air Malta are the\u00a0Gover\r\nnment of Malta\u00a0(98 per cent) and private investors (2 percent).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>TOURISM<\/strong>\r\nMalta is a popular tourist destination, with 1.6\u00a0million tourists per year.\u00a0Three times more tourists visit than there are residents. Tourism infrastructure has increased dramatically over the years and a number of hotels are present on the island, although overdevelopment and the destruction of traditional housing is of growing concern. An increasing number of Maltese now travel abroad on holiday. In recent years, Malta has advertised itself as a\u00a0medical tourism\u00a0destination,\u00a0and a number of\u00a0health tourism providers\u00a0are developing the industry. However, no Maltese hospital has undergone independent\u00a0international healthcare accreditation.\r\n\r\n<strong>DEMOGRAPHICS <\/strong>\r\nNative\u00a0Maltese people\u00a0make up the majority of the island. However, there are minorities, the largest of which are\u00a0Britons, many of whom are retirees. The population of Malta as of July\u00a02011\u00a0was estimated at 408,000. Malta&#8217;s population density of 1,282 per square km (3,322\/sq\u00a0mi) is by far the highest in the EU and one of the highest in the world.\r\n<strong>Languages <\/strong>\r\nThe Maltese language is one of the two constitutional languages\u00a0of Malta, having become official, however, only in 1934, and being considered as the national language. Previously,\u00a0Sicilian\u00a0was the official and cultural language of Malta from the 12th century, and\u00a0Tuscan dialect\u00a0of\u00a0Italian\u00a0from the 16th century. Alongside Maltese, English is also an official language of the country and hence the laws of the land are enacted both in Maltese and English.\r\nMaltese is a\u00a0Semitic language\u00a0descended from the now defunct Sicilian-Arabic (Siculo-Arabic) dialect (from\u00a0southern Italy) that developed during the\u00a0Emirate of Sicily.\u00a0The\u00a0Maltese alphabet\u00a0consists of 30 letters based on the\u00a0Latin alphabet, including the\u00a0diacritically\u00a0altered letters\u00a0\u017c,\u00a0\u010b\u00a0and\u00a0\u0121, as well as the letters\u00a0g\u0127,\u00a0\u0127, and\u00a0ie.\r\nMaltese has a Semitic base with substantial borrowing from\u00a0Sicilian, Italian, a little French, and more recently and increasingly, English.\u00a0The hybrid character of Maltese was established by a long period of Maltese-Sicilian urban bilingualism gradually transforming rural speech and which ended in the early 19th century with Maltese emerging as the vernacular of the entire native population. The language includes different dialects that can vary greatly from one town to another or from one island to another.\r\n<strong>Religion <\/strong>\r\nCatholic Church\u00a0(84.4%), Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses\u00a0(0.4%),\u00a0Other\u00a0Christian\u00a0(0.8%),\u00a0Only believe in God\u00a0(1.8%),\u00a0Islam\u00a0(2.6%),\u00a0Other religions (1.3%),\u00a0Irreligious\u00a0(8.7%)\r\nThe predominant religion in Malta is\u00a0Catholicism. The second article of the\u00a0Constitution of Malta\u00a0establishes Catholicism as the\u00a0state religion\u00a0and it is also reflected in various elements of\u00a0Maltese culture, although\u00a0entrenched provisions\u00a0for the freedom of religion are made. There are more than 360 churches in Malta, Gozo and Comino, or one church for every 1,000 residents. The parish church is the architectural and geographic focal point of every Maltese town and village, and its main source of civic pride. This civic pride manifests itself in spectacular fashion during the local village\u00a0festas, which mark the day of the patron saint of each parish with marching bands, religious processions, special\u00a0Masses,\u00a0fireworks\u00a0(especially petards) and other festivities.\r\nMalta is an\u00a0Apostolic See; the\u00a0Acts of the Apostles\u00a0tells of how\u00a0St. Paul, on his way from Jerusalem to Rome to face trial, was shipwrecked on the island of &#8220;Melite&#8221;, which many Bible scholars identify with Malta, an episode dated around AD 60.\u00a0As recorded in the Acts of the Apostles, St. Paul spent three months on the island on his way to Rome, curing the sick including the father of Publius, the &#8220;chief man of the island&#8221;. Various traditions are associated with this account. The shipwreck is said to have occurred in the place today known as\u00a0St Paul&#8217;s Bay. The Maltese saint,\u00a0Saint Publius\u00a0is said to have been made Malta&#8217;s first bishop and a grotto in\u00a0Rabat, now known as &#8220;St Paul&#8217;s Grotto&#8221; (and in the vicinity of which evidence of Christian burials and rituals from the 3rd century AD has been found), is among the earliest known places of Christian worship on the island.\r\nFurther evidence of Christian practices and beliefs during the period of Roman persecution appears in catacombs that lie beneath various sites around Malta, including St Paul&#8217;s Catacombs and St Agatha&#8217;s Catacombs in Rabat, just outside the walls of dina. The latter, in particular, were beautifully frescoed between 1200 and 1480, although marauding Turks defaced many of them in the 1550s. There are also a number of cave churches, including the grotto at Mellie\u0127a, which is a Shrine of the Nativity of Our Lady where, according to legend, St. Luke painted a picture of the Madonna. It has been a place of pilgrimage since medieval times.\r\nThere is one Muslim mosque, the Mariam Al-Batool Mosque. A Muslim primary school recently opened. Of the estimated 3,000 Muslims in Malta, approximately 2,250 are foreigners, approximately 600 are naturalised citizens, and approximately 150 are native-born Maltese. Zen Buddhism\u00a0and the\u00a0Bah\u00e1&#8217;\u00ed Faith\u00a0claim some 40 members. Approximately 4.5 per cent of the population of Malta gives no preference to any religious belief. The number of\u00a0Atheists\u00a0has exponentially grown, by doubling from 2014 to 2016.\u00a0Non-religious\u00a0people have a higher risk to suffer from discrimination, such as lack of trust by society and unequal treatment by institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>MIGRATION.\u00a0<\/strong>Most of the foreign community in Malta, predominantly active or retired British nationals and their dependents, is centred on\u00a0Sliema and surrounding modern suburbs. Other smaller foreign groups include Italians, Libyans and Serbians, many of whom have assimilated into the Maltese nation over the decades.\r\nSince the late 20th century, Malta has become a transit country for migration routes from Africa towards Europe. As a member of the European Union and of the Schengen agreement, Malta is bound by the Dublin Regulation to process all claims for asylum by those asylum seekers that enter EU territory for the first time in Malta.\r\nIrregular migrants who land in Malta are subject to a\u00a0compulsory detention policy, being held in several camps organised by the\u00a0Armed Forces of Malta\u00a0(AFM), including those near\u00a0\u0126al Far\u00a0and\u00a0\u0126al Safi. The compulsory detention policy has been denounced by several NGOs, and in July 2010, the\u00a0European Court of Human Rights\u00a0found that Malta&#8217;s detention of migrants was arbitrary, lacking in adequate procedures to challenge detention, and in breach of its.\r\nIn January 2014 Malta started granting citizenship for a \u20ac650,000 contribution plus investments, contingent on residence and criminal background requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>EDUCATION<\/strong>\r\nPrimary schooling has been compulsory since 1946; secondary education up to the age of sixteen was made compulsory in 1971. The state and the\u00a0Church\u00a0provide education free of charge, both running a number of schools in Malta and\u00a0Gozo,\r\nThe\u00a0University of Malta\u00a0(U.o.M.) provides Tertiary education at diploma, undergraduate and postgraduate level. The adult\u00a0literacy rate\u00a0is 99.5 per cent.\r\nMaltese and English are both used to teach pupils at primary and secondary school level, and both languages are also compulsory subjects.\u00a0Public schools\u00a0tend to use both Maltese and English in a balanced manner.\u00a0Most university courses are in English.\r\nMalta is also a popular destination to study the English language, attracting over 80,000 students in 2012.\r\n\r\n<strong>HEALTHCARE<\/strong>\r\nMalta has a long history of providing\u00a0publicly funded health care. The first hospital recorded in the country was already functioning by 1372. Today, Malta has both a public healthcare system, known as the government healthcare service, where healthcare is free at the point of delivery, and a\u00a0private healthcare\u00a0system.\u00a0Malta has a strong general practitioner-delivered primary care base and the public hospitals provide secondary and tertiary care. The Maltese Ministry of Health advises foreign residents to take out private medical insurance.\r\nThe Mater Dei Hospital, Malta&#8217;s primary hospital, opened in 2007. It has one of the largest medical buildings in Europe. The University of Malta has a medical school and a Faculty of Health Sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>CULTURE <\/strong>\r\n<strong>Music.<\/strong> While Maltese music today is largely Western, traditional Maltese music includes what is known as\u00a0g\u0127ana. This consists of background\u00a0folk guitar\u00a0music, while a few people, generally men, take it in turns to argue a point in a sing-song voice. The aim of the lyrics, which are improvised, is to create a friendly yet challenging atmosphere, and it takes a number of years of practice to be able to combine the required artistic qualities with the ability to\u00a0debate\u00a0effectively.\r\n<strong>Architecture.<\/strong> Maltese architecture has been influenced by many different Mediterranean cultures and British architecture over its history. The first settlers on the island constructed\u00a0\u0120gantija, one of the oldest manmade freestanding structures in the world. The Neolithic temple builders 3800\u20132500 BC endowed the numerous temples of Malta and Gozo with intricate bas relief designs, including spirals evocative of the tree of life and animal portraits, designs painted in red ochre, ceramics and a vast collection of human form sculptures, particularly the Venus of Malta. These can be viewed at the temples themselves (most notably, the\u00a0Hypogeum\u00a0and Tarxien Temples), and at the National Museum of Archaeology in\u00a0Valletta.\r\nThe Roman period introduced highly decorative mosaic floors, marble colonnades and classical statuary, remnants of which are beautifully preserved and presented in the Roman Domus, a country villa just outside the walls of\u00a0Mdina. The early Christian frescoes that decorate the\u00a0catacombs\u00a0beneath Malta reveal a propensity for eastern,\u00a0Byzantine\u00a0tastes. These tastes continued to inform the endeavours of\u00a0medieval\u00a0Maltese artists, but they were increasingly influenced by the\u00a0Romanesque\u00a0and\u00a0Southern Gothic\u00a0movements.\r\n<strong>Art.<\/strong> Towards the end of the 15th century, Maltese artists, like their counterparts in neighbouring Sicily, came under the influence of the School of\u00a0Antonello da Messina, which introduced\u00a0Renaissance\u00a0ideals and concepts to the decorative arts in Malta.\r\nThe artistic heritage of Malta blossomed under the\u00a0Knights of St. John, who brought Italian and Flemish\u00a0Mannerist\u00a0painters to decorate their palaces and the churches of these islands, most notably,\u00a0Matteo Perez d&#8217;Aleccio. The arrival in Malta of\u00a0Caravaggio, who painted at least seven works during his 15-month stay on these islands, further revolutionised local art. Two of Caravaggio&#8217;s most notable works,\u00a0The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist\u00a0and\u00a0Saint Jerome Writing, are on display in the\u00a0Oratory\u00a0of the Conventual Church of St. John.\r\n<strong>Cuisine.<\/strong> Maltese cuisine shows strong Sicilian and English influences as well as influences of\u00a0Spanish,\u00a0Maghrebin\u00a0and\u00a0Proven\u00e7al\u00a0cuisines. A number of regional variations, particularly with regards to Gozo, can be noted as well as seasonal variations associated with the seasonal availability of produce and Christian feasts (such as\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lent\">Lent<\/a>, Easter and Christmas). Food has been important historically in the development of a national identity in particular the traditional\u00a0fenkata\u00a0(i.e., the eating of stewed or fried rabbit).\r\n<strong>Customs.<\/strong> A 2010\u00a0Charities Aid Foundation\u00a0study found that the Maltese were the most generous people in the world, with 83% contributing to charity.\r\n<strong>Traditions<\/strong>. Traditional Maltese proverbs reveal a cultural importance of childbearing and fertility: \u201cA childless marriage cannot be a happy one\u201d. This is a belief that Malta shares with many other Mediterranean cultures.\r\nRural Malta shares in common with Mediterranean society a number of superstitions regarding fertility, menstruation and pregnancy, including the avoidance of cemeteries during the months leading up to childbirth, and avoiding the preparation of certain foods during menses.\r\nTraditionally, Maltese newborns were baptised as promptly as possible, should the child die in infancy without receiving this vital Sacrament; and partly because according to Maltese (and Sicilian) folklore an unbaptised child is not yet a Christian, but &#8220;still a Turk&#8221;. On a child&#8217;s first birthday, in a tradition that still survives today, Maltese parents would organise a game known as\u00a0il-qu\u010b\u010bija, where a variety of symbolic objects would be randomly placed around the seated child. These may include a hard-boiled egg, a Bible,\u00a0crucifix\u00a0or\u00a0rosary beads, a book, and so on. Whichever object the child shows most interest in is said to reveal the child&#8217;s path and fortunes in adulthood.\r\nNuptials are usually followed by a lavish and joyous wedding reception, often including several hundred guests.\r\n<strong>Festivals.<\/strong>Local festivals, similar to those in Southern Italy, are commonplace in Malta and Gozo, celebrating weddings, christenings\u00a0and, most prominently,\u00a0saints&#8217; days, honouring the patron saint of the local parish. On saints&#8217; days, the\u00a0festa\u00a0reaches its apex with a\u00a0High Mass featuring a sermon on the life and achievements of the patron saint, after which a\u00a0statue\u00a0of the religious patron is taken around the local streets in solemn procession, with the faithful following in respectful prayer. The atmosphere of religious devotion quickly gives way to several days of celebration and revelry: band processions,\u00a0fireworks, and late-night parties.\r\nCarnival had an important place on the cultural calendar after\u00a0Grand Master\u00a0Piero de Ponte\u00a0introduced it to the islands in 1535. It is held during the week leading up to\u00a0Ash Wednesday, and typically includes masked balls, fancy dress and grotesque mask competitions, lavish late-night parties, a colourful, ticker-tape parade of allegorical\u00a0floats\u00a0presided over by King Carnival.\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Holy_Week_in_Malta\"><strong><em>Holy Week<\/em><\/strong><\/a>\u00a0starts on\u00a0Palm Sunday\u00a0and ends on\u00a0Easter Sunday. Numerous religious traditions, most of them inherited from one generation to the next, are part of the\u00a0paschal\u00a0celebrations in the Maltese Islands, honouring the death and resurrection of Jesus.\r\n<strong><em>Mnarja<\/em><\/strong>, or l-Imnarja is one of the most important dates on the Maltese cultural calendar. Officially, it is a national festival dedicated to the feast of\u00a0Saints\u00a0Peter\u00a0and\u00a0St. Paul. Its roots can be traced back to the pagan\u00a0Roman\u00a0feast of\u00a0Luminaria\u00a0(literally, &#8220;the illumination&#8221;), when torches and bonfires lit up the early summer night of 29 June. \u00a0A national feast since the rule of the\u00a0Knights, Mnarja is a traditional Maltese festival of food, religion and music. However, by 1613 the focus of the festivities had shifted to the Cathedral of\u00a0St. Paul, in\u00a0Mdina, and featured torchlight processions, the firing of 100 petards, horseraces, and races for men, boys and slaves. Modern Mnarja festivals take place in and around the woodlands of\u00a0Buskett, just outside the town of\u00a0Rabat. The farmers&#8217; exhibition is still a seminal part of the Mnarja festivities today. Mnarja today is one of the few occasions when participants may hear traditional Maltese &#8220;g\u0127ana&#8221;.\r\n<strong><em>Isle of MTV<\/em><\/strong> is a one-day music festival produced and broadcast on an annual basis by MTV. The festival has been arranged annually in Malta since 2007, with major pop artists performing each year.\r\nIn 2009 the first New Year&#8217;s Eve street party was organised in Malta, parallel to what major countries in the world organise.\r\n<strong><em>The Malta International Fireworks Festival<\/em><\/strong> is an annual festival that has been arranged in the Grand Harbour of Valletta since 2003. The festival offers fireworks displays of a number of Maltese as well as foreign fireworks factories. The festival is usually held in the last week of April every year.\r\n\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Officially the\u00a0Republic of Malta\u00a0consists of an\u00a0archipelago\u00a0in the\u00a0Mediterranean Sea 80\u00a0km south of Sicily, 284\u00a0km east of\u00a0Tunisia\u00a0and 333\u00a0km north of\u00a0Libya.\u00a0With a population of about 475,000\u00a0over an area of 316\u00a0km2,\u00a0Malta is the\u00a0world&#8217;s tenth smallest\u00a0and\u00a0fifth most densely-populated\u00a0country.
