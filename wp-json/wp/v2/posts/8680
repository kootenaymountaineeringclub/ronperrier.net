Most of them can be climbed in one day from a camp placed at the N end of the lake although several are more conveniently reached from Farnham Creek. The group is bounded on the E by Farnham Creek, on the S by Jumbo Creek, on the W by the terminal forks of Glacier Creek, and on the N by the main stem of Horsethief Creek.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Lake of the Hanging Glaciers is one of the most spec\u00adtacular features in the Interior Ranges. The southern portion of the two-mile length of the lake is covered by a glacier main\u00adtained by avalanches from hanging glaciers on the cliffs to the south. The ice front is approximately 100 feet in height; bergs calve frequently. The lake was discovered shortly after 1900 by Thomas Starbird, the first settler in the Horsethief Valley. In 1911 he visited the lake with his wife and a group of tourists and guides. During the 1920s frequent parties of tourists were taken to the lake, but nowadays it is seldom visited by any but climbers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Starbird Glacier, the source of Horsethief Creek, is the most extensive in the region. Of more importance to climbers, how\u00adever, are the other major glaciers, Commander Glacier, the chief source of Farnham Creek, and the Jumbo Neve and glaciers which feed the Lake of the Hanging Glaciers. These two systems are joined by a glacial saddle (10600) immediately S of Commander Mountain. All the glaciers in the area have retreated markedly from their positions in the early 1900s when they were first visited. However, measurements of the Commander Glacier show that it advanced 800&#8242; between 1954 and 1960. In recent years, it, too, has been retreating again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>ACCESS <\/strong>(1976). The good road extending W from Radium up the valley of Horsethief Creek provides the principal access to this group, as well as to the Farnham Group to the E. The road terminates about 2 mi beyond the confluence of Farnham Creek as the result of a massive washout. A trail continues 3\u00bd mi up the valley, fording Hellroar Creek and then Horsethief Creek (difficult on foot) shortly below the junction of the outlet stream from Lake of the Hanging Glaciers. Here was located &#8220;Thunder Camp,&#8221; the 1928 ACC summer camp. A short dis\u00adtance upstream, Horsethief Creek is crossed on a log bridge (useable in 1976) or by a difficult and dangerous ford. Once across, work back downstream (trail indistinct in swamps), crossing several channels of the outlet stream to pick up the horse trail again. This good trail winds steeply (26 switchbacks) up the E bank of the outlet stream to meadows at timberline (7000) at the foot of the lake, about 6 mi and 2400&#8242; elevation gain from the end of the road (4 hr). Peaks on the rim of Commander Glacier are more readily climbed from a camp near the forks of Farnham Creek (see Farnham Group), while the isolated Egyptian Peaks in the SW part of the group are best approached by way of the road on Jumbo Creek.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">To reach the Jumbo snowfield from Lake of the Hanging Glaciers, circle the lake on the E and ascend rocks to bench glacier 1000&#8242; above the lake. Traverse S into the basin below Commander-Maye col, thus bypassing the lower icefall. As\u00adcend the middle icefall, working from left to right, and then climb the more difficult and dangerous final icefall to the neve (slopes up to 50\u00b0). About 5 hr, depending greatly on conditions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Loose rocks fall from Commander Mt upon occasion. Although the glacial recession has made this route considerably more difficult since it was first descended in 1928 by Cromwell, Hillhouse and Thorington, with Conrad Kain, its use much enhances the interest of ascents of Jumbo and Kar\u00adnak, which are dull plods when approached over Commander Glacier. The most straightforward, if not technically the easiest way to go from Lake of the Hanging Glaciers to Farnham Creek, and vice-versa, is to cross the Commander-Maye sad\u00addle; about 7 hr in either direction.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Map:<\/strong> 82K\/7E.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em><strong>UNNAMED B<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0 \u00a03002m\u00a0 \u00a09850&#8242;<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>Double summit at N end of divide between Lake of the Hanging Glaciers and Farnham Creek.<br \/>\n<\/em>From Lake of the Hanging Glaciers, follow up the prominent valley to NE to col (9500) between objective and Granite Peak (3\u00bd hr) and reach the summit along S ridge in \u00bc hr more.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>FRA A.
