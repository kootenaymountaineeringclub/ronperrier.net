It is bordered by\u00a0Romania\u00a0to the north,\u00a0Serbia\u00a0and\u00a0North Macedonia\u00a0to the west,\u00a0Greece\u00a0and\u00a0Turkey\u00a0to the south, and the\u00a0Black Sea\u00a0to the east. The capital and largest city is\u00a0Sofia; other major cities are\u00a0Plovdiv,\u00a0Varna\u00a0and\u00a0Burgas. With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres (42,855\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), Bulgaria is Europe&#8217;s\u00a016th-largest country.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Summary.<\/strong> One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the\u00a0Neolithic\u00a0Karanovo culture, which dates back to 6,500 BC. In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for\u00a0Thracians,\u00a0Persians,\u00a0Celts\u00a0and\u00a0ancient Macedonians; stability came when the\u00a0Roman Empire\u00a0conquered the region in AD 45. The Eastern Roman, or Byzantine, Empire lost some of these territories to an invading\u00a0Bulgar\u00a0horde in the late 7th century. The Bulgars founded the\u00a0First Bulgarian Empire\u00a0in AD 681, which dominated most of the\u00a0Balkans\u00a0and significantly influenced\u00a0Slavic\u00a0cultures by developing the\u00a0Cyrillic script. This state lasted until the early 11th century, when Byzantine emperor\u00a0Basil II\u00a0conquered and dismantled it. A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a\u00a0Second Bulgarian Empire, which reached its apex under\u00a0Ivan Asen II\u00a0(1218\u20131241). After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife, the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under\u00a0Ottoman\u00a0rule for nearly five centuries.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u201378\u00a0resulted in the formation of the current Third Bulgarian State. Many ethnic Bulgarian populations were left outside its borders, which led to several conflicts with its neighbours and an alliance with Germany in both world wars. In 1946 Bulgaria became a\u00a0one-party socialist state\u00a0and part of the Soviet-led\u00a0Eastern Bloc. The ruling\u00a0Communist Party\u00a0gave up its monopoly on power after the\u00a0revolutions of 1989\u00a0and allowed\u00a0multi-party\u00a0elections. Bulgaria then transitioned into a\u00a0democracy\u00a0and a market-based economy.<br \/>\nSince adopting a democratic constitution in 1991, the\u00a0sovereign state\u00a0has been a\u00a0unitary\u00a0parliamentary republic\u00a0with a high degree of political, administrative, and economic centralisation. The population of seven million lives mainly in Sofia and the capital cities of the\u00a027 provinces, and the country has suffered significant demographic decline since the late 1980s.<br \/>\nBulgaria is a member of the\u00a0European Union,\u00a0NATO, and the\u00a0Council of Europe; it is a founding state of the\u00a0Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe\u00a0(OSCE) and has taken a seat on the\u00a0UN Security Council\u00a0three times. Its\u00a0market economy\u00a0is part of the\u00a0European Single Market\u00a0and mostly relies on services, followed by industry\u2014especially machine building and mining\u2014and agriculture.\u00a0Widespread corruption\u00a0is a major socioeconomic issue; it ranked as the most corrupt country in the European Union for 2018.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Etymology. <\/strong>The name\u00a0Bulgaria\u00a0is derived from the\u00a0Bulgars, a tribe of\u00a0Turkic\u00a0origin that founded the country. Their name is not completely understood and difficult to trace back earlier than the 4th century AD, but it is possibly derived from the\u00a0Proto-Turkic\u00a0word\u00a0bul\u0123ha(&#8220;to mix&#8221;, &#8220;shake&#8221;, &#8220;stir&#8221;) and its derivative\u00a0bulgak\u00a0(&#8220;revolt&#8221;, &#8220;disorder&#8221;).\u00a0The meaning may be further extended to &#8220;rebel&#8221;, &#8220;incite&#8221; or &#8220;produce a state of disorder&#8221;, i.e. the &#8220;disturbers&#8221;. Ethnic groups in\u00a0Inner Asia\u00a0with phonologically similar names were frequently described in similar terms: during the 4th century, the\u00a0Buluoji, a component of the &#8220;Five Barbarian&#8221; groups in Ancient China, were portrayed as both a &#8220;mixed race&#8221; and &#8220;troublemakers&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HISTORY<br \/>\nPrehistory and antiquity<\/strong>. Neanderthal\u00a0remains dating to around 150,000 years ago, or the\u00a0Middle Paleolithic, are some of the earliest traces of human activity in the lands of modern Bulgaria.\u00a0The\u00a0Karanovo culture\u00a0arose circa 6,500 BC and was one of several\u00a0Neolithic\u00a0societies in the region that thrived on\u00a0agriculture. The\u00a0Copper Age\u00a0Varna culture\u00a0(fifth millennium BC) is credited with inventing\u00a0gold metallurgy. The associated\u00a0Varna Necropolis treasure\u00a0contains the oldest golden jewelry in the world with an approximate age of over 6,000 years.\u00a0The treasure has been valuable for understanding social hierarchy and stratification in the earliest European societies.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Thracians, one of the three primary ancestral groups of modern\u00a0Bulgarians, appeared on the\u00a0Balkan Peninsula\u00a0some time before the 12th century BC.\u00a0The Thracians excelled in\u00a0metallurgy\u00a0and gave the\u00a0Greeks\u00a0the\u00a0Orphean\u00a0and\u00a0Dionysian\u00a0cults, but remained tribal and stateless.\u00a0The Persian\u00a0Achaemenid Empire\u00a0conquered most of present-day Bulgaria in the 6th century BC and retained control over the region until\u00a0479 BC. The invasion became a catalyst for Thracian unity, and the bulk of their tribes united under king\u00a0Teres\u00a0to form the\u00a0Odrysian kingdom\u00a0in the 470s BC.\u00a0It was weakened and vassalized by\u00a0Philip II of Macedon\u00a0in 341 BC,\u00a0attacked\u00a0by Celts\u00a0in the 3rd century, and finally\u00a0became a province\u00a0of the\u00a0Roman Empire\u00a0in AD 45.<br \/>\nBy the end of the 1st century AD, Roman governance was established over the entire Balkan Peninsula and\u00a0Christianity\u00a0began spreading in the region around the 4th century.\u00a0The\u00a0Gothic Bible\u2014the first\u00a0Germanic language\u00a0book\u2014was created by\u00a0Gothic\u00a0bishop\u00a0Ulfilas\u00a0in what is today northern Bulgaria around 381.\u00a0The region came under\u00a0Byzantine\u00a0control after the\u00a0fall of Rome\u00a0in 476. The Byzantines were engaged in prolonged warfare against Persia and could not defend their Balkan territories from barbarian incursions.\u00a0This enabled the\u00a0Slavs\u00a0to enter the Balkan Peninsula as marauders, primarily through an area between the Danube River and the Balkan Mountains known as\u00a0Moesia.\u00a0Gradually, the interior of the peninsula became a country of the\u00a0South Slavs, who lived under a\u00a0democracy. The Slavs assimilated the partially\u00a0Hellenized,\u00a0Romanized, and\u00a0Gothicized\u00a0Thracians in the rural areas.<br \/>\n<strong>First Bulgarian Empire. <\/strong>Not long after the Slavic incursion,\u00a0Moesia\u00a0was once again invaded, this time by the\u00a0Bulgars\u00a0under\u00a0Khan\u00a0Asparukh.\u00a0Their horde was a remnant of\u00a0Old Great Bulgaria, an extinct tribal confederacy situated north of the Black Sea in what is now Ukraine. Asparukh attacked Byzantine territories in Moesia and conquered the Slavic tribes there in 680.\u00a0A peace treaty with the\u00a0Byzantine Empire\u00a0was signed in 681, marking the foundation of the\u00a0First Bulgarian Empire. The minority Bulgars formed a close-knit ruling caste.Succeeding rulers strengthened the Bulgarian state throughout the 8th and 9th centuries.\u00a0Krum\u00a0introduced a written code of law\u00a0and checked a major Byzantine incursion at the\u00a0Battle of Pliska, in which Byzantine emperor\u00a0Nicephorus I\u00a0was killed.\u00a0Boris I\u00a0abolished paganism in favour of\u00a0Eastern Orthodox Christianity\u00a0in 864. The\u00a0conversion\u00a0was followed by a Byzantine recognition of the\u00a0Bulgarian church\u00a0and the adoption of the\u00a0Cyrillic alphabet, developed in the capital,\u00a0Preslav. The common language, religion and script strengthened central authority and gradually fused the Slavs and Bulgars into a unified people speaking a single\u00a0Slavic language.\u00a0A golden age began during the 34-year rule of\u00a0Simeon the Great, who oversaw the largest territorial expansion of the state.<br \/>\nAfter Simeon&#8217;s death, Bulgaria was weakened by wars with\u00a0Magyars\u00a0and\u00a0Pechenegs\u00a0and the spread of the\u00a0Bogomil heresy.\u00a0Preslav was seized by the Byzantine army in 971 after consecutive\u00a0Rus&#8217;\u00a0and Byzantine invasions.\u00a0The empire briefly recovered from the attacks under\u00a0Samuil,\u00a0but this ended when Byzantine emperor\u00a0Basil II\u00a0defeated the Bulgarian army at\u00a0Klyuch\u00a0in 1014. Samuil died shortly after the battle,\u00a0and by 1018 the Byzantines\u00a0had conquered the First Bulgarian Empire.<br \/>\n<strong>Second Bulgarian Empire. <\/strong>After the conquest of Bulgaria, Basil II prevented revolts by retaining the rule of local nobility and relieving their lands of the obligation to pay taxes in gold, allowing\u00a0tax in kind instead. The\u00a0Bulgarian Patriarchate\u00a0was reduced to an\u00a0archbishopric, but retained its\u00a0autocephalous status\u00a0and its\u00a0dioceses.\u00a0Byzantine domestic policies changed after Basil&#8217;s death and a series of unsuccessful rebellions broke out,\u00a0the largest\u00a0being led by\u00a0Peter Delyan. In 1185\u00a0Asen dynasty\u00a0nobles\u00a0Ivan Asen I\u00a0and\u00a0Peter IV\u00a0organized a\u00a0major uprising\u00a0which resulted in the re-establishment of the Bulgarian state. Ivan Asen and Peter laid the foundations of the Second Bulgarian Empire with\u00a0Tarnovo\u00a0as the capital.<br \/>\nKaloyan, the third of the Asen monarchs, extended his dominion to\u00a0Belgrade\u00a0and\u00a0Ohrid. He acknowledged the spiritual supremacy of\u00a0the pope\u00a0and received a royal crown from a\u00a0papal legate.\u00a0The empire reached its zenith under\u00a0Ivan Asen II\u00a0(1218\u20131241), when its borders expanded as far as the coast of\u00a0Albania, Serbia and\u00a0Epirus, while commerce and culture flourished.\u00a0Ivan Asen&#8217;s rule was also marked by a shift away from Rome in religious matters.<br \/>\nThe Asen dynasty became extinct in 1257. Internal conflicts and incessant Byzantine and Hungarian attacks followed, enabling the\u00a0Mongols\u00a0to\u00a0establish suzerainty\u00a0over the weakened Bulgarian state.\u00a0In 1277, swineherd\u00a0Ivaylo\u00a0led a\u00a0great peasant revolt\u00a0that chased the Mongols out of Bulgaria and briefly made him emperor. He was overthrown in 1280 by\u00a0the feudal landlords,\u00a0whose factional conflicts caused the Second Bulgarian Empire to disintegrate into small feudal dominions by the 14th century.\u00a0These fragmented\u00a0rump states\u2014two tsardoms at\u00a0Vidin\u00a0and\u00a0Tarnovo\u00a0and the\u00a0Despotate of Dobrudzha\u2014became easy prey for a new threat arriving from the Southeast: the\u00a0Ottoman Turks.<br \/>\n<strong>Ottoman rule. <\/strong>The Ottomans were employed as mercenaries by the Byzantines in the 1340s but later became invaders in their own right.\u00a0Sultan\u00a0Murad I\u00a0took\u00a0Adrianople\u00a0from the Byzantines in 1362;\u00a0Sofia\u00a0fell in 1382, followed by\u00a0Shumen\u00a0in 1388.\u00a0The Ottomans completed their conquest of Bulgarian lands in 1393 when Tarnovo was sacked after a three-month siege and the\u00a0Battle of Nicopolis\u00a0which brought about the fall of the Vidin Tsardom in 1396.\u00a0Sozopol\u00a0was the last Bulgarian settlement to fall, in 1453.\u00a0The Bulgarian nobility was subsequently eliminated and the peasantry was\u00a0enserfed\u00a0to Ottoman masters,\u00a0while much of the educated clergy fled to other countries.<br \/>\nChristians\u00a0were considered an\u00a0inferior class\u00a0of people under the Ottoman system. Bulgarians were subjected to heavy taxes (including\u00a0devshirme, or\u00a0blood tax), their culture was suppressed,\u00a0and they experienced partial\u00a0Islamisation.\u00a0Ottoman authorities established a religious administrative community called the\u00a0Rum Millet, which governed all Orthodox Christians regardless of their ethnicity.\u00a0Most of the local population then gradually lost its distinct national consciousness, identifying only by its faith.\u00a0The clergy remaining in some isolated monasteries kept their ethnic identity alive, enabling its survival in remote rural areas,\u00a0and in the militant\u00a0Catholic community\u00a0in the northwest of the country.<br \/>\nAs Ottoman power began to wane,\u00a0Habsburg Austria\u00a0and Russia saw Bulgarian Christians as potential allies. The\u00a0Austrians\u00a0first backed an\u00a0uprising in Tarnovo in 1598, then\u00a0a second one in 1686, the\u00a0Chiprovtsi Uprising\u00a0in 1688 and finally\u00a0Karposh&#8217;s Rebellion\u00a0in 1689.\u00a0The\u00a0Russian Empire\u00a0also asserted itself as a protector of Christians in Ottoman lands with the\u00a0Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca\u00a0in 1774.<br \/>\nThe Western European\u00a0Enlightenment\u00a0in the 18th century influenced the initiation of a\u00a0national awakening of Bulgaria.\u00a0It restored national consciousness and provided an ideological basis for the liberation struggle, resulting in the 1876\u00a0April Uprising. Up to 30,000 Bulgarians were killed as Ottoman authorities put down the rebellion. The massacres prompted the\u00a0Great Powers\u00a0to take action.\u00a0They convened the\u00a0Constantinople Conference\u00a0in 1876, but their decisions were rejected by the Ottomans. This allowed the\u00a0Russian Empire\u00a0to seek a military solution without risking confrontation with other Great Powers, as had happened in the\u00a0Crimean War.\u00a0In 1877\u00a0Russia declared war\u00a0on the Ottomans and defeated them with the help of\u00a0Bulgarian rebels, particularly during the crucial\u00a0Battle of Shipka Pass which secured Russian control over the main road to\u00a0Constantinople.<br \/>\n<strong>Third Bulgarian state. <\/strong>The\u00a0Treaty of San Stefano\u00a0was signed on 3 March 1878 by\u00a0Russia\u00a0and the\u00a0Ottoman Empire. It was to set up an autonomous Bulgarian principality spanning\u00a0Moesia,\u00a0Macedonia\u00a0and\u00a0Thrace, roughly on the territories of the\u00a0Second Bulgarian Empire,\u00a0and this day is now\u00a0a public holiday\u00a0called National Liberation Day.\u00a0The other\u00a0Great Powers\u00a0immediately rejected the treaty out of fear that such a large country in the\u00a0Balkans\u00a0might threaten their interests. It was superseded by the\u00a0Treaty of Berlin, signed on 13 July, which provided for a much smaller state only comprising Moesia and the region of\u00a0Sofia, leaving large populations of ethnic Bulgarians outside the new country.\u00a0This significantly contributed to Bulgaria&#8217;s militaristic foreign affairs approach during the first half of the 20th century.<br \/>\nThe Bulgarian principality won\u00a0a war against Serbia\u00a0and incorporated the semi-autonomous Ottoman territory of\u00a0Eastern Rumelia\u00a0in 1885, proclaiming itself an independent state on 5 October 1908.\u00a0In the years following independence, Bulgaria increasingly militarized and was often referred to as &#8220;the Balkan\u00a0Prussia&#8221;.\u00a0It became involved in three consecutive conflicts between 1912 and 1918\u2014two\u00a0Balkan Wars\u00a0and\u00a0World War I. After a disastrous defeat in the\u00a0Second Balkan War, Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side as a result of its alliance with the\u00a0Central Powers\u00a0in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army\u00a0and achieving several decisive victories at\u00a0Doiran\u00a0and\u00a0Monastir, the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed.\u00a0More than 253,000 refugees from the lost territories\u00a0immigrated\u00a0to Bulgaria from 1912 to 1929,\u00a0placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy.<br \/>\nThe resulting political unrest led to the establishment of a royal\u00a0authoritarian dictatorship\u00a0by Tsar\u00a0Boris III\u00a0(1918\u20131943). Bulgaria entered World War II in 1941 as a member of\u00a0the Axis\u00a0but declined to participate in\u00a0Operation Barbarossa\u00a0and\u00a0saved its Jewish population\u00a0from deportation to\u00a0concentration camps. The sudden death of Boris III in mid-1943 pushed the country into political turmoil as the war turned against Germany, and the communist guerrilla movement gained momentum. The government of\u00a0Bogdan Filov\u00a0subsequently failed to achieve peace with the Allies. Bulgaria did not comply with Soviet demands to expel German forces from its territory, resulting in a declaration of war and an invasion by the USSR in September 1944.\u00a0The communist-dominated\u00a0Fatherland Front\u00a0took power, ended participation in the Axis and joined the Allied side until the war ended.\u00a0Bulgaria suffered little war damage and the Soviet Union demanded no reparations. But all wartime gains, with the notable exception of\u00a0Southern Dobrudzha, were lost.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0left-wing uprising\u00a0of 9 September 1944 led to the abolition of the monarchy and\u00a0the executions\u00a0of some 1,000\u20133,000 dissidents, war criminals, and members of the former royal elite.\u00a0But it was not until 1946 that a\u00a0one-party\u00a0people&#8217;s republic\u00a0was instituted following a referendum. It fell into the Soviet sphere of influence under the leadership of\u00a0Georgi Dimitrov\u00a0(1946\u20131949), who established a repressive, rapidly industrializing\u00a0Stalinist\u00a0state.\u00a0By the mid-1950s standards of living rose significantly and political repressions eased. The Soviet-style\u00a0planned economy\u00a0saw some market-oriented policies emerging on an experimental level under\u00a0Todor Zhivkov\u00a0(1954\u20131989).\u00a0Compared to wartime levels, national GDP increased five-fold and per capita GDP quadrupled by the 1980s,\u00a0although severe debt spikes took place in 1960, 1977 and 1980.\u00a0Zhivkov&#8217;s daughter\u00a0Lyudmila\u00a0bolstered national pride by promoting Bulgarian heritage, culture and arts worldwide.\u00a0Facing declining birth rates among the ethnic Bulgarian majority, in 1984 Zhivkov&#8217;s government forced the minority ethnic\u00a0Turks\u00a0to adopt Slavic names in an attempt to erase their identity and assimilate them.\u00a0These policies resulted in the emigration of some 300,000 ethnic Turks to Turkey.<br \/>\nThe Communist Party was forced to give up its political monopoly on 10 November 1989 under the influence of the\u00a0Revolutions of 1989. Zhivkov resigned and Bulgaria embarked on a transition to a parliamentary democracy.\u00a0The first free elections in June 1990 were won by the Communist Party, now rebranded as the\u00a0Bulgarian Socialist Party.\u00a0A\u00a0new constitution\u00a0that provided for a relatively weak elected president and for a prime minister accountable to the legislature was adopted in July 1991.\u00a0The new system initially failed to improve living standards or create economic growth\u2014the average quality of life and economic performance remained lower than under communism well into the early 2000s.\u00a0After 2001 economic, political and geopolitical conditions improved greatly,\u00a0and Bulgaria achieved high Human Development status in 2003.\u00a0It became a member of\u00a0NATO\u00a0in 2004\u00a0and participated in the\u00a0War in Afghanistan. After several years of reforms it joined the\u00a0European Union\u00a0and\u00a0single market\u00a0in 2007 despite Brussels&#8217; concerns about government corruption.\u00a0Bulgaria hosted the 2018\u00a0Presidency of the Council of the European Union\u00a0at the National Palace of Culture in Sofia.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GEOGRAPHY<br \/>\n<\/strong>Bulgaria occupies a portion of the eastern\u00a0Balkan\u00a0peninsula, bordering five countries\u2014Greece\u00a0and\u00a0Turkey\u00a0to the south,\u00a0Macedonia\u00a0and\u00a0Serbia\u00a0to the west, and\u00a0Romania\u00a0to the north.

The mountainous southwest has two distinct alpine ranges\u2014Rila\u00a0and\u00a0Pirin, which border the lower but more extensive\u00a0Rhodope Mountains\u00a0to the east.\u00a0Musala, at 2,925 metres (9,596\u00a0ft), is the highest point in both Bulgaria and the Balkan peninsula, and the Black Sea coast is the country&#8217;s lowest point. Plains occupy about one third of the territory, while plateaux and hills occupy 41%. Most rivers are short and with low water levels. The longest river located solely in Bulgarian territory, the\u00a0Iskar, has a length of 368 kilometres (229\u00a0mi). Other major rivers include the\u00a0Struma\u00a0and the\u00a0Maritsa\u00a0in the south.<br \/>\n<strong>Climate.<\/strong> Bulgaria has a changeable climate, which results from being positioned at the meeting point of the\u00a0Mediterranean\u00a0and continental air masses combined with the barrier effect of its mountains. Northern Bulgaria averages 1\u00a0\u00b0C (1.8\u00a0\u00b0F) cooler, and registers 200 millimetres (7.9\u00a0in) more precipitation, than the regions south of the Balkan mountains. Temperature amplitudes vary significantly in different areas. The lowest recorded temperature is \u221238.3\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221236.9\u00a0\u00b0F), while the highest is 45.2\u00a0\u00b0C (113.4\u00a0\u00b0F).\u00a0Precipitation averages about 630 mm (24.8\u00a0in) per year, and varies from 500 mm (19.7\u00a0in) in\u00a0Dobrudja\u00a0to more than 2,500 mm (98.4\u00a0in) in the mountains. Continental air masses bring significant amounts of snowfall during winter.<br \/>\n<strong>Biodiversity and environment<\/strong>. The interaction of climatic, hydrological, geological and topographical conditions has produced a relatively wide variety of plant and animal species. Bulgaria&#8217;s\u00a0biodiversity, one of the richest in Europe,\u00a0is conserved\u00a0in three national parks, 11 nature parks, 10\u00a0biosphere reserves\u00a0and 565 protected areas.\u00a0Ninety-three of the 233\u00a0mammal\u00a0species of Europe are found in Bulgaria, along with 49% of\u00a0butterfly\u00a0and 30% of\u00a0vascular plant\u00a0species.\u00a0Overall, 41,493 plant and animal species are present.\u00a0Larger mammals with sizable populations include\u00a0deer\u00a0(106,323),\u00a0wild boars\u00a0(88,948),\u00a0jackals\u00a0(47,293) and\u00a0foxes\u00a0(32,326).\u00a0Partridges\u00a0number some 328,000, making them the most widespread\u00a0gamebird.\u00a0A third of all nesting birds in Bulgaria can be found in\u00a0Rila National Park, which also hosts Arctic and alpine species at high altitudes.\u00a0Flora includes more than 3,800 vascular plant species of which 170 are\u00a0endemic\u00a0and 150 are considered endangered. A checklist of larger\u00a0fungi\u00a0in Bulgaria by the Institute of Botany identifies more than 1,500 species.\u00a0More than 35% of the land area is covered by forests.<br \/>\nIn 1998, the Bulgarian government adopted the National Biological Diversity Conservation Strategy, a comprehensive programe seeking the preservation of local ecosystems, protection of endangered species and conservation of genetic resources.\u00a0Bulgaria has some of the largest\u00a0Natura 2000\u00a0areas in Europe covering 33.8% of its territory.\u00a0It also achieved its\u00a0Kyoto Protocol\u00a0objective of reducing\u00a0carbon dioxide emissions\u00a0by 30% from 1990 to 2009.<br \/>\nBulgaria ranks 30th in the 2018\u00a0Environmental Performance Index, but scores low on air quality.\u00a0Particulate\u00a0levels are the highest in Europe,\u00a0especially in urban areas affected by automobile traffic and coal-based power stations.\u00a0One of these, the\u00a0lignite-fired\u00a0Maritsa Iztok-2\u00a0station, is causing the highest damage to health and the environment in the European Union.\u00a0Pesticide use in agriculture and antiquated industrial sewage systems produce extensive soil and water pollution.\u00a0Water quality began to improve in 1998 and has maintained a trend of moderate improvement. Over 75% of surface rivers meet European standards for good quality.<\/p>\n<p><strong>POLITICS<br \/>\n<\/strong>Bulgaria is a\u00a0parliamentary democracy\u00a0where the\u00a0prime minister\u00a0is the\u00a0head of government\u00a0and the most powerful executive position. The political system has three branches\u2014legislative, executive and judicial, with\u00a0universal suffrage\u00a0for\u00a0citizens\u00a0at least 18 years old. The\u00a0Constitution\u00a0also provides possibilities of direct democracy, namely petitions and national\u00a0referenda.\u00a0Normally, the prime minister-elect is the leader of the party receiving the most votes in parliamentary elections, although this is not always the case.<br \/>\nUnlike the prime minister, presidential domestic power is more limited. The directly elected\u00a0president\u00a0serves as\u00a0head of state\u00a0and\u00a0commander-in-chief\u00a0of the armed forces, and has the authority to return a bill for further debate, although the parliament can override the\u00a0presidential veto\u00a0by a simple majority vote.\u00a0Political parties gather in the\u00a0National Assembly, a body of 240 deputies elected to four-year terms by direct popular vote. The National Assembly has the power to enact laws, approve the budget, schedule presidential elections, select and dismiss the prime minister and other ministers, declare war, deploy troops abroad, and ratify international treaties and agreements.<br \/>\nOverall, Bulgaria displays a pattern of unstable governments.\u00a0Boyko Borisov\u00a0is serving his third term as prime minister since 2009,\u00a0when his centre-right, pro-EU party\u00a0GERB\u00a0won\u00a0the general election\u00a0and ruled as a\u00a0minority government\u00a0with 117 seats in the National Assembly.\u00a0His first government resigned on 20 February 2013 after\u00a0nationwide protests\u00a0caused by high costs of utilities, low living standards, corruption\u00a0and the perceived failure of the democratic system. The protest wave was notable for self-immolations, spontaneous demonstrations and a strong sentiment against political parties.<br \/>\nThe subsequent\u00a0snap elections in May\u00a0resulted in a narrow win for\u00a0GERB,\u00a0but the\u00a0Bulgarian Socialist Party\u00a0eventually formed a government led by\u00a0Plamen Oresharski\u00a0after Borisov failed to secure parliamentary support.\u00a0The Oresharski government resigned in July 2014 amid continuing\u00a0large-scale protests.\u00a0A caretaker government took over\u00a0and called the\u00a0October 2014 elections\u00a0which resulted in a third GERB victory, but a total of eight parties entered parliament. Borisov\u00a0formed a coalition\u00a0with several right-wing parties, but resigned again after the candidate backed by his party failed to win the\u00a02016 Presidential election. The\u00a0March 2017 snap election\u00a0was again won by GERB, but with 95 seats in Parliament. They formed a coalition with the far-right\u00a0United Patriots, who hold 27 seats.<br \/>\nFreedom House\u00a0has reported a continuing deterioration of democratic governance after 2009, citing reduced media independence, stalled reforms, abuse of authority at the highest level and increased dependence of local administrations on the central government.\u00a0Bulgaria is still\u00a0listed as &#8220;Free&#8221;, with a political system designated as a semi-consolidated democracy, albeit with deteriorating scores.\u00a0The\u00a0Democracy Index\u00a0defines it as a &#8220;Flawed democracy&#8221;.<br \/>\n<strong>Foreign relations and security.<\/strong> Bulgaria became a member of the\u00a0United Nations\u00a0in 1955 and since 1966 has been a non-permanent member of the\u00a0Security Council\u00a0three times, most recently from 2002 to 2003.\u00a0It was also among the founding nations of the\u00a0Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe\u00a0(OSCE) in 1975. Euro-Atlantic integration has been a priority since the fall of communism, although the communist leadership also had aspirations of leaving the Warsaw Pact and joining the\u00a0European Communities\u00a0by 1987.\u00a0Bulgaria signed the European Union\u00a0Treaty of Accession\u00a0on 25 April 2005,\u00a0and became a full member of the European Union on 1 January 2007.\u00a0In addition, it has a tripartite economic and diplomatic collaboration with Romania and Greece,\u00a0good ties with China\u00a0and\u00a0Vietnam\u00a0and a historical relationship with\u00a0Russia.<br \/>\nBulgaria deployed significant numbers of both civilian and military advisors in Soviet-allied countries like\u00a0Nicaragua\u00a0and\u00a0Libya\u00a0during the\u00a0Cold War.\u00a0The first deployment of foreign troops on Bulgarian soil since World War II occurred in 2001, when the country hosted six\u00a0KC-135 Stratotanker\u00a0aircraft and 200 support personnel for the war effort in Afghanistan.\u00a0International military relations were further expanded with accession to\u00a0NATO\u00a0in March 2004\u00a0and the US-Bulgarian Defence Cooperation Agreement signed in April 2006.\u00a0Bezmer\u00a0and\u00a0Graf Ignatievo\u00a0air bases, the\u00a0Novo Selo\u00a0training range, and a logistics centre in\u00a0Aytos\u00a0subsequently became\u00a0joint military training facilities\u00a0cooperatively used by the United States and Bulgarian militaries.<br \/>\nDomestic defence is the responsibility of the all-volunteer\u00a0Bulgarian armed forces, composed of\u00a0land forces,\u00a0navy\u00a0and an\u00a0air force. The land forces consist of two mechanized brigades and eight independent regiments and battalions; the air force operates 106 aircraft and air defence systems in six air bases, and the navy operates various ships, helicopters and coastal defence weapons.\u00a0Active troops dwindled from 152,000 in 1988\u00a0to 31,300 in 2017, supplemented by 3,000 reservists and 16,000 paramilitary.\u00a0The inventory consists mostly of Soviet equipment like\u00a0Mikoyan MiG-29\u00a0and\u00a0Sukhoi Su-25\u00a0jets,\u00a0S-300PT\u00a0air defence systems and\u00a0SS-21 Scarab\u00a0short-range\u00a0ballistic missiles.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ECONOMY<br \/>\n<\/strong>Bulgaria has an open,\u00a0upper middle income\u00a0range\u00a0market economy\u00a0where the private sector accounts for more than 70% of GDP.\u00a0From a largely agricultural country with a predominantly rural population in 1948, by the 1980s Bulgaria had transformed into an industrial economy with scientific and technological research at the top of its budgetary expenditure priorities.\u00a0The loss of\u00a0COMECON\u00a0markets in 1990 and the subsequent &#8220;shock therapy&#8221; of the planned system caused a steep decline in industrial and agricultural production, ultimately followed by an economic collapse in 1997. The economy largely recovered during a period of rapid growth several years later,\u00a0but the average salary of 1,036 leva ($615) per month remains the lowest in the EU. More than a fifth of the labour force are employed on a\u00a0minimum wage\u00a0of $1.16 per hour.<br \/>\nA\u00a0balanced budget\u00a0was achieved in 2003 and the country began running a\u00a0surplus\u00a0the following year. Expenditures amounted to $21.15 billion and revenues were $21.67 billion in 2017.\u00a0Most government spending on institutions is earmarked for security. The ministries of defence, the interior and justice are allocated the largest share of the annual government budget, whereas those responsible for the environment, tourism and energy receive the least amount of funding.\u00a0Taxes form the bulk of government revenue\u00a0at 30% of GDP.\u00a0Bulgaria has some of the lowest corporate income\u00a0tax rates in the EU\u00a0at a flat 10% rate.\u00a0The tax system is two-tier.\u00a0Value added tax,\u00a0excise duties, corporate and personal income tax are national, whereas real estate, inheritance, and vehicle taxes are levied by local authorities.\u00a0Strong economic performance in the early 2000s reduced\u00a0government debt\u00a0from 79.6% in 1998 to 14.1% in 2008.\u00a0It has since increased to 28.7% of GDP by 2016, but remains the third lowest in the EU.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Yugozapaden\u00a0planning area\u00a0is the most developed region with a\u00a0per capita\u00a0gross domestic product (PPP) of $26,580 in 2016.\u00a0It includes the capital city and the surrounding\u00a0Sofia Province, which alone generate 42% of national gross domestic product despite hosting only 22% of the population.\u00a0PPP\u00a0GDP\u00a0per capita and the cost of living in 2017 stood at 49 and 48.4% of the EU average, respectively.\u00a0National PPP GDP was estimated at $143.1\u00a0billion in 2016, with a per capita value of $20,116. Economic growth statistics take into account illegal transactions from the\u00a0informal economy, which is the largest in the EU as a percentage of economic output.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Bulgarian National Bank\u00a0issues the national currency,\u00a0lev, which is pegged to the euro at a rate of 1.95583 lev\u0430 per euro.<br \/>\nAfter several consecutive years of high growth, repercussions of the\u00a0financial crisis of 2007\u20132008\u00a0resulted in a 3.6% contraction of GDP in 2009 and increased unemployment.\u00a0Industrial output declined 10%, mining by 31%, and ferrous and metal production marked a 60% drop.\u00a0Positive growth was restored in 2010 but intercompany debt exceeded $59 billion, meaning that 60% of all Bulgarian companies were mutually indebted.\u00a0By 2012, it had increased to $97 billion, or 227% of GDP. The government implemented strict austerity measures with IMF and EU encouragement to some positive fiscal results, but the social consequences of these measures, such as increased\u00a0income inequality\u00a0and accelerated outward migration, have been &#8220;catastrophic&#8221; according to the\u00a0International Trade Union Confederation.<br \/>\nSiphoning of public funds to the families and relatives of politicians from incumbent parties has resulted in fiscal and welfare losses to society.\u00a0Bulgaria ranks 71st in the\u00a0Corruption Perceptions Index\u00a0and experiences the worst levels of\u00a0corruption\u00a0in the European Union, a phenomenon that remains a source of profound public discontent.\u00a0Along with organized crime, corruption has resulted in a rejection of the country&#8217;s\u00a0Schengen Area\u00a0application and withdrawal of foreign investment. Government officials reportedly engage in embezzlement, influence trading, government procurement violations and bribery with impunity.\u00a0Government procurement in particular is a critical area in corruption risk. An estimated 10 billion leva ($5.99 billion) of state budget and\u00a0European cohesion\u00a0funds are spent on public tenders each year; nearly 14 billion ($8.38 billion) were spent on public contracts in 2017 alone.\u00a0A large share of these contracts are awarded to a few politically connected\u00a0companies amid widespread irregularities, procedure violations and tailor-made award criteria.\u00a0Despite repeated criticism from the\u00a0European Commission,\u00a0EU institutions refrain from taking measures against Bulgaria because it supports Brussels on a number of issues, unlike\u00a0Poland\u00a0or\u00a0Hungary.<br \/>\nThe labour force is 3.36\u00a0million people,\u00a0of whom 6.8% are employed in agriculture, 26.6% in industry and 66.6% in the services sector.\u00a0Extraction of metals and minerals, production of\u00a0chemicals,\u00a0machine building, steel, biotechnology, tobacco and food processing and\u00a0petroleum refining\u00a0are among the major industrial activities. Mining alone employs 24,000 people and generates about 5% of the country&#8217;s GDP; the number of employed in all mining-related industries is 120,000.\u00a0Bulgaria is Europe&#8217;s fifth-largest coal producer.\u00a0Local deposits of coal, iron, copper and lead are vital for the manufacturing and energy sectors.<br \/>\nTwo-thirds of food and agricultural exports go to\u00a0OECD\u00a0countries.\u00a0Although cereal and vegetable output dropped by 40% between 1990 and 2008, output has since increased, and the 2016\u20132017 season registered the biggest grain output in a decade. Maize,\u00a0barley,\u00a0oats\u00a0and\u00a0rice\u00a0are also grown. Quality\u00a0Oriental tobacco\u00a0is a significant industrial crop.\u00a0Bulgaria is also the largest producer globally of\u00a0lavender\u00a0and\u00a0rose oil, both widely used in fragrances.\u00a0Of the services sector,\u00a0tourism\u00a0is a significant contributor to economic growth. Bulgaria has emerged as a travelling destination with its inexpensive resorts and beaches outside the reach of the tourist industry.\u00a0Most of the visitors are Romanian, German, Turkish, British and Russian. Sofia,\u00a0Plovdiv,\u00a0Veliko Tarnovo, coastal resorts\u00a0Golden Sands\u00a0and\u00a0Sunny Beach\u00a0and winter resorts\u00a0Bansko,\u00a0Pamporovo\u00a0and\u00a0Borovets\u00a0are some of the locations most visited by tourists.<br \/>\n<strong>Infrastructure<br \/>\n<\/strong>Telephone services are widely available, and a central digital trunk line connects most regions.\u00a0Vivacom\u00a0(BTC) serves more than 90% of fixed lines and is one of the three operators providing mobile services, along with\u00a0A1\u00a0and\u00a0Telenor.\u00a0Internet\u00a0penetration stood at 61.9% of the population aged 16\u201374, in 2017.<br \/>\nBulgaria&#8217;s strategic geographic location and well-developed energy sector make it a key European energy centre despite its lack of significant fossil fuel deposits. Thermal power plants generate 48.9% of electricity, followed by\u00a0nuclear power\u00a0from the\u00a0Kozloduy reactors\u00a0(34.8%) and\u00a0renewable sources\u00a0(16.3%).\u00a0Equipment for a second nuclear power station at\u00a0Belene\u00a0has been acquired, but the fate of the project remains uncertain.\u00a0Installed capacity amounts to 12,668 MW, allowing Bulgaria to exceed domestic demand and export energy.<br \/>\nThe national road network has a total length of 19,512 kilometres (12,124\u00a0mi),\u00a0of which 19,235 kilometres (11,952\u00a0mi) are paved. Railroads are a major mode of freight transportation, although highways carry a progressively larger share of freight. Bulgaria has 6,238 kilometres (3,876\u00a0mi) of railway track\u00a0and currently a total of 81 kilometres (50 miles) of\u00a0high-speed lines\u00a0are in operation.\u00a0Rail links are available with Romania, Turkey, Greece, and Serbia, and express trains serve direct routes to\u00a0Kiev,\u00a0Minsk,\u00a0Moscow\u00a0and\u00a0Saint Petersburg.\u00a0Sofia and Plovdiv are the country&#8217;s air travel hubs, while Varna and Burgas are the principal maritime trade ports.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DEMOGRAPHICS<br \/>\n<\/strong>The population of Bulgaria is 7,360,000 people according to the 2011 national census. The majority of the population, or 72.5%, reside in urban areas.\u00a0As of 2017, Sofia is the most populated urban centre with 1,330,000 people, followed by\u00a0Plovdiv\u00a0(345,000),\u00a0Varna\u00a0(344,000),\u00a0Burgas\u00a0(209,000) and\u00a0Ruse\u00a0(160,000).<\/p>\n<p>Bulgarians\u00a0are the main ethnic group and comprise 84.8% of the population.\u00a0Turkish\u00a0and\u00a0Roma\u00a0minorities comprise 8.8 and 4.9%, respectively; some 40 smaller minorities comprise 0.7%, and 0.8% do not self-identify with an ethnic group.\u00a0Former\u00a0Statistics\u00a0head\u00a0Reneta Indzhova\u00a0has disputed the 2011 census figures, suggesting the actual population is smaller than reported.\u00a0The Roma minority is usually underestimated in census data and may represent up to 11% of the population.\u00a0Population density is 65 per square kilometre, almost half the European Union average.<br \/>\nBulgaria is in a state of demographic crisis.\u00a0It has had negative population growth since the early 1990s, when the economic collapse caused a long-lasting emigration wave.\u00a0Some 937,000 to 1,200,000 people\u2014mostly young adults\u2014left the country by 2005.\u00a0The\u00a0total fertility rate\u00a0(TFR) was estimated at 1.46 children born per woman in 2017. The majority of children are born to unmarried women.\u00a0Furthermore, a third of all households consist of only one person and 75.5% of families do not have children under the age of 16.\u00a0The resulting birth rates are among the lowest in the world while\u00a0death rates\u00a0are among the highest.<br \/>\nHigh death rates result from a combination of an ageing population, a high number of people at risk of poverty and a weak healthcare system.\u00a0More than 80% of all deaths are due to\u00a0cancer\u00a0and\u00a0cardiovascular conditions; nearly a fifth of those are avoidable.\u00a0Mortality rates can be sharply reduced to levels below the EU average through timely and adequate access to medical services, which the healthcare system does not provide fully.\u00a0Although\u00a0healthcare in Bulgaria\u00a0is nominally universal,\u00a0out-of-pocket expenses account for nearly half of all healthcare spending, which significantly limits access to medical care.\u00a0Other problems disrupting care provision are the emigration of doctors due to low wages, understaffed and under-equipped regional hospitals, supply shortages and frequent changes to the basic service package for those insured.\u00a0The 2018 Bloomberg Health Care Efficiency Index ranked Bulgaria last out of 56 countries.\u00a0Average\u00a0life expectancy\u00a0is 74.7 years compared with an EU average of 80.2 and a world average of 69.<br \/>\n<strong>Education.<\/strong> Public expenditures for education are far below the European Union average as well.\u00a0Educational standards\u00a0were once high,\u00a0but have declined significantly since the early 2000s.\u00a0Bulgarian students were among the highest-scoring in the world in terms of reading in 2001, performing better than their Canadian and German counterparts; by 2006, scores in reading, math and science had dropped. Although average\u00a0literacy\u00a0stands at 98.4% with no significant difference between sexes,\u00a0functional illiteracy\u00a0is significant. The\u00a0PISA study of 2015 found 41.5% of pupils in the 9th grade to be functionally illiterate in reading, maths and science.<br \/>\nHigher education consists of a 4-year\u00a0bachelor\u00a0degree and a 1-year master&#8217;s degree.\u00a0Bulgaria&#8217;s highest-ranked higher education institution is\u00a0Sofia University.<br \/>\n<strong>Language. <\/strong>Bulgarian\u00a0is the only language with official status and native for 85% of the population.\u00a0It belongs to the\u00a0Slavic group of languages, but it has a number of grammatical peculiarities, shared with its closest relative\u00a0Macedonian, that set it apart from other Slavic languages: these include a complex verbal morphology (which also codes for distinctions in\u00a0evidentiality), the absence of\u00a0noun cases\u00a0and\u00a0infinitives, and the use of a suffixed\u00a0definite article.\u00a0Other major languages are\u00a0Turkish\u00a0and\u00a0Romani, which according to the 2011 census were spoken natively by 9.1% and 4.2% respectively.<br \/>\n<strong>Equality.<\/strong> The country scores high in\u00a0gender equality, ranking 18th in the 2018\u00a0Global Gender Gap Report. Although\u00a0women&#8217;s suffrage\u00a0was enabled relatively late, in 1937, women today have equal political rights, high workforce participation and legally mandated\u00a0equal pay.\u00a0Bulgaria has the highest ratio of female ICT researchers in the EU,\u00a0as well as the second-highest ratio of females in the technology sector at 44.6% of the workforce. High levels of female participation are a legacy of the Socialist era.<br \/>\n<strong>Religion<\/strong>. More than three-quarters of Bulgarians subscribe to\u00a0Eastern Orthodoxy.\u00a0Sunni Muslims\u00a0are the second-largest religious community and constitute 10% of Bulgaria&#8217;s overall religious makeup, although a majority of them are not observant and find the use of\u00a0Islamic veils\u00a0in schools unacceptable.\u00a0Less than 3% of the population are affiliated with\u00a0other religions\u00a0and 11.8% are irreligious or do not self-identify with a religion. The\u00a0Bulgarian Orthodox Church\u00a0gained\u00a0autocephalous\u00a0status in AD 927, and has 12 dioceses and over 2,000 priests. Bulgaria is a\u00a0secular state\u00a0with guaranteed religious freedom by constitution, but Orthodoxy is designated as a &#8220;traditional&#8221; religion.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CULTURE<br \/>\n<\/strong>Contemporary Bulgarian culture blends the formal culture that helped forge a national consciousness towards the end of Ottoman rule with millennia-old folk traditions.\u00a0An essential element of Bulgarian folklore is fire, used to banish evil spirits and illnesses. Many of these are personified as witches, whereas other creatures like\u00a0zmey\u00a0and\u00a0samodiva\u00a0(veela) are either benevolent guardians or ambivalent tricksters.\u00a0Some rituals against evil spirits have survived and are still practised, most notably\u00a0kukeri\u00a0and\u00a0survakari.\u00a0Martenitsa\u00a0is also widely celebrated.\u00a0Nestinarstvo, a ritual fire-dance of Thracian origin, is included in the list of\u00a0UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage.<br \/>\nNine historical and natural objects\u00a0are\u00a0UNESCO World Heritage Sites:\u00a0Pirin National Park,\u00a0Sreburna Nature Reserve, the\u00a0Madara Rider, the Thracian tombs in\u00a0Sveshtari\u00a0and\u00a0Kazanlak, the\u00a0Rila Monastery, the\u00a0Boyana Church, the\u00a0Rock-hewn Churches of Ivanovo\u00a0and the ancient city of\u00a0Nesebar.\u00a0The Rila Monastery was established by Saint\u00a0John of Rila, Bulgaria&#8217;s\u00a0patron saint, whose life has been the subject of numerous literary accounts since Medieval times.<br \/>\nThe establishment of the\u00a0Preslav\u00a0and\u00a0Ohrid\u00a0literary schools in the 10th century is associated with a golden period in Bulgarian literature during the\u00a0Middle Ages.\u00a0The schools&#8217; emphasis on Christian\u00a0scriptures\u00a0made the Bulgarian Empire a centre of Slavic culture, bringing Slavs under the influence of Christianity and providing them with\u00a0a written language.<br \/>\nIts alphabet,\u00a0Cyrillic\u00a0script, was developed by the Preslav Literary School.\u00a0The\u00a0Tarnovo Literary School, on the other hand, is associated with a Silver age of literature defined by high-quality manuscripts on historical or mystical themes under the\u00a0Asen\u00a0and\u00a0Shishman\u00a0dynasties.\u00a0Many literary and artistic masterpieces were destroyed by the Ottoman conquerors, and artistic activities did not re-emerge until the\u00a0National Revival\u00a0in the 19th century. The enormous body of work of\u00a0Ivan Vazov\u00a0(1850\u20131921) covered every genre and touched upon every facet of Bulgarian society, bridging pre-Liberation works with literature of the newly established state.<br \/>\n\u0410 religious visual arts heritage includes\u00a0frescoes,\u00a0murals\u00a0and\u00a0icons, many produced by the medieval\u00a0Tarnovo Artistic School.\u00a0Like literature, it was not until the National Revival when Bulgarian visual arts began to reemerge.<br \/>\nFolk music is by far the most extensive traditional art and has slowly developed throughout the ages as a fusion of Far Eastern, Oriental, medieval Eastern Orthodox and standard Western European tonalities and modes.\u00a0Bulgarian folk music has a distinctive sound and uses a wide range of traditional instruments, such as\u00a0gadulka,\u00a0gaida,\u00a0kaval\u00a0and\u00a0tupan. A distinguishing feature is\u00a0extended rhythmical time, which has no equivalent in the rest of European music.<br \/>\n<strong>Media.<\/strong> The\u00a0Bulgarian National Radio,\u00a0bTV\u00a0and daily newspapers\u00a0Trud,\u00a0Dnevnik\u00a0and\u00a024 Chasa\u00a0are some of the largest national media outlets.\u00a0Bulgarian media\u00a0were described as generally unbiased in their reporting in the early 2000s and print media had no legal restrictions.\u00a0Since then,\u00a0freedom of the press\u00a0has deteriorated to the point where Bulgaria scores 111th globally in the World Press Freedom Index, lower than all European Union members and membership candidate states. The government has diverted EU funds to sympathetic media outlets and bribed others to be less critical on problematic topics, while attacks against individual journalists have increased.\u00a0Collusion between politicians, oligarchs and the media is widespread.<br \/>\n<strong>Cuisine.<\/strong> Bulgarian cuisine\u00a0is similar to that of other Balkan countries and demonstrates strong Turkish and Greek influences.\u00a0Yogurt,\u00a0lukanka,\u00a0banitsa,\u00a0shopska salad,\u00a0lyutenitsa\u00a0and\u00a0kozunak\u00a0are among the best-known local foods. Meat consumption is lower than the European average, given a cultural preference for a large variety of salads.\u00a0Bulgaria was the world&#8217;s second-largest wine exporter until 1989, but has since lost that position.\u00a0The 2016 harvest yielded 128 million litres of wine, of which 62 million was exported mainly to Romania, Poland and Russia.\u00a0Mavrud, Rubin,\u00a0Shiroka melnishka,\u00a0Dimiat\u00a0and\u00a0Cherven Misket\u00a0are the typical grapes used in\u00a0Bulgarian wine.\u00a0Rakia\u00a0is a traditional fruit\u00a0brandy\u00a0that was consumed in Bulgaria as early as the 14th century.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SPORTS<br \/>\n<\/strong>Bulgaria appeared at the\u00a0first modern Olympic games\u00a0in 1896, when it was represented by\u00a0gymnast\u00a0Charles Champaud.\u00a0Since then, Bulgarian athletes have won 52 gold, 89 silver, and 83 bronze medals,\u00a0ranking 25th in the\u00a0all-time medal table.\u00a0Weight-lifting\u00a0is a signature sport of Bulgaria. Coach\u00a0Ivan Abadzhiev\u00a0developed innovative training practices that have produced many Bulgarian world and Olympic champions in weight-lifting since the 1980s.\u00a0Bulgarian athletes have also excelled in\u00a0wrestling,\u00a0boxing, gymnastics,\u00a0volleyball and\u00a0tennis.\u00a0Stefka Kostadinova\u00a0is the reigning\u00a0world record\u00a0holder in the women&#8217;s\u00a0high jump\u00a0at 2.09 metres (6\u00a0feet 10\u00a0inches), achieved during the\u00a01987 World Championships. Grigor Dimitrov\u00a0is the first Bulgarian tennis player in the Top 3\u00a0ATP Rankings.<br \/>\nFootball\u00a0is the most popular sport in the country by a substantial margin. The\u00a0national football team&#8217;s best performance was a semi-final at the\u00a01994 FIFA World Cup, when the squad was spearheaded by forward\u00a0Hristo Stoichkov.\u00a0Stoichkov is the most successful Bulgarian player of all time; he was awarded the\u00a0Golden Boot\u00a0and the\u00a0Golden Ball\u00a0and was considered one of the best in the world while playing for\u00a0FC Barcelona\u00a0in the 1990s.\u00a0CSKA\u00a0and\u00a0Levski, both based in Sofia,\u00a0are the most successful clubs domestically and\u00a0long-standing rivals.\u00a0Ludogorets\u00a0is remarkable for having advanced from the local fourth division to the\u00a02014\u201315 UEFA Champions League group stage in a mere nine years. Placed 39th in 2018, it is Bulgaria&#8217;s highest-ranked club in\u00a0UEFA.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>TIPS for BULGARIA 1. Road Toll Tax.
