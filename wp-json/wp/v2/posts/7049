As they didn&#8217;t appear to be hauling yet, it seemed like an opportune time to avail ourselves of said new road and make an attempt on the lofty Mt Rinda. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">So it was, on June 17, 2006 that Sandra, Delia Roberts, Kumo, and I found ourselves bumping our way up the newly extended Gasga FSR. The road was still pretty rough and bumpy, but we were able to drive to km 3.2, where the road was 1 blocked by an excavator \u2013 which wasn&#8217;t a big deal, as the road was too soft to continue driving anyway (~1375 m). <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">We shouldered our packs and followed the remainder of the incipient road, a distance of less than a km, to its end near the south ridge of Rinda at around 1520 m. Under increasingly threatening skies (it was mid-June, after all) we made our way up through the surprisingly open forest of the south ridge until we broke out of the trees and gained the long summit ridge of Rinda. There was very little snow about as we continued along the undulating ridge to the final exciting step across a chasm to the summit block \u2013 four hours from the truck. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">While we were lucky that despite all the showers around, we were only hit with a short graupel blast, the anticipated views of the Mulvey Group were hindered by the clouds hiding many of the peaks \u2013 but on a sunny day, Mt Rinda would provide an exceptional viewpoint. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Notes: \u2022The Gasga FSR branches off the Hoder Creek road at km 5.8. \u2022We found all manner of survey string and flagging high on the southwest slopes of Rinda (there appears to be beetle damage high on the south and southeast slopes) and I suspect that in a couple of years, it may be possible to drive to 2000 m, or possibly higher. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Doug Brown<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\"><strong>MT. RINDA &#8211; THEN AND NOW <\/strong>by Maurice de St. Jorre<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Then was Sept. 2, 1956. A somewhat younger Bob Dean left his car at the Little Slocan Lake for his first ever Kootenay hike, going directly up through the bush on the east side of Mt. Rinda (2499m. 8199\u2019) and eventually arriving at the summit. Finding no water, and only a stunning view of the entire southern Valhalla range, untrammeled by any sign of human activity, he decided to head straight down to the lush green meadows of slide alder and the tinkling stream of roadless Hoder Creek. Over a day later he made it back to his car. Two days after that, he repeated the whole trip to recover his driver\u2019s license and a $5 bill he had inadvertently left at his bivouac site. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Now was Aug. 5, 2006. Bob, Gene Van Dyck and I drove 6 km up the Hoder Creek FSR from the Little Slocan Lakes, turned off to the right up the new Gasga Creek FSR, and were transported effortlessly to about 5100 ft. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">We then strolled leisurely through park-like surroundings to a pleasant scramble up the south ridge of Rinda, arriving at the notch just east of the summit in 2\u00be hours. The notch is just one move of fourth class which was soon overcome. We spent an hour on the summit in brilliant sunshine, gazing at the panorama of the Valhallas, before returning to the truck in about 2 hours. Many things have changed over the past 50 years, but it still remains the best viewpoint to see the south end of the Valhalla Range. Judging from the flagging in the bush above the Gasga FSR, it will apparently end up at least at 6000 ft. making the summit of Rinda no more than a 2-hour hike from the road head. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Fortunately, the west ridge of Rinda stretches on for at least 8 km past the summit, all of which is above tree line. It is an excellent ridge walk, which could be turned into a circuit ending either at Drinnon Pass or in the south Fork of Bannockburn Creek. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Maurice de St. Jorre<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>MOUNT RINDA 2500m Mount Rinda is located on the southeast end of the ridge between Hoder and Bannock Burn Creeks.
