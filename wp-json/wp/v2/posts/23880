But having some form of a relationship with someone who has narcissism is not uncommon. The disorder\u2014characterized by arrogance, grandiosity, a lack of empathy, exploitativeness, aggression, and a constant need for affirmation and admiration\u2014also has a more alluring side. \u201cWe\u2019re attracted to narcissists at first,\u201d says Amy Brunell, professor of psychology at Ohio State University and a prolific researcher of narcissism. \u201cThey\u2019re charming, they\u2019re fun, they\u2019re energetic, and then over time, the negative qualities come out more and more.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Brunell wrote a recent\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/core\/elements\/abs\/understanding-and-coping-in-social-relationships-with-narcissists\/FC977322AFC019DE5F9E469B125863A4\">scientific article<\/a><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> on how to understand narcissism and cope when you\u2019re in a relationship with a narcissist. Here\u2019s what she says you should know about how to navigate those relationships.<\/p>\n<p><\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;\">How can narcissism present?<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As Brunell describes it, narcissists are \u201cself-centered, they\u2019re entitled, and very often they think the world should revolve around them.\u201d But they don&#8217;t all present the same way.<\/p>\n<p><\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A large body of work going back decades divides narcissism into three types:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1467-6494.2008.00492.x\">agentic narcissism<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0029629\">communal narcissism<\/a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1467-6494.2008.00492.x\">vulnerable<\/a> narcissism. Of the three, agentic narcissism is the most recognizable\u2014and toxic. Agentic narcissists hold exalted views of themselves, seeing their competence and intelligence as far greater than that of others, Brunell explains. In an effort to maintain that self-image, they will often derogate the talents and temperaments of friends, colleagues, and family members. They are more invested in status and admiration than they are in intimacy. They self-promote tirelessly, harbor grandiose fantasies of their prospects and projects, and often engage in rivalries with people\u2014especially work colleagues\u2014who threaten their sense of primacy.<\/p>\n<p><\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cAsk these narcissists about themselves [and] they say, \u2018Oh yeah, I&#8217;m so pro-social and so great,\u2019\u201d says Brunell. \u201cBut if you ask their peers about them, they actually see them as being kind of aggressive.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Read More:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/6262891\/psychology-terms-misused-gaslighting-toxic-narcissist\/\"><em>Gaslighting, Narcissist, and More Psychology Terms You\u2019re Misusing<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p><\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Communal narcissists<\/strong> seek out admiration by being exceedingly\u2014often excessively\u2014caring and helpful, sometimes offering assistance when it\u2019s neither needed nor requested. That kind of other-directedness seems inconsistent with the me-first impulses of narcissism; however, the behavior does not come from a place of genuine altruism, but instead from a need to be loved and admired, Brunell says.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cCommunal narcissists are self-enhancing,\u201d she says. \u201cThey think they\u2019re the most helpful person\u2014that no one can do as much good as they do.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The <strong>vulnerable narcissist<\/strong> is the most fragile type. Vulnerable narcissists have none of the overweening self-regard that is the province of the agentic or communal narcissist, Brunell explains; instead, they overcompensate for a deep sense of low self-esteem. Often, they can be socially inhibited, defensive, anxious, and depressed\u2014a painful suite of feelings that they try to battle with egotism, arrogance, defensiveness, and self-centeredness..<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cVulnerable narcissists feel bad about themselves,\u201d says Brunell. \u201cThey are chronically mad that they\u2019re not getting what they think is due them, so they tend to be more hostile. For a while, I struggled with understanding why vulnerable narcissists are narcissists at all, except they share the core feature of self-centeredness.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">What causes narcissism?<br \/>\n<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The roots of narcissism are as varied as the types. Some research, including a 2014\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/articles\/PMC3973692\/#:~:text=A%20total%20of%20304%20pairs,considerable%20non%2Dshared%20environmental%20influences.\">study<\/a>\u00a0of twins in China, suggests that genetics may play a role, with both grandiosity and entitlement seeming to be shared more by the twins than by other siblings.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.adinaaba.com\/post\/is-narcissism-hereditary\">Other studies<\/a>\u00a0comparing adopted children to biological children point to heritability too, with the biological children exhibiting more of the behavior of their narcissistic parents than adopted children.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But the research in this area is not robust. \u201cThere is some evidence that narcissism is genetic, though it\u2019s small,\u201d says Brunell. This type of research is also cloudy: \u201cWithin families, you\u2019re looking at shared genes, but you\u2019re also looking at behaviors that are learned from generation to generation.\u201d In general, most researchers in the narcissism field lean toward the \u201cnurture\u201d rather than the \u201cnature\u201d school. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty easy to answer from the perspective of grandiose narcissism that parents kind of create these little narcissists,\u201d Brunell says.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Too much parental praise, Brunell writes in her new paper, can cause the child to \u201cdevelop an inflated sense of self as \u2018special\u2019 that can only be maintained through continual admiration by others.\u201d The same parenting trait can also give rise to communal narcissism, with exalted children growing up to believe that they are uniquely qualified to serve and save the world.<\/p>\n<p><\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Vulnerable narcissists are created in the opposite way: by parents who dismiss, ignore, or demean. These kinds of starvation rations of parental approval lead the child to look elsewhere for emotional nourishment. <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cWith vulnerable narcissism,\u201d says Brunell, \u201ca lot of times children are criticized harshly, and they start to experience that anger and that rage at not being seen.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Can narcissists change?|<br \/>\n<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Narcissism is not typically like other emotional or psychological conditions. The person with a phobia does not want to be terrified of spiders. The person with depression does not want to be so sad. Many narcissists, on the other hand, are sold on the idea of their own uniqueness and often do not want to change, Brunell says\u2014even if they know that their behavior is working against them.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cThere\u2019s a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0023781\">body of research<\/a>\u00a0that suggests that narcissists know that other people find them annoying,\u201d Brunell says. \u201cThey know that their reputations aren\u2019t great. But they don\u2019t put that awareness to work and change. They still think it\u2019s the other person\u2019s fault. They think that you\u2019re jealous, that you don\u2019t see how great they are.\u201d<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Still, Brunell points out that people with narcissism generally disapprove of narcissistic traits in others\u2014evidence that they are not incapable of recognizing the downsides of the behavior.<\/p>\n<p><\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There&#8217;s some research that finds narcissism can improve. One 2014\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/spc3.12128\">study<\/a>\u00a0showed that when people who exhibit agentic narcissism were asked to make and endorse such communal statements as \u201cI am a caring person,\u201d they reported behaving less narcissistically in real-world situations afterwards, though the effect was temporary. The same study showed similar improvement when narcissists were asked to recall a time when they showed concern, love, and acceptance for another person. \u201cThe thing is to get them to talk or think more in terms of \u2018we,\u2019\u201d says Brunell.<\/p>\n<p><\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">How to cope with narcissism in relationships<br \/>\n<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When dealing with a narcissistic parent or partner, it can help to be direct about the changes you\u2019d like to see the person make, Brunell says, but to stress that you\u2019re making that request because that person is important to you.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cFor a child, if you get a parent angry, they can take away all of your resources,\u201d says Brunell. \u201cI would suggest that rather than necessarily confronting the parent, they can approach them in a way where they say, \u2018Mom, I really care about our relationship and making you happy,\u2019 and then try to assert yourself.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In a romantic relationship, it helps to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/6331383\/how-to-set-boundaries-family\/\">set up clear boundaries<\/a> for behaviors that will and won\u2019t be tolerated, but those conversations can often end in grief. \u201cNarcissists tend to be highly reactive and tend to play the victim, so they don\u2019t necessarily handle critical feedback well,\u201d Brunell says. \u201cStill, if you couch it in a way that you care about the other person, you can maybe temper the blow a little bit.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Things are trickier with a narcissistic boss, because, like a parent, that person may have the ability to deny you something important\u2014in this case, your job. Here Brunell recommends being mindful of what your goals are in any encounter with a narcissistic boss\u2014what you\u2019re trying to get out of a meeting, say\u2014and not getting distracted or rattled by bad behavior.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cHave an agenda for every meeting,\u201d she says. \u201cKnow what you need from it, and then set expectations for what you\u2019re going to get and what you\u2019re not going to get.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><\/span><strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When to say goodbye<br \/>\n<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Often, the healthiest way to handle a relationship with a narcissist is to leave it, Brunell says. When it comes to a romantic relationship, anything that makes a person feel unsafe\u2014any suggestion at all of violence\u2014requires leaving. Those relationships must end. Short of that, things often depend on how much of an effort the partner without narcissism wants to continue to put in.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cIf you\u2019ve tried everything there is to try and you&#8217;re not getting your needs met, if you&#8217;re chronically feeling torn down and not seen, if you&#8217;ve tried therapy, if you&#8217;ve tried working with your partner, then it may be time to end the relationship,\u201d Brunell says. The stakes aren\u2019t as high in a friendship with a narcissistic, but the same guidelines apply.<\/p>\n<p><\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Then there is the dilemma that can arise when you have a good job with a bad boss\u2014doing work you love for a manager you loathe. In this case, Brunell recommends assessing whether it\u2019s possible to do the same kind of work elsewhere\u2014possibilities you can explore on your own while continuing to work at your present job\u2014and then grab the opportunity if one presents itself.<\/p>\n<p><\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When people free themselves of these toxic dynamics, they still have some work ahead of them. It\u2019s important, for one thing, not to let someone creep back into your life who you want out. \u201cIf the narcissist calls you and you don\u2019t want to take the call, that can be your boundary,\u201d Brunell says. \u201cI think feeling a little bit more empowered to make those decisions for yourself can be really important.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Both during the relationship and after it ends, it\u2019s also important to seek out the validation and emotional support you probably haven\u2019t been getting. Friends, teachers, and mentors can all provide these kinds of resources. The point is to remember your own agency. \u201cSometimes,\u201d says Brunell, \u201cwe feel stuck in situations that we\u2019re not actually stuck in. It just feels that way.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How to Deal With a Narcissist By\u00a0Jeffrey Kluger February 10, 2025 TIME MAGAZINE Narcissistic personality disorder is relatively rare, affecting just\u00a01-2% of Americans by some estimates.
