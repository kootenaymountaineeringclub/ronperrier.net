It was a bad move. The dictatorship of Siad Barre, who took office in 1969, marginalised and massacred Somalilanders. On May 18th 1991, five months after his fall, what was by then simply Somaliland declared independence. It was a statement of intent\u2014and regret. Exiles returned home to rebuild their nation. \u201cHargeisa had been destroyed to rubble,\u201d recalls Suad Ibrahim Abdi, a campaigner for women\u2019s rights. \u201cThere were no buildings, no water.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"ds-layout-grid ds-layout-grid--edged layout-article-body\">\n<div class=\"article-audio-player\"><\/div>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">What happened next is Somaliland\u2019s founding story. At confabs\u2014under trees or desert stars\u2014clans agreed to share power. Presidential elections followed with regularity. The country is poor but, without much aid, it has developed somewhat. Hargeisa is not the prettiest capital, but it serves a fine camel-milkshake. All of this contrasts with the chaos in Somalia, where foreigners have lavished money and guns.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">This month Somalilanders will mark 30 years of peace. The country of 4.5m people is winning friends abroad. But its sovereignty remains unrecognised. When discussing it, the West defers to African countries, which defer to Somalia, which is dead against ceding suzerainty. \u201cThe big question\u201d, says Ms Abdi, is \u201cfine, we\u2019ve made progress. But where are we going from here?\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">One answer can be seen in Berbera, on the Gulf of Aden. \u201cWe call it our hope,\u201d says Khalifa Ibrahim, an adviser to the mayor, pointing to the expanded port opened in 2018 by\u00a0<small>dp<\/small>\u00a0World. Somaliland hopes that the investment of $442m (the largest in its history) by the Dubai-based port operator will prove catalytic for its economy. Port fees and custom taxes already account for 70-80% of government revenues. Planned alongside the new facility are a free-trade zone, an airport, hotels, an oil terminal and a park for 1,000 lorries. Land values have soared ten-fold.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Somaliland sees the port as bringing political benefits, too. \u201cIt has upgraded our position in the region,\u201d argues Abdishakur Mohamoud Hassan, the mayor. Ethiopia under Abiy Ahmed, its prime minister, has grown closer to Somalia. His landlocked country depends on the port of Djibouti for most of its imports. The new facility at Berbera, in which Ethiopia has a 19% stake, gives it another option.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Berbera also gives the United Arab Emirates (<small>uae<\/small>) an alternative foothold in the region. After a long dispute, Djibouti seized the\u00a0<small>dp<\/small>\u00a0World facility there in 2018. Somalia\u2019s government in Mogadishu is allied to Turkey and Qatar, which are rivals to the\u00a0<small>uae<\/small>, which in March became the first Arab country to send a permanent diplomat to Hargeisa.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">It has joined others in establishing a presence. Kenya recently announced it will set up a consulate in the capital. In August Taiwan opened its East Africa office there and pledged aid for its fellow sovereignty-challenged country. China tried to block the move. But Somaliland said it would not support the principle that there is only one China, with Taiwan a part of it. \u201cSomaliland showed backbone,\u201d says Allen Chenhwa Lou, the Taiwanese representative.<\/p>\n<div id=\"\" class=\"advert incontent  advert--inline\">\n<div>\n<div id=\"econ-2\" data-google-query-id=\"CPapltnAt_ACFUjBwgQdyDwBXQ\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Such diplomatic advances show how far Somaliland has come in 30 years. Yet some locals worry about whether its clan-based political system that established stability is still the right one. \u201cSomalilanders always say that we\u2019re a good model for the continent,\u201d says Guleid Jama of the Human Rights Centre, a local\u00a0<\/span><small>ngo<\/small><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we are any more.\u201d<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"article__body-text-image\">\n<figure>\n<div data-slim=\"1\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/608\/667\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210508_MAM988.png\" sizes=\"300px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/200\/219\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210508_MAM988.png 200w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/300\/329\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210508_MAM988.png 300w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/400\/439\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210508_MAM988.png 400w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/600\/658\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210508_MAM988.png 600w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/640\/702\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210508_MAM988.png 640w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/800\/878\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210508_MAM988.png 800w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/1000\/1097\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210508_MAM988.png 1000w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/1280\/1404\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210508_MAM988.png 1280w\" alt=\"\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">The constitution passed in 2001 was meant to loosen the grip of clans on politics. It limits the number of political parties to three, encouraging coalitions. But most voters still invariably vote by clan.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">It is a system that \u201cmakes us less prosperous\u201d, argues Mohamed Fadal of the Social Research &amp; Development Institute, a local think-tank. Jobs and contracts are spread around on the basis of clan, not merit. \u201cYou cannot leave a clan behind\u201d is the founding principle of Somaliland\u2019s politics, explains Mohamed Farah of the Academy for Peace and Development, another think-tank. It may be a better model than the winner-takes-all ethnic politics in some countries, but many citizens feel it stunts the development of true democracy.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Institutions meant to hold government to account are weak. Judges bow to the executive and rarely prosecute corruption. Parliament is a rubber stamp. On May 31st Somaliland will hold parliamentary elections for the first time for 16 years. Media could be much freer. Foreign journalists are treated with grace and kindness, but local ones can be arrested for upsetting the wrong person. Last year a court ordered a local social-media star to be deported for a post in which he drank tea from a mug with a picture of Somalia\u2019s flag.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">In the courtyard of the Hargeisa Cultural Centre, young Somalilanders are dancing and making music videos. Jama Musse Jama, the centre\u2019s director, points at them through his office window, noting that 70% of the country is under the age of 30. \u201cPeace is not enough for these young people,\u201d he says. \u201cThey need jobs and opportunities.\u201d An estimated 75% do not have a job.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Women are neglected, too. Sucaad Odowa spent 24 years in London before returning to Hargeisa. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t count on the status of women in my country,\u201d she says, citing how women lack rights to divorce and need the consent of a male relative for caesarean sections. Women\u2019s inequality has led her to run for parliament against the wishes of her clan elders. The 82-member lower house has but a single female\u00a0<small>mp<\/small>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Islam is another conservative force. A women\u2019s football tournament was called off last year for apparently transgressing sharia. In the city of Burao a \u201cvice-prevention committee\u201d has closed several female-owned businesses.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Some Somalilanders privately admit that the lack of international recognition is a handy excuse for domestic shortcomings. Yet so long as it is unrecognised, it is hard for the government to get aid and loans, and for businesses to sell things abroad. Travelling on a Somaliland passport, which many countries do not recognise, can be a nightmare.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Soon Somaliland will have spent longer as a de facto independent country than it did as part of a united Somalia. Most Somalilanders know no other status. And they want their country to write its own story, even if it is not always a fairy tale.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"article__description\" data-test-id=\"Article Description\"><strong>A State of one&#8217;s own. <\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Somaliland deerves international recognition<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>It is far more functional than Somalia, the state to which it notionally belongs<br \/>\n<\/strong>May 6 2021 Economist<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"ds-layout-grid ds-layout-grid--edged layout-article-body\">\n<p class=\"article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap\" data-caps=\"initial\">Somaliland&#8217;s first stab at independence lasted less than a week. Pipers of the Royal Highland Fusiliers were ordered to play the new state\u2019s national anthem at a ceremony in Hargeisa, the capital, marking the end of British colonial rule in June 1960. On discovering that it did not have one, the bandmaster cobbled together a medley of local folk tunes, and conducted it with brio. A day later, however, Somaliland\u2019s parliament passed an act of union with Somalia, a former Italian colony to its south, and Somaliland officially was no more.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">It was a catastrophic mistake. Within a decade the new Somali Republic had collapsed. Its president was assassinated by his bodyguards. A Marxist junta seized power, led by Siad Barre, a general-turned-dictator. He abolished democracy and wrecked the economy by nationalising nearly everything except camel herds. He also launched a disastrous war against Ethiopia. When the northerners rebelled, he bombed Hargeisa, killing thousands of civilians. As Somalia disintegrated into clan warfare, Barre refused to negotiate, saying: \u201cWhen I leave Somalia, I will leave behind buildings but no people.\u201d He was not far off the mark. By the time he fled, in 1991, the country had plunged into chaos from which it has yet to emerge.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Somaliland unsurprisingly wanted out. Its elders agreed to break away from the rest of Somalia in 1991 at a \u201cGrand Shir\u201d, or gathering of clans, held in a small town in the desert. Since then,\u00a0Somaliland\u00a0has become a functioning state in all but name, with 4.5m people on an area bigger than Florida. It has been largely peaceful. It controls its borders and its territory, unlike Somalia\u2019s government, which controls little more than its capital city, and that only thanks to 20,000 foreign peacekeepers. Whereas Somalia has not held a direct election since the 1960s, Somaliland periodically votes for its president and lawmakers, even if polls are marred by attacks on the press and take place less often than they should.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Yet in the eyes of the world Somaliland remains part of Somalia. For longer than most of its people have been alive, its pleas for recognition as an independent state have been ignored. The world defers on this to the African Union, the continental arbiter. It, in turn, argues that Somaliland can win independence only with the consent of Somalia, which says no.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">The obvious objection to recognising Somaliland is that redrawing maps is perilous. This is especially so in Africa, where borders thoughtlessly imposed in colonial times separate countless clans and ethnic groups from their kin. Untangling this mess would be so tricky that a consensus long ago emerged: leave the map as it is.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Once you start moving borders or creating new states for this or that group, others will demand their own homelands, too, and blood will surely flow. Witness Africa\u2019s two newest breakaway countries, Eritrea and South Sudan, which have become a gulag state and a war zone. Were Somaliland to win independence, people in other bits of Somalia might try to break away, too, as would ethnic groups in Ethiopia, the regional power.<\/p>\n<div id=\"\" class=\"advert incontent advert--inline\">\n<div>\n<div id=\"econ-2\" data-google-query-id=\"CN_Xg6W-t_ACFeoYfQodvVUH_g\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">For all these reasons, Somaliland\u2019s case will not prevail soon. Yet it deserves a hearing. It is not seeking to redraw borders from scratch, but to revert to old ones. Some 97% of its people supported independence in a referendum in 2001. Scottish and Catalan nationalists can only dream of such unanimity. Most Somalilanders have known nothing but self-rule and would never consent to reintegrate with their bloody, anarchic suzerain.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Meanwhile, denying them recognition imposes severe human costs. Somalilanders cannot travel freely, since few countries accept Somaliland passports. They are poorer than they should be, since their government does not have the status to make trade deals or borrow directly from the World Bank or the\u00a0<small>imf<\/small>. Statehood would help fix some of these problems.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Ideally, Somaliland\u2019s separation should be achieved with the agreement of Somalia. For the time being this seems far-fetched. But Somalia should be encouraged to grant a divorce with promises of aid and debt relief from the donors who already bankroll its government and pay for the peacekeepers who prop it up. If, like an abusive spouse, Somalia refuses to let go, Somaliland should not be held hostage. Other countries should recognise it, and international organisations should treat it like a state.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Were Somaliland to win formal independence again, its road ahead would be hard. But the odds of flourishing would be much better this time. It now has not only a breezy national anthem but also a 30-year record of reasonably successful self-rule. To recognise that is to recognise reality.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Out of the rubble Somaliland, an unrecognized state, is winning frends aborad But storing up problems at home May 8 2021 Economist.
