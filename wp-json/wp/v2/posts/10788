I arrived at 19:30, my flight was at 10:10 and the AirMalta desk was closed so I was forced to stay landside in Terminal 1 \u2013 almost no restaurants, all the seats had arms and there was only a hard floor. Airside in Terminal 1 has reasonably soft places to sleep at gates E12, and E52, reclining chairs in B9, B11, D1 and H3. <\/em><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>A coffee shop in arrivals had some soft benches so I parked myself there writing this sad story. There were no electric plugs. I often sleep in airports (go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sleepinginginairports.com\">www.sleepinginginairports.net<\/a> to get advice) and some are wonderful with lounge chairs but this was almost as bad as it gets. To avoid the high baggage fees, I only had a small carry-on knapsack and a sleeping bag but no pad. And I had planned on doing the same thing on my return from Malta as my flight arrived at 17:50. I hate paying for hotels. I was kicked out of here at 21:00 and eventually slept well on some blue soft seats at the north end of departures (ADR Assistance sign). Despite the bright lights and all the stewardesses walking by in their high-heeled shoes, I had a good sleep. When I woke up, the other spots were all occupied. At 9 am, I was kicked out of here.<br \/>\n<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>TIPS for MALTA<br \/>\n1. Malta Museum and Travel Cards.<\/strong> What you buy will depend on what your needs are. If you are a family and not going to many museums but will be going to restaurants, then the Discount card might be right. When I googled, all I could see was this card so I bought it and it was a terrible deal for me. If you go to many museums, then the Heritage card would be correct.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><em>a. Malta Heritage.<\/em><\/strong> For 25 E for 2 days, this gives free admission to most museums (not the private ones). I ended up buying this for my last 2 days.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em><strong>b. Malta Discount Card<\/strong>.<\/em> Gives 10 days with up to 50% discounts at 150 establishments mostly restaurants. Buy online, get the app and they deliver to your hotel. You must have a physical card to get benefits. I ordered this on a Saturday and it wasn&#8217;t delivered to my hostel until Monday, so it was even less valuable. Some museums only give 30% discounts. \u20ac25<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><em>c. Tallinga card.<\/em><\/strong> This travel card for 21E for 7 days gives free transport on all buses and some ferries in Malta. If you don&#8217;t have a car, this is a good deal. But I think you would be waiting at a lot of bus stops, and the bus does not go everywhere.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">2. <strong>Costs.<\/strong> I found Malta in March unbelievably cheap: Return airfare from Rome on Air Malta (carry on only) &#8211; \u20ac169; Hostel four nights, free breakfast (Inhawi in St Julian rated 9.4) \u20ac45; car rental four days (declined insurance) &#8211; \u20ac12.96. Total fixed costs \u20ac227. Food in restaurants is comparably priced to the rest of Europe.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">3. <strong>Car rental.<\/strong> Unbelievably cheap. Watch if can take to Gozo on the terms and conditions as one agency charged \u20ac177 for this. Need International Drivers License. One of the main advantages of an elite credit card is that it pays for insurance &#8211; and much better insurance &#8211; if the car is paid for with the card.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">4. <strong>Electrical Plug.<\/strong> The same 3-plug as the UK, although there are some 2-pin European sockets.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>5. Driving in Malta.<\/strong> This is not for the faint-hearted. Malta has the 5th highest population density in Europe and the highest car ownership on the continent. Most of the roads are narrow and not uncommonly one lane hedged in between high rock walls. The only prevention is extreme defensive driving &#8211; go slow and watch for the asshole trucks. Motorcycles are distinctly rare &#8211; I only saw three in over 4 days of driving everywhere.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">a. Like many former British colonies, they drive on the left side of the road, but at least you get a car with the steering wheel on the right side. Shifting with your left hand is an issue. After driving for 50+ years on the other side ingrains many habits that could pose a problem, especially in situations where you must act reflexly. I have had some practice having driven in New Zealand, Namibia, South Africa and 3 months in the British Isles. Practice somewhere safe before getting onto the roads (the airport parking lot might be one place).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">b. The major roads present no special problems but many roads are so narrow that 2 cars can&#8217;t pass. Large vehicles like buses and trucks are not meant to be on these sorts of roads, but they are everywhere. The truck drivers are generally jerks and are often in your lane and driving too fast.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">c. Malta drivers are impatient and intolerant, and many drive at speeds inappropriate for the road. Many cut corners. But following close is not the problem it is in Italy.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>6. Hal Saflieni Hypogeum<br \/>\n<\/strong>A UNESCO World Heritage Site, part of the Megalithic Temples of Malta, and the prime tourist site in Malta make sure to make a reservation online as early as possible. Only 10 people are allowed in every hour and 80\/day and depending on the time of year reservations book out MONTHS ahead. The normal adult price is 40 euros, booked early it is 20 euros for seniors. At slow times of the year, there are last-minute tickets available at the site, but none of the reductions apply. I arrived on March 6 at 10 am and got one of the last tickets for noon the next day.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The tour is given totally by audioguide. The small size of the groups is dictated by the small size of the viewing areas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Day 1<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>After the one-hour and 10-minute flight to Malta, I got my rental car (Gold Cars 12.95 for 4 days!) and then had one of my more frustrating travel days. All my saved sites disappeared from Google Maps so my itinerary was difficult to determine. I was driving on the left side of the road in a very unfamiliar vehicle (a small Peugeot) and I bought a cheap cell phone holder for the windshield that broke within a few hours so my phone was not as visible as it could be. After being taken on a lot of backroads, the only positive was that I didn&#8217;t have an accident.<br \/>\nOn my first afternoon, I saw the only sights on the east side of the island.\u00a0<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>MARSAXLOKK<\/strong>\u0013 (pop 3,500)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">This small, traditional fishing village is in the South Eastern Region\u00a0of\u00a0Malta.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Most of Malta&#8217;s fish supplies are caught by fishermen coming from this port as about 70% of the Maltese fishing fleet is based there.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup> Swordfish, tuna, and the popular &#8216;lampuki&#8217; are caught in abundance between spring and late autumn. It has a harbour and is a tourist attraction notable for its picturesque views, its fishermen and history. The village is also known for the Marsaxlokk Market, a large fish market that takes place along the seafront on Sundays, and a tourist market during all other days of the week. Inhabited and well-known since antiquity, Marsaxlokk was used as a port by Phoenicians, and Carthaginians and also has the remains of a Roman-era harbour.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I arrived to see a large dance festival in the small town square in front of the church. Many little girls were in ornate outfits particular to their group. The flea market lined in the entire harbour full of little colourful fishing boats.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Parish Church of Our Lady of Pompei<\/strong>. The parish of Marsaxlokk was established when fishermen started to build houses near the sea coast to save time on travelling. Thus at the end of the 19th century, it was decided to build a church that would minister to the spiritual needs of the fishermen and their families. Started in 1897, in the 1900s the church was enlarged altering the shape to that of a Latin cross and in the late 1920s a new west front was constructed<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In 1899 a statue representing the Virgin Mary with baby Jesus presenting a rosary to\u00a0Saint Dominic\u00a0and\u00a0Saint Catherine of Siena was presented to the church.\u00a0The church also has a number of paintings by\u00a0Giuseppe Cal\u00ec.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Unfortunately, on a Sunday afternoon, it was closed, unusual for a Catholic church.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.picfair.com\/pics\/06001380-our-lady-of-pompei-church-in-marsaxlokk-malta\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwj-08Td_-bgAhUSCuwKHeJOAigQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/fleetnation\/image\/private\/c_fit,w_1120\/g_south,l_text:style_gothic2:%C2%A9%20Caron%20Badkin,o_20,y_10\/g_center,l_watermark4,o_25,y_50\/v1512933250\/uw5ihzdpwm9aaio6dgak.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Parish Church of Our Lady of Pompei\" width=\"529\" height=\"353\" data-iml=\"1551651352717\" \/><\/a><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nycago.org\/Organs\/NYC\/html\/OurLadyPompeii.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwid0Jf4_-bgAhXC-KQKHS3JAbYQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nycago.org\/Organs\/NYC\/img\/OurLadyPompeiGal1.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Parish Church of Our Lady of Pompei\" width=\"532\" height=\"353\" data-iml=\"1551651408588\" \/><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>ZURRIEQ.<\/strong> An NM &#8220;small town&#8221;, this small village on the south coast of Malta is popular with divers because of the Um el\u00a0 Faroud tanker wreck.\u00a0 Scuttled in 1998, three years after an explosion that killed nine dockworkers in Grand Harbour, a plaque was also erected in the dockyard to commemorate the lives of the fallen. After an unsettling journey with a moderate easterly swell, the Um el Faroud came to rest at 35m on the sand where you can see the 3,147 gross ton vessel, a single screw tanker, built in Middleborough, England in 1969. The dive site is normally referred to as the Blue Grotto, although the actual Blue Grotto is half a mile to the west of the inlet and can only be reached by the sea.\u00a0 The entry\/exit point can get very busy at peak times and the sea conditions must be checked for the currents can be hazardous.\u00a0 Care must also be given to the ample tourist boats that are in the area, and the fisherman lines. The wreck itself has been prepared for diving, with all doors and windows removed, and entrances and exit holes cut.\u00a0 Do not stay too long, to ensure you can explore the reef on the return.\u00a0 This is a great dive, suitable for experienced divers only, and using a 15l cylinder.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The &#8220;town&#8221; itself degenerates into narrow roads and rock walls surrounding small fields. Back into the actual village, I saw this well-known windmill.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Xarolla Windmill.<\/strong> (Mithra tax-Xarolla). Most windmills in Malta were built by the Knights with similar construction &#8211; a square stone building for a base topped by a round stone tower for the antennae with wood workings and grinding stones. Most were destroyed when steam power arrived &#8211; much more dependable than wind.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Xarolla mill was built in 1724 (Xarolla means &#8220;top of the hill&#8221;) with a second story added in 1791. This was the last mill to serve the public in Malta when steam power made it impractical in 1939-49. It was severely damaged by storms in 1970 and was abandoned until 1996 when the city restored it and eventually converted it into a small museum in 2004.

The cap and vanes are absent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Verdala Palace<\/strong>, Siggiewi. This palace is on the east limits of the town of Siggiewi. It was built in 1586. The site originally had a hunting lodge in the <i>Boschetto<\/i>, a large semi-landscaped area that was used by knights of the Order of Saint John for game hunting. It was further embellished in the 17th and 18th centuries.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">During the French blockade of 1798\u20131800, the palace served as a military prison for French soldiers captured by the Maltese or British. During British rule, it became a silk factory, but it was eventually abandoned and fell into a state of disrepair but was fully restored 1850s. \u00a0It subsequently became the official summer residency of the Governors of Malta. At the outbreak of World War II in 1939, works of art from the National Museum were stored at the palace for safekeeping. The palace was restored in 1982 and began to be used to host visiting heads of state.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Since 1987, the Verdala Palace has been in use as the summer residence of the\u00a0President of Malta, and it is generally closed to the public except for the August Moon Ball held annually in aid of the\u00a0Malta Community Chest Fund.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.ca\/url?sa=i&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;ved=&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Flecrac.blogspot.com%2F2014%2F09%2Fverdala-palace.html&amp;psig=AOvVaw0RLDpdewuwVMhTLZH7GVWA&amp;ust=1551742068684896\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwjIztvxj-fgAhXMjqQKHdd2DA4QjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-QM1TPAR8wwY\/U2fBgZnqypI\/AAAAAAAAD6A\/ci97yBerPew\/s1600\/digiScanLtd.com+Graham106.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Verdala Palace,\" width=\"530\" height=\"353\" data-iml=\"1551655681078\" \/><\/a><\/span><br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>I then drove north to my hostel, Inhawi Hostel in St Julian. With a high Hostelworld rating, it is a lovely place occupying an old school. A dorm room was 13 E including breakfast.

Either follow the sandy road to the right as you come up the hill or follow the tarmac road until you get to the bungalow on the top. You still will not be able to see anything more apart from the limestone Quarry to the South. Walk west away from the house towards the telephone pole. Head north on the main path, then west to reach the main cart ruts at Clapham Junction. It is thought that the ruts were formed especially after rains when the limestone is 80% softer.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The cave complex is a series of interconnecting caves next to Clapham Junction ruts. The cave even has cart ruts going into it. The cave complex consists of 8 smaller caves on two levels surrounding a large natural cavern whose roof has collapsed. The residents inhabited the smaller caves building stone walls inside and at the entrance. There is some wall paintings, loops in the ceiling, ducts, shelves and niches.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Inhabited from prehistoric times until 1835, their best description is from a visit by a Jesuit in 1637. The cave ceiling had openings to let light in and smoke out, keeping efficient ventilation, while rain could not penetrate their living area. These Troglodytes decorated their walls and ceilings with bunches of herbs, garlic and onions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Dingli Cliffs.<\/strong> The south side of the island is rural and lined by 200m high cliffs especially prominent in the middle near the high point of the island where the Parish Dome and communication towers are. Below the road are quaint villages and then the perpendicular plunge into the Mediterranean. The cliffs stretch for a few kilometres and are white sedimentary limestone. Some caves on the edges and the cliff face served as hideaways to escape pirates. The farmers used to climb or descend into the caves employing ladders, pull them in during the night and disguise the entrance with rubble walls or tree branches. Some with easier access were permanently inhabited and later on, used as shelters for herds.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The view includes the islet of Filfla \u2013 a nature reserve \u2013 that contains faunal and floral endemic species. Up to a few years ago, this islet was a shooting target for the British Military to test the accuracy of its equipment and to train personnel. The size of Filfla was reduced drastically through this practice.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Diawara Waterfall.<\/strong> If you walk along the cliffs, you come to a small bay Ras-id-Dawwara, at Wied Ghar Ilma, at the head of which is a small waterfall, a real rarity in Malta, that depending on rainfall from November to April, a small stream flows over the edge falling into the ocean above a sea cave. I could not find this as there was no waterfall.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Megalithic Temple and Punio Roman Remains at Ras Ir-Raheb.\u00a0<\/strong>I made finding this a real walkabout, but one that was very enjoyable &#8211; complete solitude in a wonderful natural setting. I didn&#8217;t pay much attention to the map and so turned left heading for all the eroded cliffs and a wide bench just above the water. As there were no remains here, I returned and followed the coast to the end of the peninsula staying left of all the Private signs. Right at the tip were some ancient stone foundations and two standing stones.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Mgarr.<\/strong> Another NM &#8220;small town&#8221; of dubious significance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>RABAT<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>St. Paul\u2019s Catacombs<\/strong>\u00a0are some of the most prominent features of\u00a0Malta\u2019s\u00a0early Christianity\u00a0archaeology. The archaeological clearing of the site has revealed an extensive system of underground galleries and tombs dating from the third to the eighth centuries CE.<sup>. <\/sup>There are over 30\u00a0hypogea\u00a0in the entire St. Paul&#8217;s and St. Agatha\u2019s complex<sup>[<\/sup>, over 20 are open to the public.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">They are part of a large cemetery once located outside the walls of the ancient Greek city of\u00a0Melite, now covered by the smaller\u00a0Mdina\u00a0and Rabat. It also comprises the catacombs of\u00a0Saint Agatha, San Katald, St. Augustine and many others.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The cemetery probably originated in the Phoenician-Punic period. As in Roman tradition, Phoenician and Punic burials were located outside city walls. The many tombs discovered in areas outside the known line of the Roman city suggest that the city of Melite was close to equal size.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The early tombs consisted of a deep rectangular shaft with one or two chambers dug from its sides. This type of burial was used well into the Roman occupation of the islands, but the chambers grew larger and more regular in shape over time. It is probable that this enlargement joined neighbouring tombs and led to the creation of small catacombs, which became the norm by the fourth century AD. The catacombs were in use till the seventh, possibly eighth century. Some of the catacombs were used again during the re-Christianisation of the Island around the 13th century.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The main complex, covering an area of more than 2000 square metres, is so far the largest catacomb on the island. It is large enough to have served as a communal burial ground in successive phases of Malta\u2019s history. The two halls at the bottom of the entrance stairs show two\u00a0agape tables (circular tables hewn out of the rock\u00a0and used for ceremonial meals commemorating dead relatives).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Although the complex contains almost all of the burial types found in the Maltese repertoire, the best represented are so-called\u00a0baldacchino tombs. These free-standing, canopied burials dominate the main corridors of the complex; their four elegant arches and supporting pillars are exemplary. Other decorations within this catacomb include illustrations and written messages in red paint.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Another catacomb is much smaller than the first. The surgical tools carved in relief on one of the three blocking stones in the inner chamber suggest that it was the burial place of a particular family or group of surgeons. The 24 catacombs show evidence of\u00a0Christian,\u00a0Pagan\u00a0and\u00a0Jewish\u00a0burials side-by-side and no visible divisions. \u20ac2.50 reduced<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Parish Church of St. Paul.<\/strong> Like many of the parish churches, this has limited opening times, apparently 5-9 am and 5-7 pm.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Wignacourt Museum<\/strong> (Grotto of St Paul).

A suburb began to develop outside its walls by the 15th century, and this area now forms the historic core of Victoria. The castle&#8217;s defences were obsolete by the 16th century, and in 1551 an\u00a0Ottoman\u00a0force\u00a0invaded Gozo\u00a0and sacked the Cittadella.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A major reconstruction of the southern walls of the Cittadella was undertaken between 1599 and 1622, transforming it into a gunpowder fortress.

The battery remained an active military installation until its guns were removed by the British in 1954. It was restored and opened to the public in the early 21st century, and it is now equipped with eight working replicas of SBBL 32-pounders which fire gun signals daily at 1200 and 1600.

Only 10 people are allowed in every hour and 80\/day and depending on the time of year reservations book out months ahead. The normal adult price is 40 euros, booked early it is 20 euros for seniors. At slow times of the year, there are last-minute tickets available at the site, but none of the reductions apply. I arrived on March 6 at 10 am and got one of the last tickets for noon the next day.<br \/>\nThe tour is given totally by an audio guide. The small size of the groups is dictated by the small size of the viewing areas.<br \/>\n<\/em>This is an underground burial necropolis first discovered by a stone mason laying foundations to build some houses on the summit of a hill in Paola, not far from the harbour. Most of the houses had been built by the time excavations could begin (they lasted until 1911) and much damage was done to the top level.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Around 3500 BC, some natural cavities were adopted to deposit the bones of the dead in mass burials (the flesh had been allowed to decay first). As the cavities filled up, two lower levels were created by chiselling out the soft limestone rock along natural fault lines using stone, flint and animal antlers. The carving was done to look like normal architecture with faux columns and curved corbels of decreasing diameter on the ceilings, and most is finely done. It is thought that about 7000 people were eventually buried over the next 1000 years. Then the civilization disappeared for unknown reasons. Because of the high humidity, the bones decayed and disintegrated when touched so all that was left was basically dust in large heaps &#8211; only a few bones survived. The environment of the complex is now carefully controlled &#8211; humidity, temperature, carbon dioxide and light &#8211; to prevent deterioration. Early on this was not done and the walls were soon covered with algae. The price reflects the cost of maintaining that environment.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a class=\"irc_mutl i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=i&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;ved=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sloweurope.com%2Fcommunity%2Fmedia%2Fmodel-of-hal-saflieni-hypogeum.7848%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw3y7eDcuF8VddK6VSLQsoUZ&amp;ust=1552059474455250\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwih5cewr_DgAhXK16QKHQslDxMQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mut\" src=\"https:\/\/encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR6LqWs77SthNLZ07u77VprURrjZP1idxAeo-ARd6DOY-RIJpWx\" alt=\"Image result for HAL SAFLIENI HYPOGEUM\" width=\"601\" height=\"353\" data-iml=\"1551973378571\" \/><\/a><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Model of the entire complex<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The complex has three levels:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Upper level<\/strong> (3600-3300 BC).
