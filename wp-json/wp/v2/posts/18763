I got Google Mapped as it took a very direct route, first on a winding road, the Bairnsdale-Dargo Road C601 and after Dargo a narrow paved road that climbed up slowly with a lot of construction. I groaned when I hit gravel through Alpine National Park, basically on the top of the world here &#8211; the Dargo High Plains road. Of variable quality, it lasted 48 km, changed to paved and finally joined the Great Alpine Highway which now looked like a freeway. It descended on a very winding road for many km until Harrietville and finally levelled out at Bright, a gorgeous town with big trees lining the highway.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>ALBURY-WODONGA<br \/>\n<\/strong>Albury is very pretty with buildings from the 1850s and a lot of Art Deco.

I stopped early as all the sites in Wagga were closed and I had a lot of catching up to do, especially my Nauru visa (finally paid for using Wise where I found a CA$30).<br \/>\nMileage: 339 km<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 58<\/strong>\u00a0Thur Nov 16<br \/>\n<strong>WAGGA WAGGA<br \/>\nMuseum of the Riverina<\/strong>. In the old city council chambers (lovingly restored in the museum), there are exhibits on feral dogs and cats, and old photos demonstrating land use climate change, and the effect of agriculture. There were also many astrophotography photos, apparently from some competition (they were very good). Free<br \/>\n<strong>Wagga Wagga Botanic Gardens.<\/strong> Possibly the least inspiring BG I have seen &#8211; mostly brownish grass, trees, and a rose garden. Free<br \/>\n<strong>RAAF Wagga Heritage Centre.<\/strong> 9 km east of Wagga, this is on an airforce base (and staffed by soldiers) with many photos and vignettes of pilots (often with their donated gear). Profile of the Beaufighters, pilots flying a specific plane. Female soldiers and WWII history along with all the other wars Australia has gotten involved in with the US. Technical school. There are 5 planes outside &#8211; one bomber (the Canberra built in Australia) and four fighters. Free<\/p>\n<p><strong>Dog on the Tuckerbox,<\/strong> Gundagai. A 1932 monument at a roadside store\/restaurant, it is a nondescript black dog sitting on a green tuckerbox (lunchbox) on a double stone plinth in the middle of a hexagonal pool. The inscription says &#8220;PIONEER MONUMENT GUNDAGAI&#8221; &#8220;EARTH&#8217;S SELF UPHOLDS THIS MONUMENT TO CONQUERERS WHO WON HER WHEN WOOING WAS DANGEROUS AND NOW ARE GATHERED UNTO HER AGE&#8221;<br \/>\nThe story goes: In the 1850s, Bill the Bullocky, a teamster on the road to Gundagai was crossing 9-Mile Creek with his bullock team and wagon and became hopelessly stuck. On trying to pull the wagon out, the wagon yoke broke. To top it off, his dog was &#8220;on strike&#8221; sitting on his tucker box. The other bullockies thought the incident was a great joke. Bowyang Yorke penned a poem about the incident in 1857 and the story spread. A song was written in 1937 and became very popular. (I personally don&#8217;t get the joke &#8211; only Australians do?)<br \/>\n3000 people attended the unveiling of the small monument and government ministers attended the 50th and 75th anniversary of the original unveling (plaques attest to this). Throw money into the pond for good luck with the proceeds going to the hospital.<br \/>\nThe drive here was throgh endless what field and in the rolling hills, pasture. I think this is one of the prettiest parts of Australia with all the golden grass and wheat, individual trees on a hilly landscape.<br \/>\nON Wayside between Wagga Wagga and Canberra.

It is deep white sand, about 200 m long, and a lovely day area with many tables.<\/p>\n<p><b>Meroogal,<\/b> Nowra. Built in 1886, for the Thorburn family whose 4 generations of descendants (the Macgregors) lived in it until 1985, it is a two-story Victorian house with verandahs, original hardwood floors, a servants wing and many mementoes of the family. It remains in good condition with some of the original furniture. The property is much smaller than the original and the gardens are 1\/10th the size of the original. Free<\/p>\n<dl><\/dl>\n<p><strong>Berry.<\/strong> Small Town<br \/>\n<strong>Nan Tien Temple,<\/strong> Berkeley. A Buddhist temple dedicated to Avalakutesvaia Bodhisattva.

It is near the large breakwater. An art installation of many small white &#8220;pyramids&#8221; is between the two batteries.\u00a0<strong><br \/>\nIllawarra Museum.<\/strong> In the old post office, this is a history museum for Wollongong and Illawarra. It has a classroom (desks sit 2 per desk), a magneto telephone, many historical photos of Wollongong and Illawara, many old artifacts, blacksmiths, old carriages (with plastic horses), laundry, kitchen, a homestead house, a bedroom and sitting room upstairs. Free<br \/>\n<strong>Wollongong Art Gallery.<\/strong> In the old city council chambers, there are 4 stories of local art, watercolours and a wide assortment of techniques. There is a good Holocaust exhibit with vignettes of many of the people who helped Jews escape. I got into a discussion with the curator of this about Israel and Palestine.<br \/>\n<strong>Science Space.<\/strong> I dislike these as they are so kid-orientated. I arrived 20 minutes before closing and the young woman at the desk let me in without paying. True to form, there was little here of interest to adults (except maybe a video on the space station). $16, reduced $14 but free.<br \/>\n<strong>Wollongong Botanic Garden.<\/strong> Very large, the north end is mostly a large area of grass and some big trees. Two creeks run down the center producing a lovely temperate rainforest. Other gardens are succulent, and arid, with palms, many beds of bushes and flowers with a fairly large pond. Very nice. Free<br \/>\n<strong>Wollongong Breakwater Lighthouse.<\/strong> Built in 1937, it is 25 m tall and has always been automated. Sitting on Flagstaff Hill at a sharp point, the water below is a boiling mass over the rocks. Made of reinforced concrete, it is a lovely Art Deco design with arches at the bottom, narrow vertical ribs extending most of the length, and a geometric design on the band below the light.<br \/>\nSeveral people insist on feeding seagulls with a hundred frantic birds. The lady next to my car was feeding them with the birds shitting all over my car. I told her to stop feeding the birds bread. &#8220;it&#8217;s not bread, it&#8217;s chips&#8221;!!!!!<br \/>\nON In the lovely lot just below the lighthouse.

On the seaside road on the way to Sydney, this is a 605 m-long bridge built on piers separated from the steep rock wall to avoid rock falls. It was built over a previous coal colliery and rocky shore of the ocean in 2004-5 using 60,000 tons of rock to build the sea level access and 11,000 cubic metres of cement. The piers are protected from corrosion using an impressed electrical current. Many people park and walk the bridge. It is 21 km north of Wollongong and quite out of the way.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CAMPBELLTOWN<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>St John the Evangelist Catholic Church,<\/strong> Campbelltown. Built in 1836, this all-brick church has a steep A-frame-like roof, nice stained glass on the sides and a rose window.<br \/>\n<strong>The Australian Botanic Garden Mount Annan<\/strong>. A huge garden with only Australian plants is seen by driving on a one-way narrow 30km\/hr road. See the Woodland garden, plant bank and Herbarium (many greenhouses), bottlebrush garden, wattle garden, banksia garden, and red gum gardens, each with special plantings. Each garden has a large parking area and picnic shelters. Several paved paths are for walking and cycling. Free<br \/>\n<strong>Rotary Observatory,<\/strong> Campbelltown. These are two tiny domes on a small hill surrounded by a park-like setting in a residential neighbourhood. Owned by the University of Western Sydney, they were built in 2000 for the Sydney Olympics. There is no information and they couldn&#8217;t be visited. One has the label &#8220;Laser and Illumination Lab&#8221;.<br \/>\n<strong>Mount Gilead Mill,<\/strong> Gilead:\u00a0\u00a0 The windmill at the Mt Gilead property on Appin Road was built by Thomas Rose in 1836. The mill tower, which is built from sandstone quarried on the property, is 60 feet in height, comprises four stories, and is reputed to have contained the finest millstones in the colony. No metal was used in its construction and all the moving parts were fashioned from ironbark grown on the property. The tapering stone tower was topped by a moveable cap made of wood (as the sails had to be always facing into the wind, the moveable cap carried the sails and driving shaft). A stone wall surrounded the windmill, to protect animals from touching the rotating sails.<br \/>\nMount Gilead is the last remaining tower mill in New South Wales.<br \/>\n<strong>Camden Museum of Aviation,<\/strong> Harrington Park.

Inside is a gaudy blue with calligraphy in the dome and one wall. Unusually, the mihrab is in a corner, covered in tiles with a stair minbar.<br \/>\n<strong>Parramatta Hospital Archaeological Site.<\/strong> Vestiges of the Past. Initially a tent hospital in 1790, the Parramatta District Hospital was built in 1818 as a colonial hospital, a 2-story building with 4 wards (men and women were separated). Each ward was 30 m X 6 m with 2.4 m high ceilings and was described as overcrowded, dark and damp with dysentery common. Going here was described as a death sentence. Many died. It served convicts who built the community of Rose Hill (name later changed to Parramatta).<br \/>\nFrom 1848-1902, it was the Parramatta District Hospital (with no convicts), from 1896-1901, the Sulman Power Cottage and in the 1950s, Jeffrie House.<br \/>\nThe site is a large glass and metal frame rectangle with the foundation walls exposed and three glass cases with archaeological findings.<br \/>\n<strong>Woolpack Hotel. Parramatta.<\/strong> Originating in 1796, it is the oldest continuously operating bar in Australia (one in Hobart might argue). Three stories on the corner and one story on the sides. Now has a casino (slot machines), a nice bar and a restaurant. Historic photos in the dining room &#8211; one says &#8220;The Birthplace of Bowls in New South Wales&#8221;. Supposedly there are rooms but I didn&#8217;t ask.<br \/>\n<strong>Elizabeth Farm<\/strong>, Rosehill. Dating from 1793, it is the oldest surviving homestead in Australia. Today there is a stone 2-story house (painted yellow) with furniture as period as possible, an outside kitchen, and a work shed. The gardens are lovely. On either side is the Elizabeth Reserve, a park with grass and trees.<br \/>\n<strong>Gallipoli Mosque<\/strong>, Auburn. A grand mosque with two minarets and a &#8220;wedding cake&#8221; design in 5 layers ascending to the 8 small silver domes and finally a large silver dome. Inside is a riot of calligraphy and design lining the dome (red\/green stained glass and round white stars in red circles), walls and columns. A balcony goes all the way around. The minbar is very tall. It has a youth centre on the side.<br \/>\n<strong>Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway.<\/strong> This is a gorgeous tribute built in 1996. Large marble storyboards, each relating a stage of battle on the tract, line a cement walkway in a very nice long park bordering a river. In the center is a semicircle of three marble walls with incised pictures. I read about 10 but still find it very confusing as there were so many retreats and advances by both sides. Basically, the Japanese were using the track (starting in Kokoda) to capture Port Moresby with the Australians eventually preventing them from doing so.<br \/>\nI saw the Kokoda Tract cemetery outside Port Moresby (read about the battles there).<br \/>\nON In the lovely parking area of the Kokoda Track Memorial. The Rotary has built a lovely covered area with 6 picnic tables, a BBQ, bathrooms and an Education Centre. This may have been the nicest overnight spot in all of Australia.

The area gets its name from the blue haze which is caused by sunlight and fine droplets of eucalypt oil from the trees, dispersed into the atmosphere.

Turn 2 km past the town turnoff to the Wentworth Falls Overlook. From the overlook, a multitude of trails begin. Most walk down the falls trail and return, about 1 hour return. Here is the best route: Walk down the waterfall trail and cross the bridge below two small cascades. Continue to the National Pass trail and take the lower route that goes to a spectacular ledge that just gives a view of the main waterfall, that braids over a huge cliff. Return and walk down to the Fletcher&#8217;s Lookout which gives a view of the top of this main fall. Continue on the Under the Ledge trail, a fairly flat trail that passes several overhangs. Turn right to go up the Prince&#8217;s Rock trail and the lookout that gives a full-on view of the entire lower falls.

Giant Stairway is a lot of stairs, 25 minutes to Dardanelles Pass, a ridge about halfway.<br \/>\nThe heath on the clifftops appears to be pruned manually but is pruned by the wind to a uniform height and provides cover to a variety of birds and small mammals.

Built in 1815, it (along with at least two others I&#8217;ve visited) advertises itself as the oldest pub in Australia. Its name was changed to the Royal Hotel from 1874-1961. There are lots of photos, old advertisements and odd lists on the walls of the bar, lounge, and dining room. The Bistro restaurant was extremely popular on a Sunday with a long lineup to order. Seating in the lounge, dining room and outside. I returned in the late afternoon to eat (chicken schnitzel with mushroom sauce A$22).<br \/>\n<strong>Australia Pioneer Village.<\/strong> It has loads of buildings moved from the area &#8211; bank, school, general store, church, farm machinery shed, many cottages dating from 1815 to the 1930s and several activities, most orientated to kids: animal feeding, spinning, butter churning, clothes washing, dress ups. $10, reduced $5.<br \/>\n<strong>Cattai Homestead Windmill.<\/strong> This is hard to find and took a lot of driving and research on Google. Google Maps is of no help. Cattai is very rural, has no town and only several large houses on acreages. I drove about 6 km through hoping to see a windmill. I then Googled it and the Arndell&#8217;s Windmill comes up on Wiseman&#8217;s Ferry Road (the road I was on!!) in Cattai National Park, off to the north of Wiseman&#8217;s Ferry Road. It was the subject of archaeological research by the University of Sydney.<br \/>\nDr Thomas Arndell (1753-1821) retired from Parramattai Hospital in 1794 and was granted 240 hectares of land here in 1804 when he started the construction of a mill and granary (considered to be the first industrial building in Australia). The 4 m tall stone mill was also known as the convict&#8217;s mill as it was convicts who owned it. The mill was used as a safe place during floods. The area was known as &#8220;the granary of the colony&#8221; as it produced so much wheat. He started to build his homestead in the park in 1820 but died in 1821 at the age of 69. By 1829, the mill no longer appeared in farm accounts or inventories. By the 1850-60s, the mill, granary and homestead had fallen into disrepair. Floods and rust were an issue with the failure of the area for grain farming and it is mostly used for grazing now.<br \/>\nThe Arndell homestead is on Arndell Trail, the main and only road in Cattai NP that ends at a campground. It is a fairly modern house that looks like it was built well after 1900. The house was renovated in the 1930s by adding two wings. I looked all over the Arndell Homestead but could see no obvious evidence of a windmill other than a 4 m circle of bricks off one corner of the house.<br \/>\nI Googled it again and it appears that the derelict windmill is on Hope Farm (the only part of the NP not open to the public). Hope Farm doesn&#8217;t show but Hope Farm Road shows on Google Maps. Dating from 1804, it is the earliest industrial site in Australia.<br \/>\nBy the time I had figured all this out, it was almost 8 and after sundown. I returned to the campground for the night. It is very odd &#8211; a huge lovely park of grass and some large trees along the Hawksbuty River. There are several lovely covered picnic tables but only for day use. The camping area is at the north end and has no tables. I drove to the very back where there was a large shelter, a double barbecue, a new stainless counter and sink (get water by pushing the blue button), and a big table with no benches and too high to sit at. Next is a gorgeous bathroom with 5-minute hot showers &#8211; I had one. Apparently the park gets a lot of use on weekends but there were only two camping here on a Sunday night. A lot of the park is fenced off as it was flooded in 2021.<br \/>\nI counted well over 100 kangaroos along Arndell Trail and in the park.<br \/>\nON Cattai NP campground. $8 for a day entry to the park. I moved my table and chairs under the shelter, the lights came on and I had a great place to stay. No black flies!!! but a ton of small moths that were so irritating that I had to put on my head net. Then the small ants and two types of beetles crawled all over everything. TIA.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 68<\/strong>\u00a0Mon Nov 27<br \/>\n<em>After breakfast and a leisurely start, I drove back outside the park, turned left and then down Hope Farm Road. The road has a locked gate and I walked down it alongside a power line (caved in by fallen trees) 10 minutes to the farm. There are two houses here, both unoccupied but with no evidence of a mill. I walked down a grassy trail for a long way but still did not see the mill.<br \/>\nI Googled it again and the National Trust (Hawkesbury branch) and emailed them nt.hawkesbury@gmail .com. The windmill is closed to the public and can only be seen on tour with the National Trust in Hawkesbury. It is a 4WD trip. The last time they did a tour was in 2019. <\/em><em>Looking at the map, if I would have continued on a trail called the Mill Trail, I may have found it.<\/em><em><br \/>\nThe road I continued on. when out of the park and driving north went along the river on the opposite side of the river. From the map on the NT site, I had the location marked and went down a side road and actually got a view of the mill \u2013 a ruin with only a back wall still standing prominently on a small hill. I had a closer look with my binoculars. So even though it is an impossible NM site to see, because I spent so much time and effort trying to find it, I am going to count it, even if I didn\u2019t get that close.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Richmond Vale Railway Museum,<\/strong> Richmond Vale.

Free<br \/>\n<strong>Nobbys Lighthouse.<\/strong> Originally an island called Whibaygan, then Coal Island, its top was reduced from 62 m high to 28 m for stone to construct Macquaries Pier between 1818-1846 creating a breakwater for Newcastle Harbour and that connected the island to the mainland. The name was changed to Nobbys and the light was built in 1857. Walk along the pier between sand dunes and a surf beach (which appeared only after the breakwater was built) to a path that goes up the hill to the LH &#8211; closed except on Saturdays, Sundays and on cruise ship days.<br \/>\nThe port was dredged from 5.6 m deep to 17 m to allow larger ships to enter. It handles 2200 ships a year. In June 1942, a Japanese submarine lobbed 24 shells at the harbour.<br \/>\n<strong>Newcastle Museum.<\/strong> In an old series of brick warehouses, the two exhibits are on transportation (with a locomotive and model ships) and BHP, the huge steel mill in Newcastle that dates to 1917.

Large exhibit on convicts originally bought here in 1821 and who constructed much of the old town shown on several maps and drawings. A quaint large collection of old stuff from dresses (a whole chest of them), printing, dentistry, toys, clocks, the sugar industry (lasted only until the 1830s as the climate was not inducive), marine, a drawing room. Lachlan Macquarie was the first governor of NSW from 1810-21 and there are a lot of things named after him. $5<\/p>\n<p><strong>MacLeay Valley Bridge. <\/strong>A very long elevated four-lane bridge over the Macleay River floodplain \u2013 most in pasture and fields with the river at the north end.<strong><br \/>\nSmoky Cape Light House.<\/strong> Called Smoky Cape by Cook in 1771 as the Aboriginals had lit fires. The 1891 Lighthouse is a lovely octagon with a black balcony and the original Fresnel lens. It is the highest LH in NSW at 128 m above the ocean. The views in both directions are grand \u2013 a huge sweeping beach to the south and a small beach and headlands to the north. There are three cottages below for rent. In Hat Head NP.

The beds had a lot of densely packed bushes and flowers (a nice hydrangea garden). I walked all over the entire place. Free.<br \/>\n<strong>Seely Lookout Forest Sky Pier.<\/strong> A six km drive up into the hills west of town, this is a large deck built out over the cliff and suspended by a cable suspension system. There are 270-degree views of Coffs Harbour.

For a short time after rain, they are quite spectacular. It is a lovely wide waterfall dropping off into a large pool. The falls are a result of a lava flow from Mt Ebor that rose 600 m over its 1 million year existence. There is a great parking area and picnic site here.

In northeast New South Wales are Barrington Tops National Park, Dorrigo National Park, Mount Warning National Park, New England National Park, Oxley Wild Rivers National Park, Washpool National Park, Willi Willi National Park and Werrikimbe National Park.<br \/>\nWhen Australia separated from Antarctica following the breakup of Gondwana, new asymmetrical continental margins parallel to the coastline eroded resulting in the Great Divide and the Great Escarpment. Volcanoes erupted in sequence along the east coast during the Cenozoic Era as the Australian continental plate moved over one of the planet\u2019s hot spots resulting in the Tweed, Focal Peak, Ebor, and Barrington volcanic shields. Ongoing geological and biological processes produced marked biological diversity with ancient origins in Gondwana, many only found here.<br \/>\nThe Tweed Shield erosion caldera is possibly the best-preserved erosion caldera in the world, notable for its size and age, has a prominent central mountain mass (Wollumbin\/Mt Warning), and shows all three stages in the erosion of the caldera floor to basement rock.<br \/>\nFurther south, the remnants of the Ebor Volcano also show ongoing erosion of a shield volcano.<br \/>\nIncluded are the oldest of the world\u2019s ferns from the Carboniferous Period, Conifers from the Jurassic Period (Araucarians are the most ancient and phylogenetically primitive of the world\u2019s conifers). Angiosperms include primitive flowering plants originating in the Early Cretaceous, the primary radiation of dicotyledons in the mid-Late Cretaceous, rainforests from the \u2018golden age\u2019 of the Early Tertiary, and Miocene vegetation, the antecedent of modern temperate rainforests in Australia.<br \/>\nMany songbirds: lyrebirds, scrub-birds, treecreeper, bowerbirds, and catbirds (some of the oldest lineages of passerines that evolved in the Late Cretaceous).<br \/>\nPlants and animals show relatively recent evolution. The rainforests provide a series of distinctive habitats showing an endpoint in climatic and geomorphological evolution. The distances between these \u2018islands\u2019 of rainforests represent barriers to the flow of genetic material for those taxa that have low dispersal ability. This pressure has created the potential for continued speciation. More than 270 threatened species as well as relict and primitive taxa.<br \/>\nRainforests covered most of Australia for much of the 40 million years after its separation from Gondwana. These contracted as climate changed and the continent drifted northwards. By European arrival, rainforests covered only 1% with suitable climatic and protection from fire. Clearing for agriculture has resulted in only a quarter of the original remaining.<br \/>\nProtected are the largest and best stands of rainforest habitat, rare and threatened flora and fauna species that are rainforest specialists, a diverse range of heaths, rocky outcrop communities, forests, and woodlands. A high diversity of plants and animals in a habitat for rare threatened, and endemic species. Recently found and thought to be extinct: the Hastings River Mouse and Parma Wallaby.<br \/>\nThe Gondwana Rainforests contains the largest and most significant remaining stands of subtropical rainforest and Antarctic Beech in cool temperate rainforests in the world, the largest warm temperate rainforest, and one of only two remaining large areas of Araucarian rainforest in Australia.<br \/>\nSmall size and reasonable proximity with connecting corridors of semi-natural habitats and buffers make intensive management possible.<br \/>\n<strong>My Experience.<\/strong> In my drive through NSW Western and Central, I went through several National Parks included in this serial listing: Dorrigo NP, , Guy Fawkes River NPOxley Wild Rivers NP, Giltralter NP and Wishpool NP.
