The following is an extract from a detailed analysis done in January 2024 and published in Nomad Mania.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Interest in visiting every country began in the 1990s. By 2000, almost 20 had done so. Many were members of Traveler\u2019s Century Club (TCC), so most were American.<br \/>\nNomad Mania sorts UN Masters by year of completion.<\/p>\n<p>By 2008, 55 from 16 nationalities had reached the goal. 62% were white, male and over 50; 91% were white and male. By 2010, the number started to increase with 12 travellers reaching 192. South Sudan became independent in 2011, making 193. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">There was an average of 10 per year up to 2015. There were 15 in 2016 and 47 in 2019.<br \/>\nCOVID in 2020 reduced the number to 12, most before mid-March, 11 in 2021 and after COVID, 50 in 2023. The mix of ethnicities, ages and profiles has been considerably more diverse since 2008.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Since then, three travellers have visited every country twice \u2013 Gunnar Garfors, Slawek Muturi and Harry Mitsidis. The 80-year-old Spaniard Juan Luis Galatas was missing North Korea. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Nomad Mania makes an incredible effort to record them all. Some are missed. A poll conducted by NM in 2022 helped set standards for what constitutes a visit. Visits to the DMZ for North Korea or the Golan Heights for Syria, airport transits or simply stepping across a border don\u2019t count even though Guinness and the TCC have accepted such visits. If everyone who claimed to visit 193 is included, there were 356 as of December 31, 2023. Of these, 30 \u2018transited\u2019 countries, 25 are deceased and 30 are \u201cword of mouth\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>COUNTRIES of UN MASTERS<br \/>\n<\/strong>The United States has 119 UN masters and 45 countries have at least one.
