(Lat. 49.7666, Long. 117.0855) Oct 5, 2014 by Steve Miros<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\"> Pontiac Peak is located in the NE corner of Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park, surrounded by beckoning mountain tops. Though our main destinations in this area are usually Silver Spray Cabin and Woodbury Hut, Pontiac Peak is their equal for a day hike, including some easy scrambling and route-finding.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The area has a significant history dating back to the 1890s of mining the Scranton\/Pontiac\/Sunrise\/Sunset vein system. Its many remains still exist today. This includes a great miners&#8217; trail up to Sunset Lake. The fairly significant Scranton Mine operated into the late 70s. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The Scranton Mine provided for my first foray into Kokanee Glacier Park. An old-timer mining uncle of mine lured me to the area with a first-time helicopter ride into the Scranton Basin to shovel off the heavy snow load from the bunkhouses. Needless to say Waldo and I weren\u2019t too sure of what we\u2019d gotten ourselves into considering we\u2019d have to get out on our own. But a one-way helicopter ride seemed to more than justify some snow shovelling and a cross-country ski out. We had no clue about backcountry skiing and it wouldn\u2019t have helped anyway as neither of us knew how to ski. It probably wasn\u2019t all that bad as I repeated the foray, with another friend of course, about a month later.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Fast forward 40 years. The Sunset Lake Trailhead is accessed by driving 12 km up the Woodbury Creek FSR. Parking for the Scranton Mine\/Sunset Lake trailhead is at the junction where the road splits to the Silver Spray\/Woodbury trailhead parking lot.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The well-marked access road to Sunset Lake trailhead\/Scranton Mine is grown in for all but ATVers. You can see occasional glimpses of Pontiac Peak slightly up ahead and to the right. This roadbed section is rather long (about 4 km), but the pleasant miners trail up to Sunset Lake and beyond, more than makes up for it.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">A park sign marks the trail off the grown-in road and a well-built foot bridge provides access across Pontiac Creek. Someone, probably a fisherman, maybe a parks crew, has cleared the deadfalls. Once you reach Sunset Lake, which has several nice camping spots, the trail follows the east shore while at the same time gradually ascends to the mines further up.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Pontiac Peak is behind (a part of) the ridge south of the lake. Though on a well-established trail base, the underbrush and lack of maintenance are taking an increasing toll on this section of the trail. Once you reach a mine at the foot of a minor headwall, the trail turns south (over the mine shaft) where it meanders south along an agreeable ramp overlooking Sunset Lake. Eventually, you reach another small mine from where you can easily pick your way up the stream bed to the col above. At the col, the route is to go right up the small ridge a short distance, stay below, and work your way along the base of the ridge face. It is not necessary to drop into the basin as there is a narrow ramp allowing you to work your way along the ridge base. Once past the narrow section, it\u2019s an easy scramble on boulders and dirt in a southwesterly direction to the summit.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">When we arrived at the summit it became engulfed in fog on what was supposed to be a sunny weekend. The fairly good shape summit register was deposited by Ron Perrier and Ross Scott in 1998. The summit had seen several visits of KMCers. After lunch and more waiting, the fog cleared to about 8000 ft allowing us to get oriented amongst the surrounding mountains. Riondel is visible from the summit. Views of the Woodbury Hut area and the mountains east of Kootenay Lake were great. Kane Peak is at the doorstep of Pontiac thereby providing a very different vantage point. It might also form a long day ascent route. Kokanee Glacier likewise. The Woodbury Hut\/Silver Spray Hut traverse is slightly discernible to the north. All in all, we spent a great long time at the summit and had a pleasant descent.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">We returned via the same route arriving at the truck by 6 pm (left vehicle at about 9 am). A triple header with a car camp at the various trailheads would be a great way to visit the area.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Eliane &amp; Steven Miros<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>PONTIAC PEAK\u00a0 \u00a02505m\u00a0 \u00a08219&#8242; Pontiac Peak is on the east side of the park south of the head of Woodbury Creek, at the head of Pontiac Peak (Scranton Basin).
