At Km1, turn right on the Chatter Creek spur road for 3.5 km. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">A rough skid trail leads to the edge of the cut block and from there, it is a very steep bushwack due east around cliffs, through patches of devil&#8217;s club, stinging nettles and a scramble up a major rock slide to the snow line at 6,000ft. From here the slope decreased, the tree cover became more sparse and the soft snow cover increased. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">After four hours of climbing and 3,825 ft of elevation gain, we reached the summit of 7,050ft. (GPS 49d 48.282, 116d 48.108). The climb was worth the effort with stunning and seldom-seen viewpoints of Mount Loki and Riondel. Looking to the south southeast up the Tam O&#8217;Shanter Creek valley and beyond Plaid Lake we could see Haystack Mountain (8,596 ft.), some 26 miles away. We built a small cairn at the summit, left our names to identify our personal achievements and commenced a three-hour descent. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Although this mountain does not have an official designation and will never appear in the &#8220;Peakbaggers Almanac&#8221; or a &#8220;Don&#8217;t Waste Your Time&#8221; hiking book, it is the most visible peak from Riondel and has been on my &#8220;FH Peak List&#8221; for more than 20 years. The name &#8220;sardine&#8221; was first observed in a 1930s photo album prepared by a resident hiker\/photographer\/mining engineer Peter Fowler. Some say the name may have originated from the fact that sardines were the most popular and perhaps only hikers&#8217; lunchtime snack.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Terry Turner<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SARDINE MT\u00a0 \u00a02149m\u00a0 \u00a07,050\u2019 A mountain with trees and a character-building bushwhack to the top.
