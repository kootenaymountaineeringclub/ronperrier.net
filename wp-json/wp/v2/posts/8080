The special features of this park include the chain of picturesque small lakes, old growth forest and an example of forest succession. It is\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">known for warm water and is popular with the local communities.\u00a0<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"parkFeature\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Established in 1955.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">1,452 hectares.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Unusual diversity of vegetation from cedar\/hemlock forest to Alpine spruce.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Champion 3rd Lake is stocked with rainbow trout and is a host for Family Fishing Day in June. Powered boats are not allowed on any of the three lakes. Campground &#8211; 95 drive-in campsites, 44 reserved, closed October 1-May 16, but rest of park open.<br \/>\nLocated in south-central BC, access to this park is 6 km north-east of Fruitvale off Highway 3B or 8 km west of the junction of Highway 3 and 3B. From the turn-off, it\u2019s a 12 km, 20-min drive to the park entrance.\u00a0<\/span><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div class=\"parkFeature\">\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>History:<\/strong> In the early 1900s, the area belonged to The Columbia and Western Railway but reverted to the crown in 1919. During the 30s and 40\u2019s the local rod and gun club stocked the lakes and improved trails to allow access for recreational purposes. The park was established in 1955 and the lakes and creek are named for James W. Champion, an early settler and orchardist of the area. Champion Lakes Park lies in the Ktunaxa\/Kinbasket, Okanagan and Sinixt First Nation traditional territories.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Conservation:<\/strong> Champion Lakes Park is located adjacent to the Bonnington Range of the Selkirk Mountains. This 1426-hectare park lies in the moist Interior cedar-hemlock biogeoclimatic zone, which accounts for the varied plant species that grow in some profusion in its well-developed lake-marsh-dry land successional sites. Conifers such as alpine fir and yellow pine, which do not normally grow in the same vicinity, may be seen in the park close together. The park also protects old-growth forest. Flowers, trees and shrubs are part of the park\u2019s natural heritage.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Wildlife:<\/strong> This park supports a diverse population of small mammals such as squirrels, chipmunks and porcupines. Moose, deer and bears are occasionally observed. Birds are quite prevalent with nighthawks, woodpeckers, Canada jays, belted kingfishers, western tanagers and Oregon junkos being the most common. Loons, mallards, widgeons and the great blue heron are more likely to be seen early in the season. In spring and fall, migrating waterfowl specifically Canada geese rest on the lakes during their journeys north and south. The park does support sites suitable for painted turtles.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Park users should always be aware of bears and other wildlife in our park environment. Never feed or approach bears or other wildlife. Please view all wildlife from a distance.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"parkFeature\">\n<h4><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Hiking.\u00a0<\/strong>A total of 6.5 km of gentle trails connects the lakes and encompasses the second and third lakes.

It has a 15-vehicle boat\/trailer parking area and vehicles\/trailers can be left overnight. 2nd Lake boat launch is a rustic, gravel single launch site with parking available above the site. The site can accommodate 15 vehicles\/boat trailers. Due to its remoteness, it is not recommended to leave vehicles\/trailers overnight. The shoreline along both boat launches is in its natural state and is therefore not developed for canoes, kayaks or boats to be beached overnight.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Campfires.<\/strong> While campfires are allowed and campfire rings are provided at each campsite, we encourage visitors to conserve wood and protect the environment by minimizing the use of fire and using camp stoves instead.

To preserve vegetation and ground cover, please don\u2019t gather firewood from the area around your campsite or elsewhere in the park (this is a ticketable offence under the\u00a0<em>Park Act<\/em>). Dead wood is an important habitat element for many plants and animals and it adds organic matter to the soil.<br \/>\n<\/span><strong style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Main Beach<\/strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">\u00a0located on the south-west side of the lake near the park entrance is approximately 200 m long with compact sand, grassy areas and a small buoyed wading area.
