This trail goes through a protected Blue Heron bird sanctuary known as the Waldie Island Heron Reserve. No bikes are allowed on this trail and dog-owners are requested to prevent dogs from disturbing birds by keeping them on leash or close by.

The Waldie Island Trail runs through a wildlife reserve and because of ecological sensitivity, is meant for pedestrian traffic only. Signs explain aspects of local history and wetland ecology.

The trails make for ideal early-season walks and a long hiking season due to their low elevation. Interpretive signs installed along two loops link the cultural and natural history of the area with the confluence of the two great rivers. These trails can also be accessed from the Doukhobor Discovery Centre, Russian Bistro, and Kootenay Gallery area which is across from the airport.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> For more ambitious hikers, the campus trails connect to the Trans Canada Trail route to the City of Trail, along the east side of the Columbia River. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Bike and dog-friendly. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> <em>Facilities:<\/em> Washrooms, picnic tables, benches, interpretive signage.
