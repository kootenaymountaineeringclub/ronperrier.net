It is a specific type of the general practice of\u00a0excarnation. It is practiced in the\u00a0Chinese provinces and autonomous regions\u00a0of\u00a0Tibet,\u00a0Qinghai,\u00a0Sichuan\u00a0and\u00a0Inner Mongolia, as well as in\u00a0Mongolia,\u00a0Bhutan\u00a0and parts of India such as\u00a0Sikkim\u00a0and\u00a0Zanskar.\u00a0<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>The locations of preparation and sky burial are understood in the Vajrayana Buddhist traditions as charnel grounds.

There is no need to preserve the body, as it is now an empty vessel. Birds may eat it or nature may cause it to decompose. The function of the sky burial is simply to dispose of the remains in as generous a way as possible (the source of the practice&#8217;s Tibetan name). In much of Tibet and Qinghai, the ground is too hard and rocky to dig a\u00a0grave, and due to the scarcity of fuel and timber, sky burials were typically more practical than the traditional\u00a0Buddhist practice\u00a0of\u00a0cremation. In the past, cremation was limited to high\u00a0lamas\u00a0and some other dignitaries,<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup> but modern technology and difficulties with sky burial have led to increased use by commoners.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><sup id=\"cite_ref-dif_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>Other nations that performed air burial were the Caucasus nations of Georgians, Abkhazians and Adyghe people, in which they put the corpse in a hollow tree trunk.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup><\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"toc\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Tibetan sky burials appear to have evolved from ancient practices of defleshing corpses as discovered in archeological finds in the region.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>\u00a0These practices most likely came out of practical considerations,<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup> but could also be related to more ceremonial practices similar to the suspected sky burial evidence found at G\u00f6bekli Tepe (11,500 years before present) and Stonehenge (4,500 years BP). Most of Tibet is above the tree line, and the scarcity of timber makes cremation economically unfeasible. Additionally, subsurface interment is difficult since the active layer is not more than a few centimetres deep, with solid rock or permafrost beneath the surface.<\/span><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The customs are first recorded in an indigenous 12th-century Buddhist treatise, that is colloquially known as the <i>Book of the Dead,<\/i>\u00a0Tibetan\u00a0tantricism\u00a0appears to have influenced the procedure.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>\u00a0The body is cut up according to instructions given by a lama or adept.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Mongolians traditionally buried their dead (sometimes with human or animal sacrifice for the wealthier chieftains) but the\u00a0T\u00fcmed\u00a0adopted sky burial following their conversion to Tibetan Buddhism under\u00a0Altan Khan\u00a0during the\u00a0Ming Dynasty\u00a0and other banners subsequently converted under the\u00a0Manchu\u00a0Qing Dynasty.<sup id=\"cite_ref-hei_18-0\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Sky burial was initially treated as a primitive superstition and sanitation concern by the\u00a0Communist\u00a0governments of both the\u00a0PRC\u00a0and\u00a0Mongolia; both states closed many temples\u00a0<sup id=\"cite_ref-hei_18-1\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>and China banned the practice completely from the\u00a0Cultural Revolution\u00a0of the late 1960s until the 1980s.\u00a0<sup id=\"cite_ref-nyt_19-0\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>During this period, Sky burials were considered among the Four Olds, which was the umbrella term used by Communists to describe anti-proletarian customs, cultures and ideas. As a result of these policies, many corpses would simply be buried or thrown in rivers. Many families believed the souls of these people would never escape purgatory and become ghosts. Sky burial nonetheless continued to be practiced in rural areas and has even received official protection in recent years. However, the practice continues to diminish for several reasons, including restrictions on its practice near urban areas and diminishing numbers of vultures in rural districts. Finally, Tibetan practice holds that the yak carrying the body to the charnel grounds should be set free, making the rite much more expensive than a service at a crematorium.<sup id=\"cite_ref-dif_7-1\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup><\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div class=\"thumbinner\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/File:Ragbya_carries_corps_from_Lhasa_for_Sky_burial.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"thumbimage\" src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/9\/92\/Ragbya_carries_corps_from_Lhasa_for_Sky_burial.jpg\/300px-Ragbya_carries_corps_from_Lhasa_for_Sky_burial.jpg\" srcset=\"\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/9\/92\/Ragbya_carries_corps_from_Lhasa_for_Sky_burial.jpg 1.5x\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"449\" data-file-width=\"400\" data-file-height=\"288\" \/><\/a>The corpse was carried from Lhasa for sky burial in about 1920<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">For Tibetan Buddhists, sky burial and cremation are templates of instructional teaching on the impermanence of life.\u00a0<sup id=\"cite_ref-GossKlass_17-1\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup><i>Jhator<\/i> is considered an act of generosity on the part of the deceased since the deceased and his\/her surviving relatives provide food to sustain living beings.

In a place with several <i>jhator<\/i> offerings daily, the birds sometimes have to be coaxed to eat, which may be accomplished with a ritual dance. It is considered a bad omen if the vultures will not eat, or if even a small portion of the body is left after the birds fly away. In these cases, it is usually believed that the individual being buried committed so many sins that their body is considered too dirty to eat or that the individual\u2019s family failed to observe proper rituals.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In places where fewer bodies are offered, the vultures are more eager and sometimes have to be fended off with sticks during the initial preparations. Often there is a limit to how many corpses can be consumed at a certain burial site, prompting lamas to find different areas. It is believed that if too many corpses are disposed of in a certain burial site, ghosts may appear.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Ancient\u00a0<strong>Zoroastrians<\/strong> believed the dead body should be put in particular structures to be feasted upon by birds of prey because the burial or burning of the corpses would cause water and soil to become dirty, which is forbidden in the ancient religion. The burial traditions in historical periods are known through archaeological evidence and sacred texts like the Zoroastrians\u2019 Avesta as well as Pahlavi texts. With the recognition of the Zoroastrian religion in Iran, body burial was strictly prohibited and the only way to eliminate the corpses was to place the deceased in rows so their bodies would be feasted upon by birds of prey. In a Zoroastrian religious text, which is a collection of religious rules and instructions, there are references to the ways to treat the bodies of the dead. According to these texts, the dead should be put in structures known as dakhma to be feasted upon by birds of prey, because the burial or burning of the corpses would cause the sacred elements of water, soil, and fire to become dirty and it is forbidden to do so.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">However, according to the researchers, even in Zoroastrian texts, there are indications that a significant number of people opposed the change in funeral practices, which resulted in penalties.
