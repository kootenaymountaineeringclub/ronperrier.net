Their habitat has been<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">shrinking because of agriculture, spreading cities, climate change, and the predation of feral and outdoor cats. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In North America, cats kill 2.4 billion birds every year, a whopping 15% of the songbird population. Each outdoor cat \u2013 even if well fed \u2013 kills more songbirds than pesticides, vehicles, windows, and wind-turbine collisions combined. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Do cats need to be outside? Domestic cats are potential prey for larger cats, like bobcats and cougars, as well as coyote. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Be a responsible cat lover! Do your part to keep cats from killing birds while also keeping them safe. Spay \/ neuter your cats, keep cats indoors or in enclosed areas, and never release or dump cats into the environment. Our shared goal is to have zero feral cats.<strong> \u00a0<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<h1 class=\"main-title md-title sentence-case\">\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">To save birds, should we kill off cats?<\/span><\/h1>\n<div class=\"article__deck\">\n<h2><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Our feline friends are killing billions of birds every year. A fan of both animals believes there are humane solutions<\/span><\/h2>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"article__body__wrap\" class=\"smart-body--article\">\n<div id=\"article__body\" class=\"paragraphs\">\n<div class=\"parsys content\">\n<div class=\"parbase smartbody section has-p text\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">My cat, Bernstein,\u00a0likes bird-watching almost as much as I do. Bernstein is an easygoing three-year-old\u00a0short-haired tabby\u00a0whose other passions include laser pointers, elastic hair bands, and dental floss. And me, I\u2019m a 33-year-old short-haired blond who has always been, petwise, a cat person. Bernstein and I often hang out together in the living room, appreciating the natural order of\u00a0hummingbirds\u00a0and chickadees outside our window.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Bernstein was a tiny kitten, unable to eat or open his eyes, when he was rescued after being abandoned in a barn. (His littermate, Woodward, remains with the journalist friend who rescued them.) He\u2019s one lucky cat\u2014and I\u2019ve wondered if his genial personality might be due, at least in part, to everlasting gratitude for having\u00a0dodged a lifetime of starvation, shelters, and other feral fates.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But no nature or nurture can override the feline instinct, as I was sadly reminded last spring. On a warm afternoon, I let Bernstein onto the patio for some sun. After slinking off for a few minutes, he proudly returned, clutching a ball of feathers: a one-ounce, beautifully shade-dappled\u00a0Swainson\u2019s thrush\u00a0that had just\u00a0flown several thousand miles\u00a0from Central America to Oregon to sing for a mate in my backyard. Dead as a doornail.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I couldn\u2019t blame Bernstein. He was just putting his instincts and ninja skills into practice. Still, as the little thrush went cold in my hands, my heart sank.\u00a0<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Domestic cats pounce on from one billion to four billion birds a year in the lower 48, six billion to 22 billion small mammals, and hundreds of millions of reptiles and amphibians.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"parbase smartbody section has-p text\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Several years ago,\u00a0a team of Smithsonian Institution and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service researchers combined data from dozens of previous studies to estimate, as rigorously as possible, how many birds are killed by cats each year in the contiguous United States.\u00a0Their results were startling. After carefully quantifying cat populations and predation rates (and the uncertainty of both), the scientists calculated that domestic cats pounce on one billion to four billion birds a year in the lower 48 states, as well as 6.3 billion to 22.3 billion small mammals and hundreds of millions of reptiles and amphibians.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">About two-thirds of the bird deaths were attributed to feral cats, living wild. As birds\u2019 total U.S. population at any given moment has been estimated at around 10 billion to 20 billion, that feral cat toll would probably exceed all mortality from window strikes, roadkill, pesticides, pollution, windmills, and all other unnatural causes combined, except habitat loss and possibly climate change\u2014a staggering thought.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Researchers compiled data from multiple studies to estimate the number of birds in the U.S. and Canada killed in a year as a result of human activity. 1,768 million birds killed per year 55\u00a0<span class=\"g-cstyle0\">M power lines, 624 M in building strikes, 213 M cars, 7 M others. There are 764 M stray and owned cats in the world.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"parbase smartbody section has-p text\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Whoa, did that study ruffle fur and feathers! This wasn\u2019t surprising, considering its heady concoction of charismatic animals, life and death, and ungraspable numbers. Some people disbelieved the estimates or relentlessly attacked the scientists for being \u201canti-cat.\u201d Others felt vindicated, if their views fit the new evidence. Media reports pitched cat people against bird people, animal rights advocates against ecologists, and pet owners against academics. One of the researchers cowrote a book,\u00a0<i>Cat Wars<\/i>\u2014which did not exactly smooth things over\u2014and described receiving death threats.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">All this static did not negate the key finding: that when cats are introduced predators\u2014that is, they\u2019re brought into an ecosystem where they prey on native animals but nothing much preys on them\u2014they are a serious source of mortality for birds and other native wildlife.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Follow-up studies have confirmed the scale of the threat. For example,\u00a0the most comprehensive inquiry in Canada, which has fewer total cats than the United States, estimated that 100 million to 350 million birds are taken by cats each year.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"parbase smartbody section has-p text\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The situation is acute yet oddly unfathomable. Everyone knows cats are predators, but until recently the impact of cats on wildlife was barely recognized. Even when presented with raw kill data, many people, including the overwhelming majority of cat owners, still doubt that cats adversely affect wild bird populations. Maybe this reflects our inherent difficulty in reckoning with broad, incremental effects (like, say,\u00a0climate change).<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"parbase smartbody section has-p text\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Or maybe we should all lighten up. No study has definitively linked cat predation to\u00a0<i>mainland<\/i>\u00a0bird population trends (though islands are another story). It\u2019s difficult to isolate one factor for the widespread decline of many birds because numerous other variables are also at work.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cThe status of the world\u2019s birds continues to deteriorate, and even once common birds are vanishing,\u201d says\u00a0a recent report from BirdLife International. It cites\u00a0agriculture\u00a0and\u00a0logging\u00a0as today\u2019s top threats to imperiled species and ranks introduced predators a distant third. In terms of trashing the planet, humans are plainly the worst offenders. And blaming cats only deflects our responsibility onto an animal with no concept of saving the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"section didYouKnow\">\n<div data-pestle-module=\"DidYouKnow\">\n<div class=\"did-you-know did-you-know__theme-dark\">\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"did-you-know__container\">\n<div class=\"did-you-know__title\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">CAT PROLIFERATION, BY THE NUMBERS.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Left unfixed, Oliver and Bella\u2014<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">America\u2019s favorite cat names<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\u2014get frisky by six months old and can produce multiple litters each year, with predictable results.

But there the agreement stops, partly because right now we have no good solutions. Birds aside, feral cats pose all kinds of intractable health, safety, and philosophical dilemmas that have overwhelmed our current systems. No matter how you believe cats should be treated, the world has just too many cats to manage.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">This is, in fact, the most succinct argument for leaving cats alone: We\u2019ll never be able to get rid of them, no matter how hard we try. Long after humankind has faded from this planet, cats will surely be scratching around whatever\u2019s left of it. But if we give up on seemingly unresolvable problems, the world will grow more miserable, not less so. I think we can do better.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Some are already taking action. Cat advocates have widely embraced trap-neuter-return programs, which sterilize feral cats and then return them to the wild. Bird conservation groups mostly oppose this policy, and the animal rights group PETA stands morally against it, but these organizations offer few feasible alternatives beyond keeping cats indoors (an excellent idea). Meanwhile, U.S. animal shelters euthanize more than a million unwanted cats each year, an unpopular solution to the ultimate problem.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Me, I don\u2019t have the answer. But I do have a suggestion. Back when I took Bernstein to be neutered by the local vet, I wish he\u2019d also been microchipped, not as a voluntary add-on but as standard practice. A chip the size of a grain of rice is easier to administer than a blood test, yet microchips are still mostly absent from the domestic cat world.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">We\u2019d have fewer cats at large if all cats were chipped: Lost animals could easily be returned, and abandoned animals could be traced to those who dumped them. I would happily pay a fee for this effort, especially if part of that contribution went toward building up our shelter system or other programs designed to address the feral cat population with proper resources. Even a small, onetime fee for each pet cat in the United States\u2014insignificant against the cost of a lifetime of cat food\u2014could generate billions of dollars. I know it\u2019s not a perfect or complete solution, and a tangle of details would have to be worked out. But regulating cats would be a good start toward mitigating our current feline free-for-all.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"adSlotDynamic-slot bumper--bottom bumper--add-margin \">\n<div class=\"LazyLoad is-visible\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">No one who loves animals wants to leave this kind of legacy.
