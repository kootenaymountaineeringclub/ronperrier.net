ULCCs have been very successful in Europe and the US. As flying within the European continent, especially on long flights, is much cheaper per kilometer than flying across the Atlantic, the trans-Atlantic market was ripe for the picking and this is where some of the new ULLCs entered.<\/p>\n<p>Global deregulation (allows foreign airlines to land anywhere they want in the US), online ticket sales and marketing (eliminates the need for costly ground staff), consolidation among mainline carriers (fares have increased but the number of available seats hasn\u2019t), and better planes (can run longer and leaner \u2013 the Boeing Dreamliner is $15 million cheaper per year to run than comparable older jets) has allowed new entrants into the airline passenger business. Gate staff, catering and aircraft maintenance are outsourced. High utilization keeps the price down to about 6 cents a kilometer.<\/p>\n<p>ULLCs especially in Europe use the smaller cheaper airports available in major cities. This is the airport with cheaper landing fees and thus keeping costs down. Check out which airlines fly into these smaller airports. For example, you can take JetBlue to Long Beach, an airport close to Los Angeles, instead of flying into LAX and, in Europe, Ryanair will fly into Eindhoven, Netherlands instead of Amsterdam airport while Norwegian Airlines flies into the smaller and harder to get to airports in Oslo and Stockholm. It happens throughout the world so always look into where you are flying. But be sure to check out how far the airports are from the city center \u2014 sometimes transportation from the airport to the city can actually make a budget airline more expensive. However, in general, these low-cost budget airlines are a good deal.<br \/>\nThey are best for simple round-trip or one-way flights that require no connections. Connecting to different airports can be an issue. The airports can be in the middle of nowhere so taxi fares can wipe out any savings. Parking may be much cheaper at these secondary airports which may be a significant cost saving if you are driving your own car. Before buying a ticket, figure out which airports are used, how far they are from town, and how you&#8217;ll get to and from them.<br \/>\nThey generally work best when you have time to spare. Factor in travel time to and from the airport, possible long check-in queues and strict check-in deadlines. There may be a required time between connecting flights.<\/p>\n<p>Check luggage limits as they can be as low as 33 pounds. Can you tolerate no-frills service, small seats and steep prices for a limited selection of drinks and food. As you approach your travel dates, the more likely you are to find the best deal on one of the big national airlines which drop their fares to compete at the last moment. So always do some shopping then.<br \/>\nMost are not listed on traditional searches &#8211; use <strong>lowcostairlines.com<\/strong>, <strong>skyeurope.com<\/strong> and <strong>whichbudget.com<\/strong> to find ULCC.<\/p>\n<p><strong>EUROPE<\/strong>. ULCCs control 30% of the market and have expanded the market by making it possible for more people to fly.<br \/>\nAirtraffic.eu &#8211; is by far the best overview.<br \/>\nWhichbudget.com &#8211; has them all.<br \/>\n1. <strong>ryanair.com<\/strong> The original and largest ULCC in Europe. Goes everywhere from everywhere. Uses non-traditional airports. Charges for luggage by the kilo. Ryan sometimes provides shuttles to and from these airports at a cost or you have expensive taxi rides. But if one calculates the lost time, it may not save much money. Ryan once threatened to charge for use of the bathroom but backed down due to the outroar.<br \/>\nTo attack costs and produce fares so low that they create their own demand, Ryan air avoided paying staff to facilitate transfers and investing in non-essential IT infrastructure. Anything that added complexity would have risked making aircraft turnaround times longer. For any low-cost operation, getting planes back into the air as quickly as possible trumps all. If passengers wanted to book two separate flights, they were welcome to do so. But Mr O&#8217;Leary had no intention of holding their hands.<br \/>\nPreviously, the prospect of back-to-back flights with the airline\u2014planning your own connections with no insurance against delays\u2014was positively harrowing. A lot of has changed. Ryan Air has begun airside transfers at London Stansted and Barcelona El Prat airports (2016) \u2013 making it more like a hub and spoke carrier.  With over 100 routes from Stansted, ample opportunities to switch planes are created. Instead of passing through customs and immigration, collecting baggage, and enduring a second round of security screening to catch the next flight (time-consuming, Ryanair is reluctant to guarantee its connection), airside transfers would allow the company to sell through-tickets.<br \/>\nSince 2013, Ryanair has rehabilitated its toxic reputation for customer service &#8211; gone are the punitively high surcharges and obfuscatory booking systems designed to trick customers. In their place are generous baggage allowances, a slick consumer-friendly website, and an ever-obliging social-media persona. The idea is to woo more business travellers with &#8220;Business Plus&#8221;, &#8220;My Ryanair Club&#8221;, a frequent-flyer programme and now booking multi-city tickets.<br \/>\nAll travellers will benefit: search Marrakech to Edinburgh, for example, and Ryanair.com comes up blank. Most comparison websites follow suit, instead suggesting expensive over-night connections. Only by breaking up the journey into two stages\u2014Marrakech to London, and London to Edinburgh\u2014that Ryanair and Stansted emerge as the clear first choice, offering cheap transfers with a short layover.<br \/>\nEventually transfers with full-service carriers at their respective hubs will start. A provisional deal has already been struck with Norwegian Air for long-haul transfers through Scandinavia. Interlining, whereby airlines table complementary flight schedules to swap passengers, is another of the practices historically avoided by Ryanair for reasons of complexity.<br \/>\n2. <strong>wizzair.com<\/strong> \u2013 Hungarian, good for eastern Europe.
