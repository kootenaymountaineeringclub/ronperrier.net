Shellfish plus crab dunked in garlic butter for starters with an Australian Chardonnay. Followed by BBQ&#8217;d salmon, an array of sliced tomatoes, Bocconcini cheese and red onions along with foccaccia bread dipped in balsamic vinegar and olive oil.<br \/>\nAfter scavenging for seafood, start a small fire below the tide line and set a BBQ grill on rocks about 6 inches above the coals to start cooking. <\/p>\n<p><strong>1. FOILED FISH<\/strong><br \/>\nFor baking fish packets, preheat oven or BBQ to 450\u00b0F or burn campfire to coals. Prepare a double thickness of foil12x24\u201d and brush the center with oil. Each packet will hold two firm fish fillets (5-6 oz each)<br \/>\na. <strong>ASIAN FISH<\/strong><br \/>\n1 c cooked rice, 2 c bok choy coarsely chopped, 2 scallions ch, 2 fish fillets, 1 small can water chesnuts drained or 1 c match-stick daikon, 1 tbsp vegetable oil, 1 tsp grated ginger, 1 clove garlic minced, 2 tsp soy sauce, 2 tsp dark sesame oil, splash chili oil. Fold over foil to make an airtight parcel. Bake 20 minutes<br \/>\nb. <strong>GREEK FISH<\/strong><br \/>\n1 c thinly sliced fennel, 1 small tomato sliced, 8 thin slices red onion, 2 fish fillets, 2 tbsp olive oil, juice 1 lemon, 1 tbsp fresh dill ch, dash salt and pepper.<br \/>\nc. <strong>ORANGETTI FISH<\/strong><br \/>\nPierce a spaghetti squash several times with a large fork. Place in baking dish and cook at 375\u00b0F for ~1hr until flesh tender. Scoop out as much of the \u2018spaghetti\u2019 onto the foil sheets as desired. Top with fish. Sprinkle with fish sauce and \u00bdc shredded carrots. Bake packet 20 minutes.<br \/>\nd. <strong>CATCH OF THE DAY<\/strong><br \/>\nCup the foil around the fish, and sprinkle inside and out of the fish with salt, pepper, garlic, cayenne, butter\/oil and lemon slices. Add 4 T. of wine for each fish. Pull foil edges together and seal, leaving a small air space inside. Cook approximately 1\/2 hour over fire or camp stove.<br \/>\ne. <strong>SALMON<\/strong><br \/>\nStuff with cooked rice that has been lightly sauteed with diced onion, celery and grated carrot with garlic, and lots of lemon slices. Wrap in foil and grill. Or grill on top of a cedar plank that has been soaked in water for a couple of hours. Check every 10 minutes or so. <\/p>\n<p><strong>2. SALMON MARINADE<\/strong><br \/>\nAt home, marinate and freeze the salmon to serve on Day 1. You can also use the marinade with extra-firm tofu. It\u2019s incredible! I usually use the \u201csploosh\u201d method of measuring \u2014so these amounts aren\u2019t precise.<br \/>\n1\/2 cup tamari<br \/>\n1 tbsp maple syrup<br \/>\n1 tbsp lemon juice<br \/>\n1-2 clove garlic,<br \/>\ncrushed 1\u201d ginger, peeled and chopped finely.<br \/>\nIdeally, grill or<br \/>\nStuff salmon with cooked rice that has been lightly sauteed with diced onion, celery and grated carrot with garlic, and lots of lemon slices. Wrap in foil and grill. Or grill on top of a cedar plank that has been soaked in water for a couple of hours. Check every 10 minutes or so.<br \/>\nbarbecue the marinated salmon.<br \/>\nFreezing seems to help the flavour \u2014it\u2019s fabulous. If you don\u2019t have time, fry the salmon in the marinade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. SHELLFISH<\/strong><br \/>\nSet mussels, oysters and clams on top of the grill, along with a small pan of garlic butter to melt. As each shell opens up pour in a touch of wine and simmer for a minute. OR Place a dry cast iron frying pan on the heat and add the shellls. When the juice they contain hits the pan it steams up and creates a smoky taste.<br \/>\na. <strong>CHINA POOT MUSSELS AND CLAMS<\/strong>  Serves 4<br \/>\nScrub and remove byssal threads from 4-5 lbs mussels and\/or clams In a large saute pan (or wide saucepan), bring the following ingredients to a simmer:<br \/>\n2 cups medium white wine<br \/>\n1\/4 cup minced shallots<br \/>\n4 cloves minced garlic<br \/>\n1\/4 cup chopped parsley<br \/>\n1 bay leaf<br \/>\nSimmer 3 minutes. Increase heat to high, add shellfish, cover and cook, stirring once or twice, until shells are opened (4-8 min). Discard any unopened ones. Try this: Add 1 tsp curry powder and sprinkle cooked mussels with chopped cilantro and basil.<br \/>\nb. <strong>BARBEQUED OYSTERS<\/strong><br \/>\nCheck first about red tide\/paralytic shellfish poisoning.<br \/>\nChoose oysters with a cupped shell on one side so they will sit level on the BBQ or grate over coals. Cook till the shells open (usually 15-20 minutes). Open and discard the top shell and add favorite BBQ\/seafood sauce to each oyster. Continue cooking till sauce bubbly and oysters start to shrink. Rotate them frequently. <\/p>\n<p><strong>4. TUNA <\/strong><br \/>\nTuna in a foil pouch is compact and needs no can opener. Check out cafeteria condiments in small pouches &#8211; for &#8216;just enough&#8217; mayonnaise, soy sauce, mustard, etc.<br \/>\na. <strong>TUNA SURPRISE<\/strong> (amounts are per camper)<br \/>\n200g pasta (or 1 box Kraft Dinner)<br \/>\n2 tbsp dried peas<br \/>\n2 tbsp dried corn<br \/>\n\u00bd can tuna<br \/>\n\u00bc &#8211; \u2153 c dried cheese<br \/>\n\u00bd c milk<br \/>\n3 tbsp butter or margarine<br \/>\n20g cheddar grated<br \/>\nAt noon: rehydrate dried vegetables.

FISH TACOS<\/strong><br \/>\n18 corn tortillas<br \/>\nCampers Batter: Combine 1 c pancake mix and \u00be c beer until just blended. Could add lemon or herbs. Water will make a batter crispier and milk will make it more tender. If batter left over, use to make tempura.<br \/>\nFish 2 lbs. Rinse fish and pat dry before dipping in batter. Deep fry in oil for 4-5 minutes until golden brown. Drain on towels and serve hot.<br \/>\nPapaya and Cilantro Salsa: 1 papaya peeled, halved, seeds removed and diced.
