Except for snow or glacier routes, the climbs are largely scrambles. A large healthy glacier exists on the northeast side of Mount Cooper, which is the only peak that exceeds 3000 meters. It is the highest summit in the Selkirks south of the Battle Range and is made of granite. Most of the summits are metamorphic (with some island arc volcanic rocks) and the rock is not of good quality.<\/p>\n<p>Goat Range Provincial Park has been left to return to a natural, undisturbed state for the protection of mountain Caribou and other wildlife. Any access is very difficult and a pure bushwhack.<br \/>\nThe NDP is resetting land management &#8211; when forestry was about the forest and not just cubic meters. BC Liberals opened up the forests and the logging industry has had free reign with savage old-growth logging in critical Caribou habitat. The Goat Range is protected by having no easy access. There is no helicopter access to any Provincial Park.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Maps<\/strong> &#8211; 82K\/3 Rosebery, 82K\/6 Poplar Creek, 82K\/2 Lardeau, 82K\/7 Duncan Lake, 82K\/4 Nakusp, 82K\/5 St. Leon Creek.

A glimpse into the history of the region is given by Richard E. Plewman of Rossland, B. C. (KK 4:10) who stated that \u201ceverything between the Slocan River and the Kootenay-Duncan system had been climbed before 1925\u201d, including Mount Cooper. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The park protects the only natural spawning site of the unique \u201cGerrard\u201d rainbow trout. This wilderness area is critical in maintaining the natural habitat for species such as grizzly bears, mountain goats and mountain caribou. Visitors are asked to employ low-impact techniques.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>ACCESS\u00a0<\/strong>\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Access is described largely peak by peak. Refer to each individual post for driving descriptions. Entry to the southern peaks of the group is from Highway 31A from New Denver to Kaslo. Some of the northern and central summits are approached from near the village of Meadow Creek above the north arm of Kootenay Lake and from the Lardeau River valley. The Poplar Creek and Cascade roads are basically useless for gaining the alpine.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">1.\u00a0<strong>Wilson Creek Road<\/strong> to Wilson Creek Falls and the Hicks Creek Road to Alps Alturas Trail.\u00a0The Mount Dolly Varden-Marten Mountain area has good access from Highway 6 at Rosebery (north of New Denver).\u00a0A road extends up Hamling Creek to the west of Hamling Lakes and the Hamling Lakes Wildlife Management Area.<br \/>\n<strong>2. Poplar Creek Road.<\/strong>\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Poplar Creek Road is within Goat Range Provincial Park and <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">gives access to peaks in both the Lardeau and Goat Groups<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">. The bridge is out before the park (as are all bridges), and the road will be allowed to deteriorate. It was very overgrown in 2015 and<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">\u00a0has very thick alder in the lower 5 km.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">One function of the park is to provide a habitat for grizzly bears with minimal disturbance. Therefore, easy human access is being curtailed by the lack of maintenance of roads. The roads can nevertheless be backpacked.<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">From\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Meadow Creek:\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">25.4 km (15.8 miles) north\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">(when driving north from Meadow Creek, make the left turn outside of town).\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><br \/>\nFrom Gerrard:\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">16.4 km (10.2 miles) south<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>3.
