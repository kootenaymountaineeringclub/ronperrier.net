What are\u00a0<em>The Atlantic<\/em>\u2019s tips and tricks? They are soap.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Consider the norovirus, a real terror of a pathogen, just a couple dozen nanometers in length, with its invasive acids tucked inside a protein coat. Exposure to fewer than 100 particles of norovirus can leave you with several days\u2019 worth of vomiting and diarrhea. Those particles are very, very hard to kill.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Douse them in a squirt of alcohol, and, chances are, they\u2019ll come through just fine. One study looked at a spate of norovirus outbreaks at nursing homes in New England during the winter of 2006\u201307, and found that locations where staff made regular use of hand sanitizers were at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S0196655310009855\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">much\u00a0<em>greater<\/em>\u00a0risk<\/a>\u00a0of experiencing an outbreak than others in the study. Why? Because those other nursing homes were equipped with something better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">They had soap.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Research finds that soap is good at cleaning things. At least 4,000 years of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/bk-2015-1211.ch009\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">history<\/a>\u00a0suggest the same. Soap works because its structure mixes well with water on one end and with oils on the other. The latter, hydrophobic side can hook into, and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/03\/13\/health\/soap-coronavirus-handwashing-germs.html\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">then destroy<\/a>, the membranes that surround some microbes (though norovirus isn\u2019t one of them). Molecules of soap also\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/news.emory.edu\/stories\/2020\/03\/esc_soap_saves_lives\/campus.html\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">cluster up in little balls<\/a>\u00a0that can surround and trap some germy grime before it\u2019s flushed away beneath the tap. And soap, being sudsy, makes washing hands more fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Not everyone endorses washing hands.

Commercial hand sanitizers hardly work. The same is true for quaternary ammonium cations, also known as QACs or \u201cquats,\u201d which are found in many standard disinfecting products for the home. My local gym dispenses antiseptic wipes for cleaning the equipment; these are tissues soaked in benzalkonium chloride, a QAC.

And a lot of what we thought we knew about killing off norovirus has turned out to be misguided. It\u2019s very hard to grow a norovirus in the lab, so for a while, scientists used another virus from the same family\u2014feline calicivirus, which can give a cat a cold\u2014as\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/pesticide-registration\/epas-registered-antimicrobial-products-effective-against-norovirus-feline\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">a stand-in<\/a>\u00a0for their experiments. This was not a good idea. \u201cFeline calicivirus is a wimp compared to human norovirus,\u201d Lee-Ann Jaykus, an expert on food virology at North Carolina State University, told me. Her work has shown, for example, that bleach works pretty well at disinfecting feline virus in the lab, and that the same is true for a mouse norovirus that is often used in these experiments. But when she and colleagues tested human-norovirus samples drawn from patients\u2019 fecal specimens, the particles seemed\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/ars.els-cdn.com\/content\/image\/1-s2.0-S0362028X23063123-gr2_lrg.jpg\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">far more resistant<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">You know what works better than hand sanitizers or QACs at getting rid of actual human norovirus?

It\u2019s soap.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Or maybe one should say, it\u2019s washing up with soap. A\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/26518271\/\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">letter<\/a>\u00a0published in\u00a0<em>The<\/em>\u00a0<em>Journal of Hospital Infection<\/em>\u00a0in 2015 by a team of German hygienists followed up on earlier work comparing hand sanitizers with soap and water, and argued that the benefits of the latter were mechanical in nature, by which the hygienists meant that simply rubbing one\u2019s hands together under running water could produce an analogous effect. (They also argued that some kinds of hand sanitizer can inactivate a norovirus in a way that soap and water can\u2019t.) Jaykus\u2019s team has also found that the hand-rubbing part of hand-washing contributes the lion\u2019s share of disinfecting. \u201cIt\u2019s not an inactivation step; it\u2019s a removal step,\u201d she told me. As for soap, its role may be secondary to that of all the rubbing and the water: \u201cWe use the soap to make your hands slippery,\u201d Jaykus said. \u201cIt makes it easier to wash your hands, and it also loosens up any debris.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p id=\"injected-recirculation-link-1\" class=\"ArticleRelatedContentLink_root__VYc9V\" data-view-action=\"view link - injected link - item 2\" data-event-element=\"injected link\" data-event-position=\"2\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/health\/archive\/2023\/02\/norovirus-stomach-flu-outbreak-cases-rising-prevention\/673116\/\">Read: Wash your hands and pray you don\u2019t get sick<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">This is faint praise for soap, but it\u2019s hardly damning.
