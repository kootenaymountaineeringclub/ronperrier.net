For me, the day started with a couple of hours of wind sprints trying, in vain, to keep up with Monsieur LeBel. We reached the Gimli bivi site at 1:20 with me coughing up bits of lung as we stopped for a wee break, as I think Ren\u00e9 feared I was about to have a coronary. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">We continued around to the Gimli-Nisleheim col and descended a short distance down on the north side, from where we traversed to the Nisleheim-Midgard col. From the col we followed Midgard&#8217;s SE ridge up for a bit before skirting around on a cairned ledge on the south side that delivered us to the base of the scramble section of the SE ridge. Here we traversed north across moderate snow to under the middleright of the east face. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The route was easy to find &#8211; the highest snow ended directly below a very obvious light-coloured left-facing corner in the middle right of the face. We scrambled up a short corner that proved harder than it looked \u2013 Ren\u00e9 educated me in the fine art of dry-tooling \u2013 to a big ledge where we had some more food before roping up. Seeing as Ren\u00e9 had the hardest leads of our last two climbs, I gave him the first lead this time as it looked easy. Beautifully clean slabs of wonderfully textured and decorated Valhalla gneiss led to the base of the aforementioned corner, which Ren\u00e9 climbed for 20 m to a belay stance under a big roof \u2013 the pitch was fun, but harder than I thought it had looked. I took over the rack as I looked up at the roof overhead that had suddenly grown to an enormous size \u2013 and I seriously questioned my sense of fair play. Ren\u00e9, the joker he is, told me to get a piece soon as he wasn&#8217;t totally happy with his anchor. I suspect he just wanted to see me whimper (which usually takes far less than such a remark). Luckily for both of us, I did manage to quickly place a tri-cam on this hard-to-protect pitch. A few moves up to the base of the roof, and I was able to traverse left and pick up another left-facing corner. I climbed the enjoyable corner with rock that alternated between solid and compact, and a bit on the loose side, neither of which was conducive to good gear placements. It is amazing how a bit of a run-out can make 5.5 feel considerably harder. I called this the kaleidoscope pitch, as there was an amazing range of colours in the rock; this was probably the first time I&#8217;ve climbed on pyrite. When the corner tilted to the right and began to fade into a gully-like feature, I moved right in the hope of finding some pro and maybe eventually a belay stance. With a little effort, I was able to find both and brought Ren\u00e9 up. The final pitch was enjoyable easy climbing on ledgy terrain, that surprised us both by ending right at the summit cairn. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">It was 2:20, so the trip from the truck had taken us 6:20. I felt a modern rating would probably bump the FA rating of 5.3 up a couple of grades. But I&#8217;ve been called a weenie more than once in the past. We enjoyed an hour on top, studying Asgard trying to psyche ourselves up for another Howie route: the SW ridge. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">We started down the \u201c3rd class\u201d south ridge of Midgard, and as we began to scramble past several rappel stations, we started to wonder if it had been premature to switch back to our mountain boots on the summit. We left the boots on, but did eventually rap a short exposed section using some tat that Ren\u00e9 had harvested higher up. Pretty stiff class 3, I think. The rest of the journey back to the truck passed quickly and without incident. Another very fine day in the Valhallas. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The blow-by-blow of the technical pitches: <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">P1: Start at a large ledge a little above the highest snow that is reached by ascending a tricky left-facing corner (1 point of aid with the ice axe).
