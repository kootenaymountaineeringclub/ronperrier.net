MUSEUM CARDS<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Finland Museum Card<\/strong>. Gives free entry to 280 museums throughout Finland plus 40 in Helsinki for 12 months. Available online and at all included museums.\u00a0\u20ac69<br \/>\nThis is an incredible deal for me as I see so many museums and don\u2019t use the other attractions or restaurants. The only similar country with a museum card for the whole country is the Netherlands that I bought and got at least five times the value.<br \/>\nTheoretically the real card is mailed to you so you would need an address where you could receive the card in 1-3 weeks. I used the temporary card and it worked fine.<br \/>\n<strong>Helsinki Card<\/strong>. Includes free admission to all Helsinki museums plus reduced prices at many attractions but I only use the museum part of the card and it works out to be not as good value for me. Pay more to include travel including to and from the airport (in brackets) &#8211;\u00a0\u20ac42 (54) for 24 hours,\u00a0\u20ac49 (61) for 48 hours,\u00a0\u20ac55 (71) for 72 \u00a0hours.<br \/>\n<strong>2. Finland is a very<\/strong> <strong>civilized<\/strong> country. Almost everyone speaks good English with only a slight accent. They were voted the happiest country in the world in 2018 replacing the Danes who don\u2019t seem happy and certainly aren\u2019t friendly. The few Finns I have met are friendly. Bicycles are common (most wearing helmets) as are people exercising. Garbage cans are rare \u2013 in this way they are very much like Japan where you never see a garbage can \u2013 they make people responsible for their own trash and keep the costs of garbage collection low, but they require a responsible public. Lidl stores (my favourite grocery store) are common. Wifi can often be found free and password free. There are more blonds here than any other country I have been to. The women are not the thin \u201cfashionistas\u201d seen in Eastern Europe where the men prefer very thin women.<br \/>\n<strong>3. Driving and Parking.<\/strong> In Helsinki, one must contend with 3 things: trams are everywhere and usually control the center lane of most roads; the many cyclists complicate driving as it is one more thing to look out for; there are also many battery powered scooters but those are everywhere in Europe; many signs are on large concrete bases that make parking more hazardous. They are nice drivers, considerate and relatively patient. Parking in Helsinki has been very easy. But secondary roads have multiple speed limits and many cameras (I have never seen a country that obeys speed limits like Fins)<br \/>\n<strong>4. Costs.<\/strong> It is certainly more expensive than where I have just come from, Eastern Europe but that is the cheapest part of Europe. Diesel is \u20ac135.9-143.9 (\u20ac133.9 in Tallinn and 125-126 in south Estonia and twice the price in Belarus). Restaurant food is out of sight (pizza is twice what it was in Tallinn). A soft ice cream cone is \u20ac4.50, a doughnut \u20ac3.50. Lidl food prices seem equal to elsewhere in Europe so I will be back to cooking my own meals.<br \/>\nBut the Museum Card will balance everything out. I paid for it on my first day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Currency<\/strong>: Euro\u00a0\u20ac<\/p>\n<p><strong>FERRY \u2013 Tallinn, Estonia to Helsinki. Finland<br \/>\n<\/strong>There are three companies who provide ferry services across the Gulf of Finland. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.laevapiletid.ee\">www.laevapiletid.ee<\/a> is a great web site that pools all three and provides easy comparison of times and costs for the particular day you want to cross. I used Eckero Line and booked the day before for travel on July 9. The 18:30 sailing was the cheapest one at \u20ac53 for a vehicle and one passenger. This was unbelievably cheap and a perfect time for me. Costs seem to go up the closer one is to your sailing date.<br \/>\nAnother advantage of the VW California is ferry costs. At 4.9m long and slightly less than 1.9m high, it qualifies as a car and the cheapest price. The most expensive cost was with Viking at 6am for \u20ac120.<br \/>\nThere is no need to print your ticket. Simply write down your booking number and give it at the check-in booth at the Echero terminal. I had no wait at the booth and luckily moved past all the lines and boarded quickly.<br \/>\nThe crossing takes 2\u00bd hours. As night time is so short at this latitude, I arrived in Helsinki with a couple hours of light.<br \/>\nThe ferry has only lounge and restaurant seating. There were at least 3 bars and one restaurant (buffet \u20ac30). People board and run upstairs to get a seat. I ended up on a narrow stool directly over the stern (arguably the best view on the boat), but could have asked someone to share their table. I had bought a sandwich in town and avoided the ferry costs. There are several video gaming rooms and fast free wi-fi.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SUMMARY<\/strong><br \/>\nFinland (Finnish: Suomi) officially the Republic of Finland is a Nordic country in Northern Europe bordering the Baltic Sea, Gulf of Bothnia, and Gulf of Finland, between Norway to the north, Sweden to the northwest, and Russia to the east. The capital and largest city is Helsinki. Other major cities are Espoo, Vantaa, Tampere, Oulu and Turku.<br \/>\nFinland&#8217;s population is 5.52 million (as of half of 2019. the majority of whom live in the central and south of the country and speak Finnish, a Uralic language unrelated to the Scandinavian languages. Finland is the eighth-largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union. It is a parliamentary republic of 311 municipalities, and one autonomous region, the \u00c5land Islands. Over 1.4 million people live in the Greater Helsinki metropolitan area, which produces one third of the country&#8217;s GDP.<br \/>\nFinland was inhabited when the last ice age ended, approximately 9000\u00a0BCE. The first settlers left behind artefacts that present characteristics shared with those found in Estonia, Russia, and Norway. The earliest people were hunter-gatherers, using stone tools. The first pottery appeared in 5200\u00a0BCE, when the Comb Ceramic culture was introduced. The arrival of the Corded Ware culture in southern coastal Finland between 3000 and 2500\u00a0BCE may have coincided with the start of agriculture. The Bronze Age and Iron Age were characterised by extensive contacts with other cultures in the Fennoscandian and Baltic regions and the sedentary farming inhabitation increased towards the end of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Iron_Age\">Iron Age<\/a>. At the time Finland had three main cultural areas \u2013\u00a0Southwest Finland, Tavastia and Karelia\u00a0\u2013 as reflected in contemporary jewellery.\u00a0\u00a0 `<br \/>\nFrom the late 13th century, Finland gradually became an integral part of Sweden through the Northern Crusades and the Swedish part-colonisation of coastal Finland, a legacy reflected in the prevalence of the Swedish language and its official status. In 1809, Finland was incorporated into the Russian Empire as the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland. In 1906, Finland became the first European state to grant all adult citizens the right to vote, and the first in the world to give all adult citizens the right to run for public office.<br \/>\nFollowing the 1917 Russian Revolution, Finland declared itself independent. In 1918, the fledgling state was divided by civil war, with the Bolshevik-leaning Red Guard, supported by Soviet Russia, fighting the White Guard, supported by the German Empire. After a brief attempt to establish a kingdom, the country became a republic. In World War II, Finland lost parts of Karelia, Salla, Kuusamo and Petsamo to the Soviet Union.<br \/>\nFinland joined the United Nations in 1955 and adopted an official policy of neutrality. The Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948 gave the Soviet Union some leverage in Finnish domestic politics during the Cold War. Finland joined the OECD in 1969, the NATO Partnership for Peace in 1994, the European Union in 1995, the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council in 1997, and the Eurozone at its inception in 1999.<br \/>\nFinland was a relative latecomer to industrialisation, remaining a largely agrarian country until the 1950s. After World War II, the Soviet Union demanded war reparations from Finland not only in money but also in material, such as ships and machinery. This forced Finland to industrialise. It rapidly developed an advanced economy while building an extensive welfare state based on the Nordic model, resulting in widespread prosperity and one of the highest per capita incomes in the world. Finland is a top performer in numerous metrics of national performance, including education, economic competitiveness, civil liberties, quality of life, and human development. In 2015, Finland was ranked first in the World Human Capital and the Press Freedom Index and as the most stable country in the world during 2011\u20132016 in the Fragile States Index, and second in the Global Gender Gap Report. It also ranked first on the World Happiness Report report for 2018 and 2019. A large majority of Finns are members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, and freedom of religion is guaranteed under the Finnish Constitution.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Etymology<br \/>\n<\/strong>The earliest written appearance of the name Finland is thought to be on three runestones. Two were found in the Swedish province of Uppland and have the inscription finlonti. The third was found in Gotland. It has the inscription finlandi and dates back to the 13th century. The name can be assumed to be related to the tribe name Finns, which is mentioned at first known time AD 98.<br \/>\nSuomi.\u00a0The name Suomi (Finnish\u00a0for &#8220;Finland&#8221;) has uncertain origins, but a candidate for a source is the Proto-Baltic word *\u017aem\u0113, meaning &#8220;land&#8221;. In addition to the close relatives of Finnish (the Finnic languages), this name is also used in the Baltic languages Latvian and Lithuanian.<br \/>\nIn the earliest historical sources from the 12th and 13th centuries, the term Finland refers to the coastal region around Turku from Perni\u00f6 to Uusikaupunki. This region later became known as Finland Proper in distinction from the country name Finland. Finland became a common name for the whole country in a centuries-long process that started when the Catholic Church established missionary diocese in Nousiainen in the northern part of the province of Suomi possibly sometime in the 12th century.<br \/>\nThe devastation of Finland during the Great Northern War (1714\u20131721) and during the Russo-Swedish War (1741\u20131743) caused Sweden to begin carrying out major efforts to defend its eastern half from Russia. These 18th-century experiences created a sense of a shared destiny that when put in conjunction with the unique Finnish language, led to the adoption of an expanded concept of Finland.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HISTORY<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Prehistory. <\/strong>If the archeological finds from Wolf Cave are the result of Neanderthals&#8217; activities, the first people inhabited Finland approximately 120,000-130,000 years ago. The area that is now Finland was settled in, at the latest, around 8,500 BCE during the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stone_Age\">Stone Age<\/a> towards the end of the last glacial period. The artifacts the first settlers left behind present characteristics that are shared with those found in Estonia, Russia, and Norway. The earliest people were hunter-gatherers, using stone tools.<br \/>\nThe first pottery appeared in 5200\u00a0BCE, when the Comb Ceramic culture was introduced. The arrival of the Corded Ware culture in Southern coastal Finland between 3000 and 2500 BCE may have coincided with the start of agriculture. Even with the introduction of agriculture, hunting and fishing continued to be important parts of the subsistence economy.<br \/>\nIn the Bronze Age permanent all-year-round cultivation and animal husbandry spread, but the cold climate phase slowed the change. Cultures in Finland shared common features in pottery and also axes had similarities but local features existed. Seima-Turbino-phenomenon brought first bronze artifacts to the region and possibly also the Finno-Ugric-Languages. Commercial contacts that had so far mostly been to Estonia started to extend to Scandinavia. Domestic manufacture of bronze artifacts started 1300 BCE with Maaninka-type bronze axes. Bronze was imported from Volga region and from Southern Scandinavia.<br \/>\nIn the Iron Age population grew especially in H\u00e4me and Savo regions. Finland proper was the most densely populated area. Cultural contacts to the Baltics and Scandinavia became more frequent. Commercial contacts in the Baltic Sea region grew and extended during the 8th and 9th Centuries.<br \/>\nMain exports from Finland were furs, slaves, Castoreum, and falcons to European courts. Imports included silk and other fabrics, jewelry, Ulfberht swords, and, in lesser extent, glass. Production of iron started approximately in 500 BCE.<br \/>\nIn the end of the 9th century, indigenous artifact culture, especially women&#8217;s jewelry and weapons, had more common local features than ever before. This has been interpreted to be expressing common Finnish identity which was born from an image of common origin.<br \/>\nAn early form of Finnic languages spread to the Baltic Sea region approximately 1900 BCE with the Seima-Turbino-phenomenon. Common Finnic language was spoken around Gulf of Finland 2000 years ago. The dialects from which the modern-day Finnish language was developed came into existence during the Iron Age. Although distantly related, the Sami retained the hunter-gatherer lifestyle longer than the Finns. The Sami cultural identity and the Sami language have survived in Lapland, the northernmost province, but the Sami have been displaced or assimilated elsewhere.<br \/>\nThe 12th and 13th centuries were a violent time in the northern Baltic Sea. The Livonian Crusade was ongoing and the Finnish tribes such as the Tavastians and Karelians were in frequent conflicts with Novgorod and with each other. Also, during the 12th and 13th centuries several crusades from the Catholic realms of the Baltic Sea area were made against the Finnish tribes. According to historical sources, Danes waged two crusades on Finland, in 1191 and in 1202, and Swedes, possibly the so-called second crusade to Finland, in 1249 against Tavastians and the third crusade to Finland in 1293 against the Karelians. The so-called first crusade to Finland, possibly in 1155, is most likely an unreal event. Also, it is possible that Germans made violent conversion of Finnish pagans in the 13th century. According to a papal letter from 1241, the king of Norway was also fighting against &#8220;nearby pagans&#8221; at that time.<br \/>\n<strong>Swedish era. <\/strong>As a result of the crusades and the colonisation of some Finnish coastal areas with Christian Swedish population during the Middle Ages, Finland gradually became part of the kingdom of Sweden and the sphere of influence of the Catholic Church. Due to the Swedish conquest, the Finnish upper class lost its position and lands to the new Swedish and German nobility and to the Catholic Church. In Sweden even in the 17th and 18th centuries, it was clear that Finland was a conquered country and its inhabitants could be treated arbitrarily. Swedish kings visited Finland rarely and in Swedish contemporary texts Finns were portrayed to be primitive and their language inferior.<br \/>\nSwedish became the dominant language of the nobility, administration, and education; Finnish was chiefly a language for the peasantry, clergy, and local courts in predominantly Finnish-speaking areas. During the Protestant Reformation, the Finns gradually converted to Lutheranism.<br \/>\nIn the 16th century, Mikael Agricola published the first written works in Finnish. The first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku, was established in 1640. Finland suffered a severe famine in 1696\u20131697, during which about one third of the Finnish population died, and a devastating plague a few years later.<br \/>\nIn the 18th century, wars between Sweden and Russia twice led to the occupation of Finland by Russian forces, times known to the Finns as the Greater Wrath (1714\u20131721) and the Lesser Wrath (1742\u20131743). It is estimated that almost an entire generation of young men was lost during the Great Wrath, due mainly to the destruction of homes and farms, and to the burning of Helsinki. By this time Finland was the predominant term for the whole area from the Gulf of Bothnia to the Russian border.<br \/>\nTwo Russo-Swedish wars in twenty-five years served as reminders to the Finnish people of the precarious position between Sweden and Russia. An increasingly vocal elite in Finland soon determined that Finnish ties with Sweden were becoming too costly, and following Russo-Swedish War (1788\u20131790), the Finnish elite&#8217;s desire to break with Sweden only heightened.<br \/>\nEven before the war there were conspiring politicians, among them Col G. M. Sprengtporten, who had supported Gustav III&#8217;s coup in 1772. Sprengporten fell out with the king and resigned his commission in 1777. In the following decade he tried to secure Russian support for an autonomous Finland, and later became an adviser to Catherine II. In the spirit of the notion of Adolf Ivar Arwidsson (1791\u20131858), &#8220;we are not Swedes, we do not want to become Russians, let us therefore be Finns&#8221;, the Finnish national identity started to become established.<br \/>\nNotwithstanding the efforts of Finland&#8217;s elite and nobility to break ties with Sweden, there was no genuine independence movement in Finland until the early twentieth century. As a matter of fact, at this time the Finnish peasantry was outraged by the actions of their elite and almost exclusively supported Gustav&#8217;s actions against the conspirators. (The High Court of Turku condemned Sprengtporten as a traitor c. 1793.) The Swedish era ended in the Finnish war in 1809.<br \/>\n<strong>Russian Empire era. <\/strong>On 29 March 1809, having been taken over by the armies of Alexander I of Russia in the Finnish War, Finland became an autonomous Grand Duchy in the Russian Empire until the end of 1917. In 1811, Alexander I incorporated Russian Vyborg province into the Grand Duchy of Finland. During the Russian era, the Finnish language began to gain recognition. From the 1860s onwards, a strong Finnish nationalist movement known as the Fennoman movement grew. Milestones included the publication of what would become Finland&#8217;s national epic \u2013 the Kalevala \u2013 in 1835, and the Finnish language&#8217;s achieving equal legal status with Swedish in 1892.<br \/>\nThe Finnish famine of 1866\u20131868 killed 15% of the population, making it one of the worst famines in European history. The famine led the Russian Empire to ease financial regulations, and investment rose in following decades. Economic and political development was rapid. The gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was still half of that of the United States and a third of that of Britain.<br \/>\nIn 1906, universal suffrage was adopted in the Grand Duchy of Finland. However, the relationship between the Grand Duchy and the Russian Empire soured when the Russian government made moves to restrict Finnish autonomy. For example, the universal suffrage was, in practice, virtually meaningless, since the tsar did not have to approve any of the laws adopted by the Finnish parliament. Desire for independence gained ground, first among radical liberals and socialists.<br \/>\n<strong>Civil war and early independence. <\/strong>After the 1917 February Revolution, the position of Finland as part of the Russian Empire was questioned, mainly by Social Democrats. Since the head of state was the tsar of Russia, it was not clear who the chief executive of Finland was after the revolution. The Parliament, controlled by social democrats, passed the so-called Power Act to give the highest authority to the Parliament. This was rejected by the Russian Provisional Government which decided to dissolve the Parliament.<br \/>\nNew elections were conducted, in which right-wing parties won with a slim majority. Some social democrats refused to accept the result and still claimed that the dissolution of the parliament (and thus the ensuing elections) were extralegal. The two nearly equally powerful political blocs, the right-wing parties and the social democratic party, were highly antagonized.<br \/>\nThe October Revolution in Russia changed the geopolitical situation anew. Suddenly, the right-wing parties in Finland started to reconsider their decision to block the transfer of highest executive power from the Russian government to Finland, as the Bolsheviks took power in Russia. Rather than acknowledge the authority of the Power Act of a few months earlier, the right-wing government declared independence on 6 December 1917.<br \/>\nOn 27 January 1918, the official opening shots of the war were fired in two simultaneous events. The government started to disarm the Russian forces in Pohjanmaa, and the Social Democratic Party staged a coup. The latter gained control of southern Finland and Helsinki, but the white government continued in exile from Vaasa. This sparked the brief but bitter civil war. The Whites, who were supported by Imperial Germany, prevailed over the Reds. After the war, tens of thousands of Reds and suspected sympathizers were interned in camps, where thousands died by execution or from malnutrition and disease. Deep social and political enmity was sown between the Reds and Whites and would last until the Winter War and beyond. The civil war and activist expeditions into Soviet Russia strained Eastern relations.<br \/>\nAfter a brief experimentation with monarchy, Finland became a presidential republic, with Kaarlo Juho St\u00e5hlberg elected as its first president in 1919. The Finnish\u2013Russian border was determined by the Treaty of Tartu in 1920, largely following the historic border but granting Pechenga and its Barents Sea harbour to Finland. Finnish democracy did not see any Soviet coup attempts and survived the anti-Communist Lapua Movement. The relationship between Finland and the Soviet Union was tense. Army officers were trained in France, and relations with Western Europe and Sweden were strengthened.<br \/>\nIn 1917, the population was 3 million. Credit-based land reform was enacted after the civil war, increasing the proportion of capital-owning population. About 70% of workers were occupied in agriculture and 10% in industry. The largest export markets were the United Kingdom and Germany.<br \/>\n<strong>World War II and after, <\/strong>Finland fought the Soviet Union in the Winter War of 1939\u20131940 after the Soviet Union attacked Finland and in the Continuation War of 1941\u20131944, following Operation Barbarossa, when Finland aligned with Germany following Germany&#8217;s invasion of the Soviet Union. For 872 days, the German army, aided indirectly by Finnish forces, besieged Leningrad, the USSR&#8217;s second-largest city. After resisting a major Soviet offensive in June\/July 1944 led to a standstill, Finland reached an armistice with the Soviet Union. This was followed by the Lapland War of 1944\u20131945, when Finland fought retreating German forces in northern Finland.<br \/>\nThe treaties signed in 1947 and 1948 with the Soviet Union included Finnish obligations, restraints, and reparations\u2014as well as further Finnish territorial concessions in addition to those in the Moscow Peace Treaty of 1940. As a result of the two wars, Finland ceded most of Finnish Karelia, Salla, and Petsamo, which amounted to 10% of its land area and 20% of its industrial capacity, including the ports of Vyborg (Viipuri) and the ice-free Liinakhamari. Almost the whole population, some 400,000 people, fled these areas. The former Finnish territory now constitutes part of Russia&#8217;s Republic of Karelia. Finland was never occupied by Soviet forces and it retained its independence, but at a loss of about 93,000 soldiers.<br \/>\nFinland rejected Marshall aid, in apparent deference to Soviet desires. However, the United States provided secret development aid and helped the Social Democratic Party, in hopes of preserving Finland&#8217;s independence. Establishing trade with the Western powers, such as the United Kingdom, and paying reparations to the Soviet Union produced a transformation of Finland from a primarily agrarian economy to an industrialised one. Valmet was founded to create materials for war reparations. After the reparations had been paid off, Finland continued to trade with the Soviet Union in the framework of bilateral trade.<br \/>\nIn 1950, 46% of Finnish workers worked in agriculture and a third lived in urban areas. The new jobs in manufacturing, services, and trade quickly attracted people to the towns. The average number of births per woman declined from a baby boom peak of 3.5 in 1947 to 1.5 in 1973. When baby-boomers entered the workforce, the economy did not generate jobs quickly enough, and hundreds of thousands emigrated to the more industrialized Sweden, with emigration peaking in 1969 and 1970. The 1952 Summer Olympics brought international visitors. Finland took part in trade liberalization in the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.<br \/>\nOfficially claiming to be neutral, Finland lay in the grey zone between the Western countries and the Soviet Union. The YYA Treaty (Finno-Soviet Pact of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance) gave the Soviet Union some leverage in Finnish domestic politics. This was extensively exploited by president Urho Kekkonen against his opponents. He maintained an effective monopoly on Soviet relations from 1956 on, which was crucial for his continued popularity. In politics, there was a tendency of avoiding any policies and statements that could be interpreted as anti-Soviet. This phenomenon was given the name &#8220;Finlandization&#8221; by the West German press.<br \/>\nDespite close relations with the Soviet Union, Finland maintained a market economy. Various industries benefited from trade privileges with the Soviets, which explains the widespread support that pro-Soviet policies enjoyed among business interests in Finland. Economic growth was rapid in the postwar era, and by 1975 Finland&#8217;s GDP per capita was the 15th-highest in the world. In the 1970s and 80s, Finland built one of the most extensive welfare states in the world. Finland negotiated with the European Economic Community (EEC, a predecessor of the European Union) a treaty that mostly abolished customs duties towards the EEC starting from 1977, although Finland did not fully join. In 1981, President Urho Kekkonen&#8217;s failing health forced him to retire after holding office for 25 years.<br \/>\nFinland joined the European Union in 1995 and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007<br \/>\nFinland reacted cautiously to the collapse of the Soviet Union, but swiftly began increasing integration with the West. On 21 September 1990, Finland unilaterally declared the Paris Peace Treaty obsolete, following the German reunification decision nine days earlier.<br \/>\nMiscalculated macroeconomic decisions, a banking crisis, the collapse of its largest trading partner (the Soviet Union), and a global economic downturn caused a deep early 1990s recession in Finland. The depression bottomed out in 1993, and Finland saw steady economic growth for more than ten years. Like other Nordic countries, Finland decentralised its economy since the late 1980s. Financial and product market regulation were loosened. Some state enterprises have been privatized and there have been some modest tax cuts. Finland joined the European Union in 1995, and the Eurozone in 1999. Much of the late 1990s economic growth was fueled by the success of the mobile phone manufacturer Nokia, which held a unique position of representing 80% of the market capitalization of the Helsinki Stock Exchange.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GEOGRAPHY<br \/>\n<\/strong>Lying approximately between latitudes 60\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 N, and longitudes 20\u00b0 and 32\u00b0 E, Finland is one of the world&#8217;s northernmost countries. Of world capitals, only Reykjav\u00edk lies more to the north than Helsinki. The distance from the southernmost point \u2013 Hanko in Uusimaa \u2013 to the northernmost \u2013 Nuorgam in Lapland \u2013 is 1,160 kilometres (720\u00a0mi).<br \/>\nFinland has about 168,000 lakes (of area larger than 500\u00a0m2 or 0.12 acres) and 179,000 islands. Its largest lake, Saimaa, is the fourth largest in Europe. The Finnish Lakeland is the area with the most lakes in the country. The greatest concentration of islands is found in the southwest, in the Archipelago Sea between continental Finland and the main island of \u00c5land.<br \/>\nMuch of the geography of Finland is a result of the Ice Age. The glaciers were thicker and lasted longer in Fennoscandia compared with the rest of Europe. Their eroding effects have left the Finnish landscape mostly flat with few hills and fewer mountains. Its highest point, the Halti at 1,324 metres (4,344\u00a0ft), is found in the extreme north of Lapland at the border between Finland and Norway. The highest mountain whose peak is entirely in Finland is Ridnit\u0161ohkka at 1,316\u00a0m (4,318\u00a0ft), directly adjacent to Halti.<br \/>\nThe retreating glaciers have left the land with morainic deposits in formations of eskers. These are ridges of stratified gravel and sand, running northwest to southeast, where the ancient edge of the glacier once lay. Among the biggest of these are the three Salpausselk\u00e4 ridges that run across southern Finland.<br \/>\nHaving been compressed under the enormous weight of the glaciers, terrain in Finland is rising due to the post-glacial rebound. The effect is strongest around the Gulf of Bothnia, where land steadily rises about 1\u00a0cm (0.4\u00a0in) a year. As a result, the old sea bottom turns little by little into dry land: the surface area of the country is expanding by about 7 square kilometres (2.7\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) annually. Relatively speaking, Finland is rising from the sea.The landscape is covered mostly by coniferous taiga forests and fens, with little cultivated land. Of the total area 10% is lakes, rivers and ponds, and 78% forest. The forest consists of pine, spruce, birch, and other species. Finland is the largest producer of wood in Europe and among the largest in the world. The most common type of rock is granite. It is a ubiquitous part of the scenery, visible wherever there is no soil cover. Moraine or till is the most common type of soil, covered by a thin layer of humus of biological origin. Podzol profile development is seen in most forest soils except where drainage is poor. Gleysols and peat bogs occupy poorly drained areas.<br \/>\n<strong>Biodiversity. <\/strong>Phytogeographically, Finland is shared between the Arctic, central European, and northern European provinces of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. According to the WWF, the territory of Finland can be subdivided into three ecoregions: the Scandinavian and Russian taiga, Sarmatic mixed forests, and Scandinavian Montane Birch forest and grasslands. Taiga covers most of Finland from northern regions of southern provinces to the north of Lapland. On the southwestern coast, south of the Helsinki-Rauma line, forests are characterized by mixed forests, that are more typical in the Baltic region. In the extreme north of Finland, near the tree line and Arctic Ocean, Montane Birch forests are common.<br \/>\nSimilarly, Finland has a diverse and extensive range of fauna. There are at least sixty native mammalian species, 248 breeding bird species, over 70 fish species, and 11 reptile and frog species present today, many migrating from neighboring countries thousands of years ago. Large and widely recognized wildlife mammals found in Finland are the brown bear (the national animal), gray wolf, wolverine, and elk. Three of the more striking birds are the whooper swan, a large European swan and the national bird of Finland; the Western capercaillie, a large, black-plumaged member of the grouse family; and the Eurasian eagle-owl. The latter is considered an indicator of old-growth forest connectivity, and has been declining because of landscape fragmentation. The most common breeding birds are the willow warbler, common chaffinch, and redwing. Of some seventy species of freshwater fish, the northern pike, perch, and others are plentiful. Atlantic salmon remains the favourite of fly rod enthusiasts.<br \/>\nThe endangered Saimaa ringed seal, one of only three lake seal species in the world, exists only in the Saimaa lake system of southeastern Finland, down to only 390 seals today. It has become the emblem of the Finnish Association for Nature Conservation.<br \/>\n<strong>Climate. <\/strong>The main factor influencing Finland&#8217;s climate is the country&#8217;s geographical position between the 60th and 70th northern parallels in the Eurasian continent&#8217;s coastal zone. In the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, the whole of Finland lies in the boreal zone, characterized by warm summers and freezing winters. Within the country, the temperateness varies considerably between the southern coastal regions and the extreme north, showing characteristics of both a maritime and a continental climate. Finland is near enough to the Atlantic Ocean to be continuously warmed by the Gulf Stream. The Gulf Stream combines with the moderating effects of the Baltic Sea and numerous inland lakes to explain the unusually warm climate compared with other regions that share the same latitude, such as Alaska, Siberia, and southern Greenland.<br \/>\nWinters in southern Finland (when mean daily temperature remains below 0\u00a0\u00b0C or 32\u00a0\u00b0F) are usually about 100 days long, and in the inland the snow typically covers the land from about late November to April, and on the coastal areas such as Helsinki, snow often covers the land from late December to late March. Even in the south, the harshest winter nights can see the temperatures fall to \u221230\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221222\u00a0\u00b0F) although on coastal areas like Helsinki, temperatures below \u221230\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221222\u00a0\u00b0F) are rare. Climatic summers (when mean daily temperature remains above 10\u00a0\u00b0C or 50\u00a0\u00b0F) in southern Finland last from about late May to mid-September, and in the inland, the warmest days of July can reach over 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F). Although most of Finland lies on the taiga belt, the southernmost coastal regions are sometimes classified as hemiboreal.<br \/>\nIn northern Finland, particularly in Lapland, the winters are long and cold, while the summers are relatively warm but short. The most severe winter days in Lapland can see the temperature fall down to \u221245\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221249\u00a0\u00b0F). The winter of the north lasts for about 200 days with permanent snow cover from about mid-October to early May. Summers in the north are quite short, only two to three months, but can still see maximum daily temperatures above 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F) during heat waves. No part of Finland has Arctic tundra, but Alpine tundra can be found at the fells Lapland.<br \/>\nThe Finnish climate is suitable for cereal farming only in the southernmost regions, while the northern regions are suitable for animal husbandry.<br \/>\nA quarter of Finland&#8217;s territory lies within the Arctic Circle and the midnight sun can be experienced for more days the farther north one travels. At Finland&#8217;s northernmost point, the sun does not set for 73 consecutive days during summer, and does not rise at all for 51 days during winter.<\/p>\n<p><strong>POLITICS<br \/>\n<\/strong>Due to the electoral system of proportional representation, and the relative reluctance of voters to switch their support between parties, the relative strengths of the parties have commonly varied only slightly from one election to another. However, there have been some long-term trends, such as the rise and fall of the Communists during the Cold War; the steady decline into insignificance of the Liberals and its predecessors from 1906 to 1980; and the rise of the Green League since 1983. In the 2011 elections, the Finns Party achieved exceptional success, increasing its representation from 5 to 39 seats, surpassing the Centre Party.<br \/>\nThe autonomous province of \u00c5land, which forms a federacy with Finland, elects one member to the parliament, who traditionally joins the parliamentary group of the Swedish People&#8217;s Party of Finland. (The province also holds elections for its own permanent regional council, and in the 2011 elections, \u00c5land Centre was the largest party.)<br \/>\n<strong>Foreign relations. <\/strong>According to the 2012 constitution, the president (currently Sauli Niinist\u00f6) leads foreign policy in cooperation with the government, except that the president has no role in EU affairs.<br \/>\nIn 2008, president Martti Ahtisaari was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Finland was considered a cooperative model state, and Finland did not oppose proposals for a common EU defence policy. This was reversed in the 2000s, when Tarja Halonen and Erkki Tuomioja made Finland&#8217;s official policy to resist other EU members&#8217; plans for common defence.<br \/>\n<strong>Social security. <\/strong>Finland has one of the world&#8217;s most extensive welfare systems, one that guarantees decent living conditions for all residents: Finns, and non-citizens. Since the 1980s the social security has been cut back, but still the system is one of the most comprehensive in the world. Created almost entirely during the first three decades after World War II, the social security system was an outgrowth of the traditional Nordic belief that the state was not inherently hostile to the well-being of its citizens, but could intervene benevolently on their behalf. According to some social historians, the basis of this belief was a relatively benign history that had allowed the gradual emergence of a free and independent peasantry in the Nordic countries and had curtailed the dominance of the nobility and the subsequent formation of a powerful right wing. Finland&#8217;s history has been harsher than the histories of the other Nordic countries, but not harsh enough to bar the country from following their path of social development.<br \/>\n<strong>Military. <\/strong>The Finnish Defence Forces consist of a cadre of professional soldiers (mainly officers and technical personnel), currently serving conscripts, and a large reserve. The standard readiness strength is 34,700 people in uniform, of which 25% are professional soldiers. A universal male conscription is in place, under which all male Finnish nationals above 18 years of age serve for 6 to 12 months of armed service or 12 months of civilian (non-armed) service. Voluntary post-conscription overseas peacekeeping service is popular, and troops serve around the world in UN, NATO, and EU missions. Approximately 500 women choose voluntary military service every year. Women are allowed to serve in all combat arms including front-line infantry and special forces. The army consists of a highly mobile field army backed up by local defence units. The army defends the national territory and its military strategy employs the use of the heavily forested terrain and numerous lakes to wear down an aggressor, instead of attempting to hold the attacking army on the frontier.<br \/>\nMost conscripts receive training for warfare in winter, and transport vehicles such as this give mobility in heavy snow.<br \/>\nFinnish defence expenditure per capita is one of the highest in the European Union. The Finnish military doctrine is based on the concept of total defence.<br \/>\nEven while Finland hasn&#8217;t joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the country has joined the NATO Response Force, the EU Battlegroup, the NATO Partnership for Peace and in 2014 signed a NATO memorandum of understanding, thus forming a practical coalition. In 2015, the Finland-NATO ties were strengthened with a host nation support agreement allowing assistance from NATO troops in emergency situations. Finland has been an active participant in the Afghanistan and Kosovo. Recently Finland has been more eager to discuss about its current and planned roles in Syria, Iraq and war against ISIL.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ECONOMY<br \/>\n<\/strong>The economy of Finland has a per capita output equal to that of other European economies such as those of France, Germany, Belgium, or the UK. The largest sector of the economy is the service sector at 66% of GDP, followed by manufacturing and refining at 31%. Primary production represents 2.9%. With respect to foreign trade, the key economic sector is manufacturing. The largest industries in 2007 were electronics (22%); machinery, vehicles, and other engineered metal products (21.1%); forest industry (13%); and chemicals (11%). The gross domestic product peaked in 2008. As of 2015, the country&#8217;s economy is at the 2006 level.<br \/>\nFinland has significant timber, mineral (iron, chromium, copper, nickel, and gold), and freshwater resources. Forestry, paper factories, and the agricultural sector (on which taxpayers spend around 3 billion euros annually) are important for rural residents so any policy changes affecting these sectors are politically sensitive for politicians dependent on rural votes. The Greater Helsinki area generates around one third of Finland&#8217;s GDP. In a 2004 OECD comparison, high-technology manufacturing in Finland ranked second largest after Ireland. Knowledge-intensive services have also resulted in the smallest and slow-growth sectors \u2013 especially agriculture and low-technology manufacturing \u2013 being ranked the second largest after Ireland.The o verall short-term outlook was good and GDP growth has been above that of many EU peers.<br \/>\nFinland is highly integrated into the global economy, and international trade produces one third of GDP. Trade with the European Union makes up 60% of Finland&#8217;s total trade. The largest trade flows are with Germany, Russia, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Netherlands, and China. Trade policy is managed by the European Union, where Finland has traditionally been among the free trade supporters, except for agricultural policy. Finland is the only Nordic country to have joined the Eurozone.<br \/>\nFinland&#8217;s climate and soils make growing crops a particular challenge. The country lies between the latitudes 60\u00b0N and 70\u00b0N, and it has severe winters and relatively short growing seasons that are sometimes interrupted by frost. However, because the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Drift Current moderate the climate, Finland contains half of the world&#8217;s arable land north of 60\u00b0 north latitude. Annual precipitation is usually sufficient, but it occurs almost exclusively during the winter months, making summer droughts a constant threat. In response to the climate, farmers have relied on quick-ripening and frost-resistant varieties of crops, and they have cultivated south-facing slopes as well as richer bottomlands to ensure production even in years with summer frosts. Most farmland was originally either forest or swamp, and the soil has usually required treatment with lime and years of cultivation to neutralize excess acid and to improve fertility. Irrigation has generally not been necessary, but drainage systems are often needed to remove excess water. Finland&#8217;s agriculture has been efficient and productive\u2014at least when compared with farming in other European countries.<br \/>\nForests play a key role in the country&#8217;s economy, making it one of the world&#8217;s leading wood producers and providing raw materials at competitive prices for the crucial wood-processing industries. As in agriculture, the government has long played a leading role in forestry, regulating tree cutting, sponsoring technical improvements, and establishing long-term plans to ensure that the country&#8217;s forests continue to supply the wood-processing industries. To maintain the country&#8217;s comparative advantage in forest products, Finnish authorities moved to raise lumber output toward the country&#8217;s ecological limits. In 1984, the government published the Forest 2000 plan, drawn up by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The plan aimed at increasing forest harvests by about 3% per year, while conserving forestland for recreation and other uses.<br \/>\nPrivate sector employees amount to 1.8 million, out of which around a third with tertiary education. The average cost of a private sector employee per hour was 25.1 euro in 2004. As of 2008, average purchasing power-adjusted income levels are similar to those of Italy, Sweden, Germany, and France. In 2006, 62% of the workforce worked for enterprises with less than 250 employees and they accounted for 49% of total business turnover and had the strongest rate of growth. The female employment rate is high. Gender segregation between male-dominated professions and female-dominated professions is higher than in the US. The proportion of part-time workers was one of the lowest in OECD in 1999. In 2013, the 10 largest private sector employers in Finland were Itella, Nokia, OP-Pohjola, ISS, VR, Kesko, UPM-Kymmene, YIT, Metso, and Nordea.<br \/>\nThe unemployment rate was 9.4% in 2015, having risen from 8.7% in 2014. Youth unemployment rate rose from 16.5% in 2007 to 20.5% in 2014. A fifth of residents are outside the job market at the age of 50 and less than a third are working at the age of 61. As of today, nearly one million people are living with minimal wages or unemployed not enough to cover their costs of living.<br \/>\nAs of 2006, 2.4 million households reside in Finland. The average size is 2.1 persons; 40% of households consist of a single person, 32% two persons and 28% three or more persons. Residential buildings total 1.2 million, and the average residential space is 38 square metres (410\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) per person. The average residential property without land costs 1,187 euro per sq metre and residential land 8.6 euro per sq metre. 74% of households had a car. There are 2.5 million cars and 0.4 million other vehicles.<br \/>\nAround 92% have a mobile phone and 83.5% (2009) Internet connection at home. The average total household consumption was 20,000 euro, out of which housing consisted of about 5,500 euro, transport about 3,000 euro, food and beverages excluding alcoholic beverages at around 2,500 euro, and recreation and culture at around 2,000 euro. According to Invest in Finland, private consumption grew by 3% in 2006 and consumer trends included durables, high quality products, and spending on well-being.<br \/>\nIn 2017, Finland&#8217;s GDP reached EUR 224billion. However, second quarter of 2018 saw a slow economic growth. Unemployment rate fell to a near one-decade low in June, marking private consumption growth much higher.<br \/>\nFinland has the highest concentration of cooperatives relative to its population. The largest retailer, which is also the largest private employer, S-Group, and the largest bank, OP-Group in the country are both cooperatives.<br \/>\n<strong>Energy. <\/strong>The free and largely privately owned financial and physical Nordic energy markets traded in NASDAQ OMX Commodities Europe and Nord Pool Spot exchanges, have provided competitive prices compared with other EU countries. As of 2007, Finland has roughly the lowest industrial electricity prices in the EU-15 (equal to France).<br \/>\nIn 2006, the energy market was around 90 terawatt hours and the peak demand around 15 gigawatts in winter. This means that the energy consumption per capita is around 7.2 tons of oil equivalent per year. Industry and construction consumed 51% of total consumption, a relatively high figure reflecting Finland&#8217;s industries. Finland&#8217;s hydrocarbon resources are limited to peat and wood. About 10\u201315% of the electricity is produced by hydropower, which is low compared with more mountainous Sweden or Norway. In 2008, renewable energy (mainly hydropower and various forms of wood energy) was high at 31% compared with the EU average of 10.3% in final energy consumption.<br \/>\nFinland has four privately owned nuclear reactors producing 18% of the country&#8217;s energy and one research reactor at the Otaniemi campus. The fifth AREVA-Siemens-built reactor \u2013\u00a0the world&#8217;s largest at 1600 MWe and a focal point of Europe&#8217;s nuclear industry\u00a0\u2013 has faced many delays and is currently scheduled to be operational by 2018\u20132020, a decade after the original planned opening. A varying amount (5\u201317%) of electricity has been imported from Russia (at around 3 gigawatt power line capacity), Sweden and Norway.<br \/>\nEnergy companies are about to increase nuclear power production, as in July 2010 the Finnish parliament granted permits for additional two new reactors.<br \/>\n<strong>Transport<br \/>\n<\/strong>The extensive road system is utilized by most internal cargo and passenger traffic. The annual state operated road network expenditure of around 1 billion euro is paid with vehicle and fuel taxes which amount to around 1.5 billion euro and 1 billion euro.<br \/>\nThe main international passenger gateway is Helsinki Airport with about 17 million passengers in 2016. Oulu Airport is the second largest, whilst another 25 airports have scheduled passenger services. The Helsinki Airport-based Finnair, Blue1, and Nordic Regional Airlines, Norwegian Air Shuttle sell air services both domestically and internationally. Helsinki has an optimal location for great circle (i.e. the shortest and most efficient) routes between Western Europe and the Far East.<br \/>\nDespite low population density, the Government spends annually around 350 million euro in maintaining 5,865 kilometres (3,644\u00a0mi) of railway tracks. Rail transport is handled by state owned VR, which has 5% passenger market share (out of which 80% are urban trips in Greater Helsinki) and 25% cargo market share. Since 12 December 2010, Karelian Trains, a joint venture between Russian Railways and VR (Finnish Railways), has been running Alstom Pendolino operated high-speed services between Saint Petersburg&#8217;s Finlyandsky and Helsinki&#8217;s Central railway stations. These services are branded as &#8220;Allegro&#8221; trains. The journey from Helsinki to Saint Petersburg takes only three and a half hours. A high-speed rail line is planned between Helsinki and Turku, with a line from the capital to Tampere also proposed.<br \/>\nThe majority of international cargo utilizes ports. Port logistics prices are low. Vuosaari Harbour in Helsinki is the largest container port after completion in 2008 and others include Kotka, Hamina, Hanko, Pori, Rauma, and Oulu. There is passenger traffic from Helsinki and Turku, which have ferry connections to Tallinn, Mariehamn, Stockholm and Travem\u00fcnde. The Helsinki-Tallinn route &#8211; one of the busiest passenger sea routes in the world &#8211; has also been served by a helicopter line,and the Helsinki-Tallinn Tunnel is proposed to provide rail travel between the two cities.<br \/>\n<strong>Industry. <\/strong>Finland was rapidly industrialized after World War II, achieving GDP per capita levels equal to that of Japan or the UK in the beginning of the 1970s. Initially, most development was based on two broad groups of export-led industries, the &#8220;metal industry&#8221; (metalliteollisuus) and &#8220;forest industry&#8221; (mets\u00e4teollisuus). The &#8220;metal industry&#8221; includes shipbuilding, metalworking, the car industry, engineered products such as motors and electronics, and production of metals (steel, copper and chromium). The world&#8217;s biggest cruise ships are built in Finnish shipyards. The &#8220;forest industry&#8221; includes forestry, timber, pulp and paper, and is a logical development based on Finland&#8217;s extensive forest resources (77% of the area is covered by forest, most of it in renewable use). In the pulp and paper industry, many of the largest companies are based in Finland (Ahlstrom, Mets\u00e4 Board, and UPM). However, the Finnish economy has diversified, with expansion into fields such as electronics (e.g. Nokia), metrology (Vaisala), transport fuels (Neste), chemicals (Kemira), engineering consulting (P\u00f6yry), and information technology (e.g. Rovio Entertainment, known for Angry Birds), and is no longer dominated by the two sectors of metal and forest industry. Likewise, the structure has changed, with the service sector growing, with manufacturing reducing in importance; agriculture is only a minor part. Despite this, production for export is still more prominent than in Western Europe, thus making Finland more vulnerable to global economic trends.<br \/>\nIn an Economist Intelligence Unit report released in September 2011, Finland clinched the second place after the United States on Benchmarking IT Industry Competitiveness 2011 which scored on 6 key indicators: overall business environment, technology infrastructure, human capital, legal framework, public support for industry development, and research and development landscape.[139]<\/p>\n<p><strong>PUBLIC POLICY<br \/>\n<\/strong>Finnish politicians have often emulated other Nordics and the Nordic model. Nordics have been free-trading and relatively welcoming to skilled migrants for over a century, though in Finland immigration is relatively new. The level of protection in commodity trade has been low, except for agricultural products.<br \/>\nFinland has top levels of economic freedom in many areas. Finland is ranked 16th in the 2008 global Index of Economic Freedom and 9th in Europe. While the manufacturing sector is thriving, the OECD points out that the service sector would benefit substantially from policy improvements.<br \/>\nThe 2007 IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook ranked Finland 17th most competitive. The World Economic Forum 2008 index ranked Finland the 6th most competitive. In both indicators, Finland&#8217;s performance was next to Germany, and significantly higher than most European countries. In the Business competitiveness index 2007\u20132008 Finland ranked third in the world.<br \/>\nEconomists attribute much growth to reforms in the product markets. According to the OECD, only four EU-15 countries have less regulated product markets (UK, Ireland, Denmark and Sweden) and only one has less regulated financial markets (Denmark). Nordic countries were pioneers in liberalizing energy, postal, and other markets in Europe. The legal system is clear and business bureaucracy less than most countries. Property rights are well protected and contractual agreements are strictly honoured. Finland is rated the least corrupt country in the world in the Corruption Perceptions Index and 13th in the Ease of doing business index. This indicates exceptional ease in cross-border trading (5th), contract enforcement (7th), business closure (5th), tax payment (83rd), and low worker hardship (127th).<br \/>\nFinnish law forces all workers to obey the national contracts that are drafted every few years for each profession and seniority level. The agreement becomes universally enforceable provided that more than 50% of the employees support it, in practice by being a member of a relevant trade union. The unionization rate is high (70%), especially in the middle class (AKAVA\u201480%). A lack of a national agreement in an industry is considered an exception.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TOURISM<br \/>\n<\/strong>In 2005, Finnish tourism grossed over \u20ac6.7 billion with a 5% increase from the previous year. Much of the sudden growth can be attributed to the globalisation and modernisation of the country as well as a rise in positive publicity and awareness. There are many attractions in Finland which attracted over 8 million visitors in 2013.<br \/>\nThe Finnish landscape is covered with thick pine forests and rolling hills, and complemented with a labyrinth of lakes and inlets. Much of Finland is pristine and virgin as it contains 40 national parks from the Southern shores of the Gulf of Finland to the high fells of Lapland. Finland also has urbanised regions with many cultural events and activities.<br \/>\nCommercial cruises between major coastal and port cities in the Baltic region, including Helsinki, Turku, Tallinn, Stockholm, and Travem\u00fcnde, play a significant role in the local tourism industry. Finland is locally regarded as the home of Saint Nicholas or Santa Claus, living in the northern Lapland region. Above the Arctic Circle, in midwinter, there is a polar night, a period when the sun does not rise for days or weeks, or even months, and correspondingly, midnight sun in the summer, with no sunset even at midnight (for up to 73 consecutive days, at the northernmost point). Lapland is so far north that the Aurora Borealis, fluorescence in the high atmosphere due to solar wind, is seen regularly in the fall, winter, and spring.<br \/>\nOutdoor activities range from Nordic skiing, golf, fishing, yachting, lake cruises, hiking, and kayaking, among many others. Wildlife is abundant in Finland. Bird-watching is popular for those fond of avifauna, however hunting is also popular. <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Moose\">Elk<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hare\">hare<\/a> are common game in Finland. Olavinlinna in Savonlinna hosts the annual Savonlinna Opera Festival.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DEMOGRAPHICS<br \/>\n<\/strong>Population by ethnic background in 2017: Finnish (91.33%), Other European (4.90%), Asian (2.50%),\u00a0African (0.90%), Other (0.37%)<br \/>\nThe population of Finland is currently about 5.5 million inhabitants and is aging with the birth rate at 10.42 births per 1,000 population per year, or a fertility rate of 1.49 children born per woman, one of the lowest in the world, below the replacement rate of 2.1, it remains considerably below the high of 5.17 children born per woman in 1887. Finland subsequently has one of the oldest populations in the world, with the average age of 42.6 years. Approximately half of voters are estimated to be over 50 years old.[153][61][154][9] Finland has an average population density of 18 inhabitants per square kilometre. This is the third-lowest population density of any European country, behind those of Norway and Iceland, and the lowest population density in the EU. Finland&#8217;s population has always been concentrated in the southern parts of the country, a phenomenon that became even more pronounced during 20th-century urbanisation. Two of the three largest cities in Finland are situated in the Greater Helsinki metropolitan area\u2014Helsinki and Espoo. Tampere holds the third place while also Helsinki-neighbouring Vantaa is the fourth. Other cities with population over 100,000 are Turku, Oulu, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Kuopio, and Lahti.<br \/>\nAs of 2018, there were 402,619 people with a foreign background living in Finland (7.3% of the population), most of whom are from Russia, Estonia, Somalia, Iraq and Yugoslavia. The children of foreigners are not automatically given Finnish citizenship, as Finnish nationality law practices and maintain jus sanguinis policy where only children born to at least one Finnish parent are granted citizenship. If they are born in Finland and cannot get citizenship of any other country, they become citizens. Additionally, certain persons of Finnish descent who reside in countries that were once part of Soviet Union, retain the right of return, a right to establish permanent residency in the country, which would eventually entitle them to qualify for citizenship. 387,215 people in Finland in 2018 were born in another country, representing 7% of the population. The 10 largest foreign born groups are (in order) from Russia, Estonia, Sweden, Iraq, Somalia, China, Thailand, Serbia, Vietnam and Turkey.<br \/>\nThe immigrant population is growing quite rapidly. By 2035, the three largest cites in Finland will all have a foreign speaking population percentage of over a quarter each, with Helsinki rising to 26%, Espoo to 30% and Vantaa to 34%. The Helsinki region alone will have 437,000 foreign speakers, up by 236,000.<br \/>\n<strong>Language<br \/>\n<\/strong>Finnish and Swedish are the official languages of Finland. Finnish predominates nationwide while Swedish is spoken in some coastal areas in the west and south and in the autonomous region of \u00c5land. The native language of 89% of the population is Finnish, which is part of the Finnic subgroup of the Uralic languages. The language is one of only four official EU languages not of Indo-European origin. Finnish is closely related to Karelian and Estonian and more remotely to the Sami languages and Hungarian. Swedish is the native language of 5.3% of the population (Swedish-speaking Finns).<br \/>\nThe Nordic languages and Karelian are also specially treated in some contexts.\u00a0Finnish Romani is spoken by some 5,000\u20136,000 people.<br \/>\nSami language has an official language status in the north, in Lapland or in northern Lapland, where the Sami people predominate, numbering around 7,000 and recognized as an indigenous people. About a quarter of them speak a Sami language as their mother tongue. The Sami languages that are spoken in Finland are Northern Sami, Inari Sami, and Skolt Sami.<br \/>\nThe rights of minority groups (in particular Sami, Swedish speakers, and Romani people) are protected by the constitution.<br \/>\nThe largest immigrant languages are Russian (1.4%), Estonian (0.9%), Arabic (0.5%), Somali (0.4%) and English (0.4%). English is studied by most pupils as a compulsory subject from the first grade (at seven years of age) in the comprehensive school (in some schools other languages can be chosen instead). German, French, Spanish and Russian can be studied as second foreign languages from the fourth grade (at 10 years of age; some schools may offer other options).<br \/>\n93% of Finns can speak a second language. The figures in this section should be treated with caution, as they come from the official Finnish population register. People can only register one language and so bilingual or multilingual language users&#8217; language competencies are not properly included. A citizen of Finland that speaks bilingually Finnish and Swedish will often be registered as a Finnish only speaker in this system. Similarly &#8220;old domestic language&#8221; is a category applied to some languages and not others for political not linguistic reasons, for example Russian.<br \/>\n<strong>Religion<br \/>\n<\/strong>With 3.9 million members, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland is one of the largest Lutheran churches in the world and is also by far Finland&#8217;s largest religious body; at the end of 2017, 70.9% of Finns were members of the church. The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland sees its share of the country&#8217;s population declining by roughly one percent annually in recent years. The decline has been due to both church membership resignations and falling baptism rates.<br \/>\nThe second largest group, accounting for 26.3% of the population in 2017, has no religious affiliation. The irreligious group rose quickly from just below 13% in the year 2000. A small minority belongs to the Finnish Orthodox Church (1.1%). Other Protestant denominations and the Roman Catholic Church are significantly smaller, as are the Jewish and other non-Christian communities (totalling 1.6%). The Pew Research Center estimated the Muslim population at 2.7% in 2016. The main Lutheran and Orthodox churches are national churches of Finland with special roles such as in state ceremonies and schools.<br \/>\nIn 1869, Finland was the first Nordic country to disestablish its Evangelical Lutheran church by introducing the Church Act, followed by the Church of Sweden in 2000. Although the church still maintains a special relationship with the state, it is not described as a state religion in the Finnish Constitution or other laws passed by the Finnish Parliament. Finland&#8217;s state church was the Church of Sweden until 1809. As an autonomous Grand Duchy under Russia 1809\u20131917, Finland retained the Lutheran State Church system, and a state church separate from Sweden, later named the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, was established. It was detached from the state as a separate judicial entity when the new church law came to force in 1869. After Finland had gained independence in 1917, religious freedom was declared in the constitution of 1919 and a separate law on religious freedom in 1922. Through this arrangement, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland lost its position as a state church but gained a constitutional status as a national church alongside the Finnish Orthodox Church, whose position however is not codified in the constitution.<br \/>\nIn 2016, 69.3% of Finnish children were baptized and 82.3% were confirmed in 2012 at the age of 15, and over 90% of the funerals are Christian. However, the majority of Lutherans attend church only for special occasions like Christmas ceremonies, weddings, and funerals. The Lutheran Church estimates that approximately 1.8% of its members attend church services weekly. The average number of church visits per year by church members is approximately two.<br \/>\nAccording to a 2010 Eurobarometer poll, 33% of Finnish citizens responded that &#8220;they believe there is a God&#8221;; 42% answered that &#8220;they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force&#8221;; and 22% that &#8220;they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force&#8221;. According to ISSP survey data (2008), 8% consider themselves &#8220;highly religious&#8221;, and 31% &#8220;moderately religious&#8221;. In the same survey, 28% reported themselves as &#8220;agnostic&#8221; and 29% as &#8220;non-religious&#8221;.<br \/>\n<strong>Health<br \/>\n<\/strong>Life expectancy has increased from 71 years for men and 79 years for women in 1990 to 79 years for men and 84 years for women in 2017. The under-five mortality rate has decreased from 51 per 1,000 live births in 1950 to 2.3 per 1,000 live births in 2017 ranking Finland&#8217;s rate among the lowest in the world. The fertility rate in 2014 stood at 1.71 children born\/per woman and has been below the replacement rate of 2.1 since 1969. With a low birth rate women also become mothers at a later age, the mean age at first live birth being 28.6 in 2014. A 2011 study published in The Lancet medical journal found that Finland had the lowest stillbirth rate out of 193 countries, including the UK, France and New Zealand.<br \/>\nThere has been a slight increase or no change in welfare and health inequalities between population groups in the 21st century. Lifestyle-related diseases are on the rise. More than half a million Finns suffer from diabetes, type 1 diabetes being globally the most common in Finland. Many children are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The number of musculoskeletal diseases and cancers are increasing, although the cancer prognosis has improved. Allergies and dementia are also growing health problems in Finland. One of the most common reasons for work disability are due to mental disorders, in particular depression. Treatment for depression has improved and as a result the historically high suicide rates have declined to 13 per 100 000 in 2017, closer to the North European average.<br \/>\nThere are 307 residents for each doctor. About 19% of health care is funded directly by households and 77% by taxation.<br \/>\nIn April 2012, Finland was ranked 2nd in Gross National Happiness in a report published by The Earth Institute. Since 2012, Finland has every time ranked at least in the top 5 of world&#8217;s happiest countries in the annual World Happiness Report by the United Nations, as well as ranking as the happiest country in 2018.<br \/>\n<strong>Education and science<br \/>\n<\/strong>Most pre-tertiary education is arranged at municipal level. Even though many or most schools were started as private schools, today only around 3 percent of students are enrolled in private schools (mostly specialist language and international schools), much less than in Sweden and most other developed countries. Pre-school education is rare compared with other EU countries and formal education is usually started at the age of 7. Primary school takes normally six years and lower secondary school three years. Most schools are managed by municipal officials.<br \/>\nThe flexible curriculum is set by the Ministry of Education and the Education Board. Education is compulsory between the ages of 7 and 16. After lower secondary school, graduates may either enter the workforce directly, or apply to trade schools or gymnasiums (upper secondary schools). Trade schools offer a vocational education: approximately 40% of an age group choose this path after the lower secondary school. Academically oriented gymnasiums have higher entrance requirements and specifically prepare for Abitur and tertiary education. Graduation from either formally qualifies for tertiary education.<br \/>\nIn tertiary education, two mostly separate and non-interoperating sectors are found: the profession-oriented polytechnics and the research-oriented universities. Education is free and living expenses are to a large extent financed by the government through student benefits. There are 15 universities and 24 Universities of Applied Sciences (UAS) in the country. The University of Helsinki is ranked 75th in the Top University Ranking of 2010. The World Economic Forum ranks Finland&#8217;s tertiary education No. 1 in the world. Around 33% of residents have a tertiary degree, similar to Nordics and more than in most other OECD countries except Canada (44%), United States (38%) and Japan (37%). The proportion of foreign students is 3% of all tertiary enrollments, one of the lowest in OECD, while in advanced programs it is 7.3%, still below OECD average 16.5%.<br \/>\nMore than 30% of tertiary graduates are in science-related fields. Forest improvement, materials research, environmental sciences, neural networks, low-temperature physics, brain research, biotechnology, genetic technology, and communications showcase fields of study where Finnish researchers have had a significant impact.<br \/>\nFinland has a long tradition of adult education, and by the 1980s nearly one million Finns were receiving some kind of instruction each year. Forty percent of them did so for professional reasons. Adult education appeared in a number of forms, such as secondary evening schools, civic and workers&#8217; institutes, study centres, vocational course centres, and folk high schools. Study centres allowed groups to follow study plans of their own making, with educational and financial assistance provided by the state. Folk high schools are a distinctly Nordic institution. Originating in Denmark in the nineteenth century, folk high schools became common throughout the region. Adults of all ages could stay at them for several weeks and take courses in subjects that ranged from handicrafts to economics.<br \/>\nFinland is highly productive in scientific research. In 2005, Finland had the fourth most scientific publications per capita of the OECD countries. In 2007, 1,801 patents were filed in Finland.<br \/>\nIn addition, 38 percent of Finland&#8217;s population has a university or college degree, which is among the highest percentages in the world.<br \/>\nIn 2010 a new law was enacted considering the universities, which defined that there are 16 of them as they were excluded from the public sector to be autonomous legal and financial entities, however enjoying special status in the legislation. As result many former state institutions were driven to collect funding from private sector contributions and partnerships. The change caused deep rooted discussions among the academic circles.<br \/>\nEnglish language is important in Finnish education. There are a number of degree programs that are taught in English, which attracts thousands of degree and exchange students every year.<br \/>\nIn December 2017 the OECD reported that Finnish fathers spend an average of eight minutes a day more with their school-aged children than mothers do.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CULTURE<br \/>\n<\/strong>Finnish architecture is famous around the world, and has contributed significantly to several styles internationally, such as Jugendstil (or Art Nouveau), Nordic Classicism and Functionalism.<br \/>\nThe people of northern Finland, Sweden, and Norway, the Sami, are known primarily for highly spiritual songs called joik. The same word sometimes refers to lavlu or vuelie songs, though this is technically incorrect.<br \/>\n<strong>Cuisine<br \/>\n<\/strong>Karelian pasty (karjalanpiirakka) is a traditional Finnish dish made from a thin rye crust with a filling of rice. Butter, often mixed with boiled egg (eggbutter or munavoi), is spread over the hot pastries before eating.<br \/>\nFinnish cuisine is notable for generally combining traditional country fare and haute cuisine with contemporary style cooking. Fish and meat play a prominent role in traditional Finnish dishes from the western part of the country, while the dishes from the eastern part have traditionally included various vegetables and mushrooms. Refugees from Karelia contributed to foods in eastern Finland.<br \/>\nFinnish foods often use wholemeal products (rye, barley, oats) and berries (such as bilberries, lingonberries, cloudberries, and sea buckthorn). Milk and its derivatives like buttermilk are commonly used as food, drink, or in various recipes. Various turnips were common in traditional cooking, but were replaced with the potato after its introduction in the 18th century.<br \/>\nAccording to the statistics, red meat consumption has risen, but still Finns eat less beef than many other nations, and more fish and poultry. This is mainly because of the high cost of meat in Finland.<br \/>\nFinland has the world&#8217;s highest per capita consumption of coffee. It also has the highest per capita consumption of milk, at about 1 litre (0.22\u00a0imp\u00a0gal; 0.26\u00a0US\u00a0gal) per day, even though 17% of the Finns are lactose intolerant.<br \/>\n<strong>Public holidays<br \/>\n<\/strong>All official holidays in Finland are established by Acts of Parliament. Christian holidays include Christmas, New Year&#8217;s Day, Epiphany, Easter, Ascension Day, Pentecost, Midsummer Day (St. John&#8217;s Day), and All Saints&#8217; Day, while secular holidays include May Day, Independence Day, New Year&#8217;s Day, and Midsummer. Christmas is the most extensively celebrated, and at least 24 to 26 December is taken as a holiday.<br \/>\n<strong>Sports<br \/>\n<\/strong>Finland&#8217;s men&#8217;s national ice hockey team is ranked as one of the best in the world. The team has won three world championship titles (in 1995, 2011 and 2019) and six Olympic medals.<br \/>\nVarious sporting events are popular in Finland. Pes\u00e4pallo, resembling baseball, is the national sport of Finland, although the most popular sports in terms of spectators is ice hockey. Ice Hockey World Championships 2016 final Finland-Canada, 69% of Finnish people watched that game on TV. Other popular sports include athletics, cross-country skiing, ski jumping, football, volleyball and basketball. While ice hockey is the most popular sports when it comes to attendance at games, association football is the most played team sport in terms of the number of players in the country and is also the most appreciated sport in Finland.<br \/>\nIn terms of medals and gold medals won per capita, Finland is the best performing country in Olympic history. Finland first participated as a nation in its own right at the Olympic Games in 1908, while still an autonomous Grand Duchy within the Russian Empire. At the 1912 Summer Olympics, great pride was taken in the three gold medals won by the original &#8220;Flying Finn&#8221; Hannes Kolehmainen.<br \/>\nFinland was one of the most successful countries at the Olympic Games before World War II. At the 1924 Summer Olympics, Finland, a nation then of only 3.2 million people, came second in the medal count. In the 1920s and 1930s, Finnish long-distance runners dominated the Olympics, with Paavo Nurmi winning a total of nine Olympic gold medals between 1920 and 1928 and setting 22 official world records between 1921 and 1931. Nurmi is often considered the greatest Finnish sportsman and one of the greatest athletes of all time.<br \/>\nFor over 100 years, Finnish male and female athletes have consistently excelled at the javelin throw. The event has brought Finland nine Olympic gold medals, five world championships, five European championships, and 24 world records.<br \/>\nIn addition to Kolehmainen and Nurmi, some of Finland&#8217;s most internationally well-known and successful sportspeople are long-distance runners Ville Ritola and Lasse Vir\u00e9n; ski-jumpers Matti Nyk\u00e4nen and Janne Ahonen; cross-country skiers Veikko Hakulinen, Eero M\u00e4ntyranta, Marja-Liisa Kirvesniemi and Mika Myllyl\u00e4; rower Pertti Karppinen; gymnast Heikki Savolainen; professional skateboarder Arto Saari; ice hockey players Kimmo Timonen, Jari Kurri, Teemu Sel\u00e4nne, and Saku Koivu; football players Jari Litmanen and Sami Hyypi\u00e4; basketball player Hanno M\u00f6tt\u00f6l\u00e4; alpine skiers Kalle Palander and Tanja Poutiainen; Formula One world champions Keke Rosberg, Mika H\u00e4kkinen and Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen; four-time World Rally champions Juha Kankkunen and Tommi M\u00e4kinen; and 13-time World Enduro Champion Juha Salminen, seven-time champion Kari Tiainen, and the five-time champions Mika Ahola, biathlete Kaisa M\u00e4k\u00e4r\u00e4inen and Samuli Aro. Finland is also one of the most successful nations in bandy, being the only nation beside Russia and Sweden to win a Bandy World Championship.<br \/>\nThe 1952 Summer Olympics were held in Helsinki. Other notable sporting events held in Finland include the 1983 and 2005 World Championships in Athletics.<br \/>\nFinland also has a notable history in figure skating. Finnish skaters have won 8 world championships and 13 junior world cups in synchronized skating, and Finland is considered one of the best countries at the sport.<br \/>\nSome of the most popular recreational sports and activities include floorball, Nordic walking, running, cycling, and skiing (alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, and ski jumping). Floorball, in terms of registered players, occupies third place after football and ice hockey.

As of 2016, the total number of licensed players reaches 57,400.<br \/>\nEspecially since the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup, Finland&#8217;s national basketball team has received widespread public attention. More than 8,000 Finns travelled to Spain to support their team. Overall, they chartered more than 40 airplanes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>International rankings<br \/>\n<\/strong>The 2019 World Happiest Report ranked Finland as the World&#8217;s happiest country for the second consecutive year.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>OBSERVATIONS AND TIPS 1.
