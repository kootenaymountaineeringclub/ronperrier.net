The ground floor housed the animals, while their merchant owners slept upstairs. The gate is locked and this site is not open but I could peer into the courtyard.<br \/>\n<strong>Harbour.<\/strong> The harbour\u2019s marina is still very much in service and if you are around early enough, you can watch the fishing boats come in and unload the day\u2019s catch.<br \/>\n<strong>Akko Light<\/strong> (Acre Light), is an active\u00a0lighthouse\u00a0on the SW corner of the city&#8217;s ancient walls, the former site of an\u00a0Ottoman\u00a0Flag Tower.<br \/>\nThe station was established in 1864 and the current structure in 1912.

This is where Baha\u2019ullah, a follower of the Bab and the founder of the faith, lived after his release from prison in Akko, and where he died in 1892. It\u2019s situated about a kilometre north of the town centre on the main Akko\u2013Nahariya road.

The\u00a0Jezreel Valley\u00a0lies to the immediate northeast.

The best way to get here is by taking the Carmelit subway to the top stop and then walking to the top of the gardens.<br \/>\nThe Haifa gardens also contain an International Teaching Center, the International Baha&#8217;i Archives (built in 1957, this Greek style building has classical Mediterranean architecture.<br \/>\n<span id=\"Bah.C3.A1.27.C3.AD_Faith\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>BAHA\u2019I.<\/strong> Founded in the middle of the 19th century, the Baha\u2019i faith (www.bahai.org) believes that many prophets have appeared throughout history, including Abraham, Moses, Buddha, Krishna, Zoroaster, Jesus and Mohammad. Its central beliefs include the existence of one God, the equality and unity of all human beings, and the unity of all religion. They believe in the equality of all people including men and women.<br \/>\nThe origins of the Baha\u2019i faith go back to Ali Muhammad (1819\u201350), a native of Shiraz, Iran. In 1844 he declared that he was \u2018the Bab\u2019 (Gate) through which prophecies would be revealed. The charismatic Ali was soon surrounded by followers, called Babis, but was eventually arrested for heresy against Islam and executed by firing squad in Tabriz.<br \/>\nOne of the Bab\u2019s prophecies concerned the coming of \u2018one whom God would make manifest\u2019. In 1866, a Babi named Mizra Hussein Ali proclaimed that he was this messianic figure and assumed the title of Baha\u2019ullah. His declarations were unwelcome in Persia and he was expelled first to Baghdad, then to Constantinople, Adrianople and finally the Ottoman penal colony of Akko. In his cell in Akko he dedicated himself to laying down the tenets of a new faith, the Baha\u2019i, whose name is derived from the Arabic word baha (glory).<br \/>\nThe Baha\u2019i faith now has an estimated five million followers worldwide. Two million Baha&#8217;i live in India, the largest community, but there is no community in Israel (other than the 100 volunteers at the gardens, it has been decided to not spread the religion to Israel to avoid conflict), site of the Baha\u2019i World Centre (the religion\u2019s global headquarters), whose gardens and institutions are staffed by volunteers from around the world. Tradition dictates that a Baha\u2019i who is able should make a pilgrimage to Akko and Haifa. All prayers are directed to Akko.<br \/>\nBaha&#8217;i believe that you are not born Baha&#8217;i but at age 15 choose to join the religion and individually approach the local community for membership. The church is run by and elected council of 9 religious leaders and a &#8216;Parliament&#8217; elected every 5 years.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Necropolis of Bet She&#8217;arim &#8211; A Landmark of Jewish Renewal.<\/strong>\u00a0 Consisting of a series of catacombs, the necropolis developed from the 2<sup>nd<\/sup>\u00a0century AD as the primary Jewish burial place outside Jerusalem following the failure of the second Jewish revolt against Roman rule.

But I wanted to see Baha\u2019i Gardens whose tour doesn\u2019t start till noon. I took city bus 112 to Elijah\u2019s Cave. It seems to have been converted into a synagogue. The walk up the steep stairs to Stella Maris had some lovely viewpoints with a 270\u00b0 view down to the Mediterranean. Successive rows of breakers with big surf would have made putting in with a kayak exciting. Stella Maris has a gorgeous dome, paintings and marble. Then it was about 4kms along the top of the hill to the start of the tour to Baha\u2019I Gardens.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CAESAREA.<\/strong> (pop 3400)<br \/>\nThis was one of the great cities of antiquity, rivalling great Mediterranean harbours such as Alexandria and Carthage. Despite efforts by various conquerors to keep the city alive, time and warfare eventually had their way and by the 14th century most of Caesarea had disappeared under the shifting dunes. Major excavations have been made over the past 60 years and Caesarea is now one of the country\u2019s most impressive archaeological sites.<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"http:\/\/beautifulcity2015.weebly.com\/caesarea-maritima.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwjSwNSr-tTfAhUJHzQIHdKUBKoQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"http:\/\/beautifulcity2015.weebly.com\/uploads\/6\/2\/1\/8\/62181573\/1866515_orig.jpg\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"587\" height=\"353\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<strong>History<\/strong>. Originally a Phoenician city, it really got it&#8217;s most significant start under Herod (37BC-4AD) who named it Caesarea in honour of Augustus Caesar and was populated by Romans, Samaritans and Jews. In 66AD, the Jews rebelled, Jerusalem was destroyed and Caesarea became the Roman capital of Judea in 70. During Byzantine times (4th-6th centuries), Caesarea was at its height of prosperity, a centre of Christian scholarship and its harbour the gateway for thousands of Holy Land pilgrims. The Muslims invaded in the 7th century, the Crusaders in 1101 and Saladdin in 1187 conquered it and destroyed its wall. The present fortifications were built in 1251 by the French king Louis IX. The Marmuliks conquered it in 1265 and the city was abandoned until the 19th century when the Ottomans settled Bosnian Muslim refugees here.<br \/>\nA visit to the Caesarea National Park starts off with a 10-minute movie dramatizing the history of the city. At the Crusader city, you can see the remains of the citadel and harbour. Beyond the walls to the north stretch the beachfront remains of an impressive Roman aqueduct. A hippodrome lies to the south, and beyond that, a reconstructed Roman amphitheatre, which serves as a modern-day concert venue. The site makes for a reasonable wander.<br \/>\nCaesarea is 55kms north of Tel Aviv and 40kms south of Haifa. Getting there is a pain on public transport. One method is to take any bus to Hadera then switch to bus 76. A modern, gated Caesarea of walled mansions has developed outside the archaeological area.<br \/>\nI caught bus #41 to the Central Bus Station and then the train from Haganna Station to Caesarea. Outside the train station, I met two young Swiss women working for 3 months as volunteers at a convent\/hotel on the Via Dolorosa inside the Old City of Jerusalem. They were on a day trip to see Caesarea. They felt precisely like me about Israeli Jews and Palestinians.<br \/>\nAt the train station we caught bus #80 to the Old City or ruins of Caesarea. It took 30 minutes to drive the 5kms &#8211; a circuitous route all over the town: part was through a very posh golf resort with very posh houses, most shuttered. We didn\u2019t pick or let off any passengers; I doubt that these people ever take public transport, but their maids, nannies and gardeners do. Also on the bus were three Jews from New York who live in Jerusalem. They were born here, migrated to the US for 35+ years and have returned to live in Israel. None of them liked Israelis either. \u201cThey have such bad manners\u201d.<br \/>\nI saw everything in the site taking about 75 minutes. Compared to some of the spectacular Roman sites I have seen this trip \u2013 Dougga, Bella Regia, and Jem in Tunisia, Belbak and Tyre in Lebanon and Jerash in Jordan, this is a poor cousin. It is not really worth the trip unless you have the time and desire to navigate the ponderous public transport to get here. I also had my National Park pass so saved the 38S admission fee.<\/p>\n<p><b>Sidna &#8216;Ali Mosque<\/b>\u00a0is a mosque located in the depopulated village of\u00a0Al-Haram\u00a0on the beach in the northern part of\u00a0<strong>Herzliya<\/strong>.\u00a0It serves as both a mosque and a\u00a0religious school.\u00a0<sup id=\"cite_ref-Israel_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>The existing building has no parts from before the 15th century.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Pet_3-4\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup><strong><span class=\"item spaced text-29457 \" style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.beautifulmosque.com\/Sidna-Ali-Mosque-in-Herzliya-Israel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwi_hrKOjdXfAhUG-lQKHQe_C4cQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/www.beautifulmosque.com\/PostImages\/sidna-ali-mosque-in-herzliya-israel-0.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Herzliya: Sidna Ali Mosque\" width=\"486\" height=\"353\" \/><\/a><\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><b>Herzliya<\/b>\u00a0is an affluent\u00a0city\u00a0in northern Tel Aviv District\u00a0known for its robust start-up and entrepreneurial culture.

During Solomon\u2019s time, the city came to prominence as a port and, according to the Bible, it was from here that Jonah set sail to his encounter with the whale. A group of rocks just offshore is said to be where Andromeda, one of Greek mythology\u2019s most beautiful princesses, was saved by Perseus.<br \/>\nFor thousands of years, while Tel Aviv was nothing more than a collection of sand dunes, Jaffa was one of the great cities of the Mediterranean. The small port doesn\u2019t get much seafaring traffic these days, but its hangars are being transformed into cafes, shops and art galleries.
