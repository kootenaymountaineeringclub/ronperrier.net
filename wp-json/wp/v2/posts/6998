A paradise of beautiful meadows and steep peaks rising above the jungles of the lowlands surrounding it, the Mulvey Group is the finest of the Valhallas and the West Kootenay. The shape is that of a horseshoe opening to the east, enclosing upper Mulvey Creek. It is a fine area for rock climbing, a centre unique in this part of the Selkirks. The summits are composed of gneiss (pronounced \u201cnice\u201d).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Grizzly and brown bears are common in Mulvey Creek and have been known to enter the meadows above.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Campfires are not permitted by the park authorities, and dogs are not allowed in the backcountry. Dogs infuriate bears and attract them.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Access<\/strong> <u><br \/>\n<\/u>The Mulvey Cirque was one of the last areas of the Selkirks to be explored and climbed because of difficulties in access. The best approach is from the south by the Bannock Burn Creek logging road (on the Little Slocan River; see the introduction to Southern Valhallas, and below). The condition of the road varies. It is best when logging is occurring and then all the water bars are removed. But the water bars are small and usually easily negotiated by a high-clearance 2-WD vehicle. One Labour Day weekend, we went to Mulvey; you could have driven a Ferrari up on Friday, but they reconstructed all the water bars just after we went up. Then backpack over the Gimli-Nisleheim col.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">To access the southern Valhallas, drive south from New Denver or north from Playmor Junction (between Nelson and Castlegar). <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> <u>From New Denver.<\/u> Start at the Petro Canada Station at the junction of Hwys 6 and 31A in New Denver.

At the end of the trail is the Gimli-Nisleheim (Jones) col or Gimli Ridge as it is now called. Descend from the col into the basin down a short rock ramp, deal with a very steep snow\/glacier and the trend northwest below the northeast face of Nisleheim, which is less steep. Once below the steep bit (about 20-30 vertical meters), go in whatever direction you wish to go. In the early season, or high snowfall years, the steep bit will be steep snow. If the snow is firm, an ice axe and crampons will be necessary for safety. When there is no snow and only ice late in the season, this can be death-defying without crampons and an axe.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Other Access Routes to Mulvey Basin\u00a0<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Midgard-Niselheim Col<\/strong>. Zigzag down ledges into Mulvey Basin, and the meadows, the gentlest slope down. Before the Gimli Ridge trail (1994), this was the main access into Mulvey Basin. The swithback is 300m lower than the Gimli Ridge TH.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">One route to access the Midgard-Nisleheim col involving bushwhacking goes up the true right bank of the stream issuing from the col. In the forest near the stream, blazes marking an old trail may be found; the bush is light to moderate. Above, go to the right and then pass over the Midgard- Nis1eheim col &#8211; 900 meters above. \u00a0\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Another way is to walk up the road heading NW from the big switchback below the Gimli Ridge TH. The slopes are not quite as steep and gain a steep ridge in the forest with a cliff below (less bush) which leads toward the Prestley-Midgard ridge. One may then reach the col or the ridge of Midgard first, going to the right, east, or continue left to Mt. Prestley.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Access to Wolfs Ears, Robertson Creek and Dag<\/strong>. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The valley to the right (south of Gimli) is the broad cirque between Gimli and West Wolf\u2019s Ear on their south sides. A ridge leads south from West Wolf\u2019s Ear.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Road Access. Instead of turning into the present Gimli Ridge parking area, continue SE on the old road for another 100 metres and turn left or north into the old cut block above and east\u00a0of the lower parking lot. The road is very deteriorated and probably now impassable at a small creek washout. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Park where possible and walk north to the end of the old road. A flagged route led north into the meadows SE of Gimli. Ascend the ridge coming off the south end of the Wolfs Ears. One access to Mulvey Basin is from the\u00a0Wolfs Ears\/Nott col (small rock cliffs make for some difficulties). <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">To reach the headwaters of Robertson Creek to access Little Dag and Dag, diagonal up through boulder fields to reach the above ridge at a point west of (551-116) on the other side. It is then easy to drop down on the east side and into the Robertson Creek drainage to Mt. Dag.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Brian Berry and party in 1972 developed a mountaineer\u2019s high-level route from Drinnon Lake (see introduction to S. Valhallas) to the Mulvey Basin. The 1972 party proceeded from E to W and descended Woden Creek to Lower Arrow Lake. It is a full one-day pack.<br \/>\nBecause of hiker&#8217;s errors in navigation, al the cairns marking this route were removed by Parks.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">From Drinnon Lake, ascend to the pass in the north ridge of Drinnon Peak, contour and descend toward Valhalla Lake. Go over the pass west of Mount Prestley\u2019s three summits and contour south of Mt. Prestley at the treeline to the basin between Midgard and Prestley. Cross the pass southeast of Midgard to the Mulvey Meadows. There is difficulty with the south ridge of the W summit of Prestley, which is Class 3 with packs. (V)<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">A probably better variation is to pass north around Valhalla Lake to Prestley Lakes (east of Valhalla Lake) and go over the Prestley-Midgard <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">col to join the above route. A longer way is to go around the north ridge of Asgard Peak and go over the pass just east of Asgard to Mulvey Meadows. Both of these variations may be used to reach Gwillim Creek. Descend (or ascend) to Tracy Cooper Lake (north of Asgard) in Gwillim Creek and descend by trail (overgrown?) on its true left bank for about 8 km to the Gwillim Cabin. (V, 1986). Then gain the lake shore trail which goes from Slocan City to Evans Creek, joining it at Slocan City.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The East Hump-Wedge col was crossed in a traverse from Gwillim Creek to Mulvey Creek in June 1965, using many rappels, by Bill Boulton, Chris Kopczynski and W.
