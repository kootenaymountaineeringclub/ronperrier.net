The trail used almost exclusively now is the old mining road at the northeast end of the parking lot that provides a more gradual but less attractive starting route. The original trail starts on the east edge of the parking lot and is not marked. It was originally built before 1900 for mining activities and climbs quite steeply for the first 1.6 km through a lush subalpine forest. It meets the mining road after about .8km of switchbacks. Water is available at several streams that cross the trail. After 15 minutes, turn left onto a sign-posted trail.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">On the slopes above, the remains of the Molly Gibson Mine site can be seen, and gradually an ever-increasing panorama of ragged peaks unfolds.

The trail follows along its western shore, crossing a large talus slope and a more recent rock fall that required rerouting the trail through it. Hoary marmots are common here and sometimes quite tame. Do not feed!<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Past the lake, the trail crosses a lush alpine meadow and climbs steadily to Kokanee Pass, then into a vast subalpine basin with many lakes and open rolling terrain.

He was taking a back-country skiing trip with some friends in Kokanee Glacier PP when he was swept into Kokanee Lake and unable to reach the shore. His companions were unable to effect a rescue, and Trudeau drowned. An extensive search was launched, but his body has never been found. The lake&#8217;s high altitude and limited days of open waters each year prevented divers from completing the search.
