It sits at an elevation of 2,325 metres (7,628 ft), making it the sixth-highest capital in the world by altitude and the second-highest capital in Africa. The city is located at the tip of an escarpment that is both the northwestern edge of the Eritrean Highlands and the Great Rift Valley in neighbouring Ethiopia. In 2017, the city was declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its well-preserved modernist architecture.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The site of Asmera was first settled in 800 BC. The city was then founded in the 12th century AD after four separate villages were unified to live together peacefully after long periods of conflict. Under Italian rule, the city of Asmara was made the capital of Eritrea.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Italian Asmara<\/strong>.\u00a0Asmara, a small village in the nineteenth century, started to grow quickly when it was occupied by Italy in 1889 and\u00a0made the capital city of Italian Eritrea in 1897.\u00a0In the early 20th century, the\u00a0Eritrean Railway\u00a0was built to the coast, passing through the town of\u00a0Ghinda,<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A large Italian community developed the city. In 1939, Asmara had a population of 98,000, of whom 53,000 were Italian of the 75,000 Italians in all of Eritrea, The capital acquired an Italian architectural look. Europeans used Asmara \u201cto experiment with radical new designs\u201d \u2013 handsome wide streets, ornate public buildings, and a modern sewage system. Nowadays, more than 400 buildings are of Italian origin, and many shops still have Italian names. The Kingdom of Italy invested in the industrial development of Asmara (and surrounding areas of Eritrea), but the beginning of World War II brought this to a halt.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">UNESCO\u00a0made Asmara a World Heritage Site in July 2017, saying \u201cIt is an exceptional example of early modernist urbanism at the beginning of the 20th century and its application in an African context\u201d.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Federation with Ethiopia.\u00a0<\/strong>In 1952, the United Nations resolved to federate the former colony under Ethiopian rule. During the Federation, Asmara was no longer the capital city. The capital was now\u00a0Addis Ababa, over 1,000 km to the south. The national language of the city was therefore replaced from the Tigrinya language\u00a0to the Ethiopian\u00a0Amharic language. In 1961, Emperor\u00a0Haile Selassie I\u00a0ended the \u201cfederal\u201d arrangement and declared the territory to be the 14th province of the\u00a0Ethiopian Empire.\u00a0Ethiopia\u2019s biggest ally was the United States. The city was home to the\u00a0US Army\u2019s\u00a0Kagnew Station\u00a0installation from 1943 until 1977. The\u00a0Eritrean War of Independence\u00a0began in 1961 and ended in 1991, resulting in the independence of Eritrea. Asmara was left relatively undamaged throughout the war, as were the majority of highland regions. After independence, Asmara again became the capital of Eritrea.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The lands that surround Asmara are very fertile, especially those to the south of the Debub Region of Eritrea. The highlands that Asmera is in fall away to reveal the eastern lowlands, characterized by the searing heat and humidity of the Eritrean salt pans and lapped by the Red Sea. To the west of the plateau stretches a vast semi-arid hilly terrain continuing all the way towards the border with Sudan through the Gash-Barka Region.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Climate.<\/strong> Asmara has a semi-arid climate. It is dry for 185 days a year with an average humidity of 51% and a UV index of 6.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Architecture.<\/strong> The city is known for its early 20th-century buildings, including the Art Deco Cinema Impero (opened in 1937 and considered by the experts one of the world\u2019s finest examples of Art D\u00e9co style building, Cubist Africa Pension, eclectic Eritrean Orthodox Enda Mariam Cathedral and former Opera House, the futurist Fiat Tagliero Building, the neo-Romanesque Church of Our Lady of the Rosary, Asmara, and the neoclassical Governor\u2019s Palace. The city is adorned by Italian colonial villas and mansions, one prominent example being the World Bank Building. Most of central Asmara was built between 1935 and 1941, so the Italians effectively managed to build almost an entire city in just six years. At this time, the dictator Benito Mussolini had great plans for a second Roman Empire in Africa. War cut this short, but his injection of funds created the Asmara of today, which supposedly was to be a symbol of colonial fascism during that period.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The city shows off most early 20th-century architectural styles. Some buildings are neo-Romanesque, such as the Church of Our Lady of the Rosary, and some villas are built in a late Victorian style. Art Deco influences are found throughout the city. Essences of Cubism can be found on the Africa Pension Building, and on a small collection of buildings. The Fiat Tagliero Building shows almost the height of futurism, just as it was coming into big fashion in Italy.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Asmara is known to be an exceptionally modern city, not only because of its architecture, but it had more\u00a0traffic lights\u00a0than\u00a0Rome did when the city was being built. The city incorporates many features of a planned city.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Asmara has wide streets, restaurants, piazzas (town squares), bars and cafes while many boulevards are lined with palm trees. The Italian-inspired food and culture is very present and was introduced during Italian Eritrea. Countless restaurants and cafes serve high-quality espresso, cappuccinos and lattes, gelato parlours and restaurants with Italian Eritrean cuisine. Common dishes served in the Italian Eritrean cuisine are \u2018Pasta al Sugo e Berbere\u2019, which means \u201cpasta with tomato sauce and berbere\u201d (spice), \u201clasagna\u201d and \u201ccotoletta alla milanese\u201d (Milano cutlet).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Airports Asmara (ASM)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Asmara A Modernist African City<\/strong>\u00a0WHS.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Day 1<\/strong> Mon Jan 16<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>Flight.<\/em> Hergaisa-ADD-Asmara (Ethiopian Airlines) @12:00-17:10.

It is fronted by a huge piece of dirt with two metal lighthouses and a stone wall.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Dahlak Hotel at the end of the causeway in Central Massawa looked like a 5-star place, but there was no one visible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>MASSAWA OLD TOWN <\/strong>(pop 30,000 and much less now)<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong>Used by the Greeks and Egyptians, it became a major trade outlet for the Turks in the 16<sup>th<\/sup> and 17<sup>th<\/sup> centuries (slaves, pearls, hides and fish) and drew traders from India and the Middle East. Its ancient title was the \u201cPearl of the Red Sea\u201d as its port was one of the safest harbours in East Africa. The Sahabas (an Islamic sect) arrived here in the 6<sup>th<\/sup> century from near Jeddah. The Shafi Mosque was built in the 7<sup>th<\/sup> century and is one of the oldest mosques in Africa.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The narrow-gauge railway between Asmara and Massawa was destroyed in the war in 1975 but was rebuilt using steam engines but it now not functioning.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Massawa expanded significantly during the Italian era and Massawa Island was joined to the Twalet Island by a causeway.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It has many bars, restaurants and art deco buildings with carved wood doors, shutters and balconies. That may have been in the past, but today, it is virtually deserted and I saw almost none of that. It reminded me of \u201cThe World Without Us\u201d \u2013 what wasn\u2019t a ruin was rapidly becoming one. Many buildings are built using coral blocks and these were in the worst state. I entered the Sheikh Derbush Tomb, a neglected space but with a tomb. Another mosque looked very nice with good coral walls, a hexagonal minaret and green doors and shutters, but was closed and looked never used.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I didn\u2019t see one car. The only people were a few groups of kids kicking around a soccer ball, some old people sitting looking out at space and two guys lounging on a cot. A woman was filling jugs of water from a tap at the bottom of meter square hole in the ground. There were 3 small shops open and the four bars were closed. I didn\u2019t see any hotels or restaurants. It appeared that the port had taken over the entire east end of the island, consuming anything old there including two advertised mosques.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I talked to someone in Asmara about Massawa \u2013 now is not the time to come, everyone goes there in June to August for the beaches. I am not a beach person.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The drive here is much more rewarding than the destination. Oh well, there was not much more to see in Asmara (and I had one more night and more than 30 hours to see that) and I got one more NM region and a few sites.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Massawa Central Mosque.<\/strong> There is no central mosque but four were marked on the map. The only one open was the Sheikh Hanal Alansaui Mosque dating from the 16<sup>th<\/sup> century. It is lovely with a round minaret, many round columns with turquoise tiles on the bottoms and a large white dome. The mihrab was blue\/white tile with a narrow wood minbar. There was no one inside.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I had dinner at the Luna Hotel, possibly the only place to eat in all of Massawa.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">ON Luna Hotel 500 EN. This was not nearly as nice as African Pension but it appeared all that was available in Central Massawa. They have a restaurant.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><br \/>\nDay 4<\/strong> Thur Jan 19<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>I left the hotel at 4:45am and walked the 2.6 km to the bus depot to get the early bus from Massawa back to Asmara 31 EN. It left at 6:30 am with a full load. Arrive before 5:30 to get a front seat for the best view.<br \/>\nCompared to the daytime in Massawa, the place was almost chaotic. The Eastern Orthodox Cathedral was standing room only with people scattered all over outside. The sermon could be heard for blocks. On the walk over the causeway, I passed many more people than when I arrived.<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>When back in Asmara, I had a walkabout to see the following, all in north Aamara.<br \/>\n<\/em><strong>Medebar Market.<\/strong> There are 100s of privately owned stalls, most metal workshops (welders, and grinders working full time), and some woodworking shops where everything possible is recycled into rustic objects. Blacksmiths make axe heads, ploughs and other farm tools. Another large section is devoted to grinding hot peppers to which are added other spices, most by hand with mortar and pestles. They can make anything here \u2013 it is a hovel of galvanized sheds, all looking very junky.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Enda Mariam Cathedral<\/strong> (St Mary\u2019s Orthodox Church). Built in 1938, it is 1 km north of the centre sitting on a hill. Built of alternating thin layers of red brick and grey\/black stone, it has two huge square bell towers. Inside, it is triple nave with Byzantine paintings of Bible stories, angels and religious icons. Piece carpets cover the floor. Remove your shoes to enter, women to the right and men to the left.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Just as I finished seeing the church, a huge procession led by several priests and serenaded in by guys blowing long gold horns approached the church from below. This was Timkat, the big religious occasion of the year. To a slow drumbeat, there were slow songs, intermittent horn blowing and a fluttering chant from the crowd. All the participants (almost all women) wore white shawls and several knelt on the ground praying. I just happened to be here at the right time.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">After a few prayers and bowing, the priests entered the church. Pieces of bread were distributed, and the people sat on the steps and low walls bordering the church and then left. So much for that.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Great Mosque of Asmara.<\/strong> Built in 1938 and covered inside and out with small tiles \u2013 light orange and green.

Women are not allowed to enter.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I was initially not allowed to enter, but said I just wanted to have a quick look and they let even with shorts on. Then a guy approached me and said I needed a permit from the Ministry of Tourism.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>I then wandered through downtown but no one had liquid milk. I had lunch at Daniel\u2019s Fast Food. The hamburger was the thinnest possible, the chips cold and the Coke never arrived. The service was awful, but the place was packed with old guys having tea and no food. I paid only for the hamburger. I had dinner again at the Spaghetti and Pizza House, the only place with reasonable food. The carbonara pasta had no pancetta, but some bologna-like meat.<br \/>\nI was in bed reading by 20:30.

An old guy at the front door of the coffee shop sat with a bottle of hand sanitizer, something the world stopped long ago.<br \/>\nI passed the same elementary school for the third time. All the little kids wear a lime green shirt with a red bowtie. They all shout \u201cChina\u201d at me.<br \/>\nAt the hotel, I talked to the desk clerk, the same guy here every day. He sleeps on a mattress under the desk. He is happy with the autocratic leader \u2013 there is no war, he has a job, and he can walk around 24 hours a day and not have police bother him. Besides the hotel, he works as a woodworker making furniture and gets great satisfaction from the things he makes. He sees no great problem with not having internet \u2013 the world goes on without knowing anything about it.<br \/>\nI checked out at 11:30, left my luggage and walked down to Teketse\u2019s office to give him $100 for all the help he gave me. He took me to a market specializing in baskets and then returned to Medabar Market.<br \/>\nHe bought me a wooden coffee pot as a gift and then took me to one of his neighbours for lunch. We had very good single, coffee (freshly roasted over a fire and ground with ginger), homemade beer, salad, orange, banana, and cake \u2013 it kept coming.<br \/>\nWe then returned to Africa Pension to get my luggage, visited Sembel (hard to find) and then dropped me off at the airport at 4 to get my flight to Addis. He is a wonderful guy.
