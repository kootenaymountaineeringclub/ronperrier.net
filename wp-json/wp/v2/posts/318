K\u00fcpper, V. Schoeffl, J. Milledge<br \/>\n2008<br \/>\nUIAA MedCom Consensus Statement No.5: Traveller\u2019s Diarrhoea in the Mountains<br \/>\nPage: 2 \/ 7<br \/>\nIntroduction<br \/>\nTraveller\u2019s diarrhoea is one of the most important medical problems for trekkers and<br \/>\nexpedition mountaineering. Although the detail of the data are still in discussion there<br \/>\nis no question that the loss of body water and electrolytes impairs the physical and<br \/>\nmental capacity significantly and dehydration increases the risk of Acute Mountain<br \/>\nSickness (AMS), thrombosis \/ thromboembolism, frostbite and other altitude- or cold<br \/>\nrelated health risks. Therefore it is a \u201cmust\u201d for any mountaineer to avoid traveller\u2019s<br \/>\ndiarrhoea as much as possible and to treat symptoms consequently. In contrast to<br \/>\nthe \u201cnormal\u201d travellers diarrhoea experienced at sea level, the consequences of<br \/>\nsignificant diarrhoea can cause an additional increased risk in a high altitude<br \/>\nenvironment, therefore treatment should be started earlier and more \u201caggressively\u201d<br \/>\nthan would be the case for \u201cnormal\u201d traveller\u2019s visiting resorts or national parks at low<br \/>\naltitude.<br \/>\nFor water hygiene \/ disinfection see UIAA MedCom Consensus Paper No. 6!<br \/>\nGerms to induce traveller\u2019s diarrhoea<br \/>\nThere are many species which can induce diarrhoea and these species fall into at<br \/>\nleast four different categories: viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and helminths. Therefore<br \/>\nthere is no \u201cone-and-only prophylaxis\u201d for traveller\u2019s diarrhoea. While there are<br \/>\nvaccinations against some of them (e.g. hepatitis A, polio, salmonella typhi), for most<br \/>\nof them different techniques of personal and group hygiene present the only chance<br \/>\nto minimize the risk. But even in the best setting >75% of the visitors make significant<br \/>\nmistakes in (food) hygiene.<br \/>\nRisk determining factors<br \/>\nSeveral factors are important for the individual risk: age <30y., the region visited (e.g.\ntraveller\u2019s diarrhoea in the Alps ca. 4%, in Nepal up to 80%), rainy season, duration\nof sojourn, type of travelling (\u201cadventure travel\u201d, mountaineering), reduced gastric\nacid (H2-Blockers, acid absorbing drugs etc.), reduced immunocompetence, diabetes\nor previous stay in a developing country for >6 months. But it should be mentioned<br \/>\nhere that the individual risk for traveller\u2019s diarrhoea is highly variable. Some<br \/>\nobservations indicate, that a permanent stay in a developing country for >6 months<br \/>\ndecreases the chance of getting diarrhoea, possibly because the bowel gets<br \/>\n\u201cconditioned\u201d.<br \/>\nPersons who have one or more of these risk factors should get individual advice by a<br \/>\nphysician experienced in travel medicine.<br \/>\nSpecial attention and education should be given to any person \u2013 traveller or local<br \/>\nstaff \u2013 who handles food. Hygiene of hands (washing before food handling!), cleaning<br \/>\nsurfaces or equipment (dishes, spoons, knives\u2026) which get in contact with food is<br \/>\nessential. It is a good idea to separate any meat products away from vegetables,<br \/>\nfruits, or eggs \u2013 Keep separate any food\/s which may be contaminated with<br \/>\npathologic microorganisms.<br \/>\nUIAA MedCom Consensus Statement No.5: Traveller\u2019s Diarrhoea in the Mountains<br \/>\nPage: 3 \/ 7<br \/>\nRisk checklist for travellers<br \/>\n1.

Maintain strict hygiene with respect to water management and managing any<br \/>\nhuman waste (see also UIAA MedCom Recommendation No. 6)<br \/>\n! Maintain strict personal hygiene<br \/>\no Especially washing hands before handling any kind of food, water or<br \/>\nbeverage<br \/>\n! Drink only beverages from safe water sources (cooked or treated for<br \/>\ndisinfection) or safe industrial beverages<br \/>\no &#8211; dental hygiene is also important!<br \/>\n! No non-cooked milk or milk products<br \/>\n! Meat must be well done<br \/>\n! No salad<br \/>\n! Peeled fruits only<br \/>\no Peeled by yourself, otherwise the problem may not be solved<br \/>\no Be careful: Some fruits are dangerous, even if they are peeled! Melons,<br \/>\nfor example, are sold by weight. If you inject water at the stipe or at the<br \/>\ndried rest of the flower, the fruit will be heavier and therefore more<br \/>\nexpensive, but if the injected water was unsafe, the water and sugar<br \/>\ncontaining fruit is an optimal incubator for bacteria, especially if the fruit<br \/>\nis stored in the sun!<br \/>\n! No cold sauces or products made from fresh eggs without cooking<br \/>\n! Clean dishes, cutlery, pans and pots always with safe water<br \/>\no At least the final cleaning. If safe water is a problem, unsafe water can<br \/>\nbe used for basic cleaning.<br \/>\no The member who is ill with diarrhoea may not be able to climb. Do not<br \/>\nask him\/her to prepare food or work in the kitchen so that food is ready<br \/>\non return for those who continue to climb!<br \/>\nNote! The slogan \u201cpeel it, boil it, cook it, or forget it\u201d does not guarantee safe<br \/>\nfood! Because some germs produce toxins, the quality of the food which will be<br \/>\ncooked is very important, independent from the kind of processing. Or, as an African<br \/>\nphysician tells the villagers: \u201cIf you cook shit, you\u2019ll eat cooked shit!\u201d (citation from a<br \/>\ncourse for public health). Ensure the quality of any food eaten (processed or not)<br \/>\nis of a good quality. Or remember a five star hotel can have a zero start kitchen if<br \/>\nthere are no hand washing facilities for the staff. Ensure that any person who is<br \/>\ninvolved in the handling or preparation of food regularly washes his\/her hands<br \/>\nbefore touching food or kitchen equipment and before eating! There will be<br \/>\nmany situations where safe water is sparse. Here hygienic towels with disinfectant<br \/>\nmay be used for hands, cutlers, and dishes (after a rough cleaning with unsafe<br \/>\nwater).<br \/>\nUIAA MedCom Consensus Statement No.5: Traveller\u2019s Diarrhoea in the Mountains<br \/>\nPage: 5 \/ 7<br \/>\nSymptoms of traveller\u2019s diarrhoea<br \/>\n!
