However, in the last 40 years the country has been in chaos due to major wars\u2014from the Soviet invasion of 1979 to their withdrawal in 1989 and from warlordism to the removal of the Taliban in 2001 and the ensuing US\/NATO invasion. Economically, Afghanistan is considered poor compared to many other nations of the world. The country is going through a nationwide rebuilding process.<\/p>\n<p>English spellings of Afghan place names vary. For example, Q may replace K as in Qandahar or Qunduz. Kunduz will be seen spelled as Konduz, Qunduz, Qundoz, Qundoze and variations on these. Bamiyan is often spelled as Bamian or Bamyan.

While visiting has not been advisable for several years, it has much to offer the intrepid traveller. But even the more adventurous should consider looking elsewhere for thrill-seeking.<br \/>\n<strong>Climate. <\/strong>Temperatures in the central highlands are below freezing for most of the winter, and snow is common at higher elevations. Summertime highs in lower elevations (such as\u00a0Jalalabad\u00a0or\u00a0Mazar-e Sharif) can exceed 50\u00b0C\/120\u00b0F. In higher areas such as Kabul, summer temperatures can be 30\u00b0C\/90\u00b0F and winter around 0\u00b0C\/30\u00b0F. The most pleasant weather in Kabul is during April, May and September.<br \/>\n<strong>Terrain. <\/strong>Mostly rugged mountains; plains in north and southwest. The Hindu Kush mountains run northeast to southwest, dividing the northern provinces from the rest of the country, with the highest peaks found in the northern\u00a0Wakhan Corridor. South of Kandahar is desert.<br \/>\nThe lowest point is Amu Darya at 258 m, and the highest is Nowshak at 7,485 m.<br \/>\nAfghanistan is bordered by\u00a0Pakistan\u00a0to the south and east,\u00a0Iran\u00a0to the west,\u00a0Turkmenistan,\u00a0Uzbekistan\u00a0and\u00a0Tajikistan\u00a0to the north. There is a short border with\u00a0China\u00a0to the far northeast, but in extremely inaccessible terrain.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nPEOPLE. <\/strong>Afghanistan is an ethnically diverse country. Tribal and local allegiances are strong, which complicates national politics immensely. The largest ethnic group is the Pashtun, followed by Tajik, Hazara, Uzbek and others.<br \/>\n<strong>Baloch tribesmen<\/strong>, still largely nomadic, can be found anywhere between\u00a0Quetta\u00a0in Pakistan and\u00a0Mashad\u00a0in Iran, including much of western Afghanistan. They make marvellous\u00a0rugs, if somewhat simple.<br \/>\n<strong>Hazaras<\/strong> in the central mountains look much more Asiatic than other Afghans. According to some theories, they are descended from Genghis Khan&#8217;s soldiers.<br \/>\nThe two largest linguistic groups speak Pashto and Dari (Afghan Persian). Pashto speakers predominate in the south and east, Dari in the north, west and central Afghanistan. About 11% of the population have Turkic languages, Uzbek. or Turkmen, as their first language. Many of them are in the north, near\u00a0Uzbekistan\u00a0and\u00a0Turkmenistan. Minor native language groups include Nuristanis, Pashais and Pamiris, found in small pockets in the east and northeast.<br \/>\nThere are also thousands of Hindus and Sikhs living in different cities but mostly in\u00a0Kabul,\u00a0Jalalabad, and\u00a0Kandahar.<br \/>\n<strong>The Afghan Girl.<\/strong> The\u00a0June 1985 cover of\u00a0National Geographic\u00a0showed the most haunting image of the Afghan War: a young Afghan girl, with piercing sea-green eyes and a dilapidated hijab. The photo, taken by Steve McCurry in Pakistan in 1984, became the icon of the troubles in Afghanistan. But, for 17 years, no one knew the girl&#8217;s name. Then in 2002, following the defeat of the Taliban, National Geographic finally located the girl and her identity: Sharbat Gula. She vividly recalled being photographed and recognized her face as the one in the photo. Today, in her honour, NG now runs a fund to educate young Afghan girls, who were denied education under the Taliban.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HISTORY<br \/>\n<\/strong>Being the\u00a0Silk Road&#8217;s gateway between the\u00a0Middle East\u00a0and\u00a0East Asia, Afghanistan has been so difficult to conquer for history&#8217;s great armies, that it is known as the\u00a0Graveyard of Empires. The country has a long history of warfare, mostly against invaders such as Darius I,\u00a0Alexander of Macedon,\u00a0Persians, Arabs,\u00a0Turks,\u00a0Mongols, and the\u00a0British. Its recent history is no exception. The modern-day country was founded when Mirwais Hotak rose up against the Persians in 1709 and established the Hotak dynasty, with its capital at\u00a0Kandahar. It later included what is now Iran and Iraq but the Hotaki dynasty collapsed in 1738. In 1747, Ahmad Shah Durrani re-established Afghanistan and expanded it to include much of Pakistan as well as northeastern Iran and the Western parts India.<br \/>\nIn 1919, Afghanistan established independence as an emirate until a kingdom was proclaimed by Amanullah Khan. As king, he attempted to modernise the country through Western designs. In 1933, Mohammed Zahir Shah succeeded to the throne and ruled the country until 1973, when the constitutional monarchy was overthrown in a coup, and the country became a republic.<br \/>\nAfter the April 1978 revolution and successful coup by pro-Communist forces, the Soviet Union invaded in December 1979 to support the new socialist regime. War ensued. By February 1989 all Soviet forces withdrew from the country but fighting continued between Soviet-backed Afghan government forces and mujahideen rebels, who were funded by the United States, Saudi Arabia and others while trained by Pakistan and Iran.<br \/>\nThe Taliban grew out of this chaos in late 1994, providing a solution to what was by this time a civil war. Backed by foreign sponsors, and inspired by a conservative sect of Islam, the Taliban developed as a political force to end the civil war and bring security to the country. They seized the capital of Kabul in late 1996 and controlled most of the country by 2000, aside from some areas in the northeast.<br \/>\nAfter the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the US, the Taliban refused to hand over Osama bin Laden or other al-Qaeda militants to the United States, though they did offer to try Osama in their own shariah court if the US government shared &#8220;solid evidence&#8221; of his alleged guilt with them, and also expressed willingness in principle to consider extraditing Osama to a neutral country for a trial before a shariah court there if such an action would stave off US-led invasion. The US refused to share whatever evidence they had with the Taliban and considered the Taliban&#8217;s offers insufficient, so they and their allies chose to take military action with support from anti-Taliban Afghans \u2014 mainly Kazakhs and Kirghiz from the north of the country who fought in the Northern Alliance \u2014 causing the Taliban&#8217;s regime to fall in December 2001.<br \/>\nThe same month, representatives from all ethnic groups of Afghanistan met in\u00a0Germany\u00a0and agreed to form a new government with Hamid Karzai as Chairman of the Afghan Interim Authority. Following a nationwide election in 2004, Hamid Karzai was elected as President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. A year later, in 2005, legislative elections were held and the country&#8217;s parliament began functioning again. In addition to occasionally violent political jockeying and ongoing military action to root out anti-government elements, the country suffers from widespread election fraud, poverty, corruption, and opium cultivation.<br \/>\nIn 2005, Afghanistan and the US signed a strategic partnership agreement committing both nations to a long-term relationship. In 2012, Afghanistan and the US signed another more important strategic partnership agreement. It also signed strategic partnership agreements with India, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and many other nations. In the mean time, around US$50 billion is being spent on the reconstruction of the country.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Electricity.<\/strong> There are three types of electrical outlets, the old British standard, the newer British standard and the European standard.<br \/>\n<strong>Read.<br \/>\n<\/strong><em>Afghan Scene Magazine<\/em><br \/>\n<em>A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush<\/em>\u00a0by Eric Newby \u2013 a hilarious account of pioneer trekking in\u00a0Nuristan\u00a0in the 1950s<br \/>\n<em>The Places in Between<\/em>\u00a0by Rory Stewart \u2013 a fascinating post 9\/11 travelogue of Stewart&#8217;s walk from Herat to Kabul just after the fall of the Taliban.<br \/>\n<em>The Kite Runner<\/em>\u00a0by Khalid Hosseini \u2013 a beautiful and heartbreaking tale of childhood in Afghanistan<br \/>\n<em>Good Morning Afghanistan<\/em>\u00a0by Waseem Mahmood &#8211; a true account of the setting up of the first public radio station in Kabul after the Taliban fell.<br \/>\n<em>An Unexpected Light: Travels in Afghanistan<\/em>\u00a0by Jason Elliot\u2014a travelogue from the period between the expulsion of the Soviets and the ascension of the Taliban.

The latest CIA country profile mentions that Dari is spoken by about 50%, mainly in the Kabul, Herat, Mazar-e Sharif and Central Afghanistan regions. Pashto is spoken by 35%, mainly in the south and east; it is also spoken in neighbouring Pakistan. The remaining are Turkic native language, primarily\u00a0Uzbek\u00a0and\u00a0Turkmen, and there are also 30 minor languages such as Balochi. You&#8217;ll find a few people in Kabul who speak a little English, but otherwise it isn&#8217;t widely understood.<br \/>\nThe English language is at its apex in Afghanistan. The percentage of those who now speak some English has reached unprecedented rates. President and his cabinet are fluent in English. English was taught in the past from the 7th grade, but now is taught from the fourth grade. Signs in English in the streets are becoming common now all over the country. English is the second foreign language in Afghanistan. Thanks to the influence of Bollywood and cordial relations of Afghanistan and\u00a0India, many Afghans,especially in\u00a0Kabul\u00a0are interested in learning\u00a0Hindi,which is also widely understood.The number of Hindi speakers in Afghanistan has risen dramatically.So if any Indian wants to visit Afghanistan can try their luck speaking Hindi.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GET IN<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Visas.<\/strong> Most visitors need to apply for a visa in advance, and they are often easier to obtain than you might expect. See the Afghanistan Foreign Ministry&#8217;s\u00a0visa webpage.<br \/>\n<strong>By plane. <\/strong>Kabul International Airport\u00a0(KBL) in\u00a0Kabul\u00a0is the main entry point to the country. In late 2008, the barely functioning old terminal was refurbished and is now for domestic flights, while the brand new Japanese-constructed terminal is for international flights.<br \/>\nThe national carrier,\u00a0Ariana Afghan Airlines, is flying with a small fleet of about 14 Airbuses and Boeings. They have daily flights from\u00a0Dubai, and periodic flights from\u00a0Frankfurt,\u00a0Islamabad,\u00a0Delhi,\u00a0Istanbul,\u00a0Baku\u00a0and\u00a0Tehran. Ariana is particularly bad at keeping to schedules \u2014 flights can be cancelled or delayed without notice.<br \/>\nA better option is the independent operator\u00a0Kam Air, which has twice daily flights from Dubai, twice weekly flights from\u00a0Delhi\u00a0and weekly flights from\u00a0Almaty,\u00a0Istanbul\u00a0and\u00a0Mashad. Some of the flights on the Dubai to Kabul route stop in\u00a0Herat\u00a0if you&#8217;d prefer to enter the country there.\u00a0Safi Air\u00a0also provides flights between Dubai and Kabul. They are the only safety-accredited airline in Afghanistan. Safi is the only Afghan airline allowed to fly into Europe and has direct flights to Frankfurt. The service is good and planes are sound. Staff are professional.<br \/>\nPakistan International Airlines (PIA)\u00a0flies four times per week from Islamabad and once per week from Peshawar to Kabul. Another route in may be via through\u00a0Tehran\u00a0or\u00a0Mashad\u00a0in\u00a0Iran.\u00a0Iran Air\u00a0has periodic flights from\u00a0Tehran\u00a0to Kabul.\u00a0Air India\u00a0operates six flights a week from Delhi to Kabul.\u00a0Turkish Airlines\u00a0also began flights between Kabul and Istanbul in 2011.\u00a0Air Arabia\u00a0used to fly four times per week from\u00a0Sharjah\u00a0\u2014 however, they have suspended operations.<br \/>\nFlights to other cities such as\u00a0Mazar-e Sharif\u00a0may be available if you can hook up with the charter company\u00a0PACTEC; however, seating is very limited.<br \/>\n<strong>By car<\/strong>. The famous\u00a0Khyber Pass\u00a0is not advised as a route in or out of the country. From 2007, it was closed for many years to third-country nationals, however, since 2017 there have been reports that the border is open and travellers have been able to cross. This is easier in the Afghanistan -&gt; Pakistan direction, and in either direction requires significant planning. A greater concern is the threat from Taliban near the pass, who have been known to kill\/kidnap Westerners and other foreigners. You are\u00a0strongly\u00a0discouraged from passing through the Khyber Pass.<br \/>\nThere are a number of roads into Afghanistan:<br \/>\nFrom\u00a0Peshawar,\u00a0Pakistan, via the\u00a0Khyber Pass\u00a0to\u00a0Jalalabad, in the east. See above for details.<br \/>\nFrom\u00a0Quetta, Pakistan, to\u00a0Kandahar, in the south. This crossing is\u00a0closed\u00a0to third-country nationals.<br \/>\nFrom\u00a0Mashad,\u00a0Iran\u00a0to\u00a0Herat, in the west. This border is open to foreigners.<br \/>\nFrom\u00a0Termez,\u00a0Uzbekistan\u00a0to\u00a0Mazar-e Sharif, in the north. This border is open to third-country nationals.<br \/>\nFrom\u00a0Tajikistan\u00a0to\u00a0Kunduz, in the northwest. The security situation at this border is not considered conducive to passage as of 2019.<br \/>\nAs of 2020,\u00a0none of these routes should be considered especially safe.<br \/>\n<strong>By bus. <\/strong>Buses run regularly between\u00a0Jalalabad\u00a0and\u00a0Peshawar,\u00a0Pakistan. Also, between\u00a0Herat\u00a0and\u00a0Mashad,\u00a0Iran. Afghani buses are thoroughly checked by Iranian border police for possible drugs, so expect delays.<br \/>\n<strong>By train. <\/strong>Afghanistan has never had a national railway network and while there are a few spur lines from neighboring countries, most notably to\u00a0Mazar-e Sharif, there are no passenger trains as of 2020. However there are several border towns with passenger trains, from where it&#8217;s possible to continue into Afghanistan on foot or by taxi.<br \/>\nAcross the border from\u00a0Northwest Afghanistan, the city of\u00a0Termez\u00a0in\u00a0Uzbekistan\u00a0sees trains from both\u00a0Moscow\u00a0and\u00a0Tashkent. From\u00a0Pakistan, it&#8217;s possible to take a train from\u00a0Quetta\u00a0to the border town of Chaman and continue into\u00a0South Afghanistan.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GET AROUND<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>By plane. <\/strong>Planes fly between Kabul and the major cities (Kandahar,\u00a0Herat\u00a0and\u00a0Mazar-e Sharif) at varying frequency. If weather is suitable, flights are operated daily. Most flights depart cities in the mornings before 11:00 only. Civilian airplanes are not operated after sundown.<br \/>\n<strong>By car.<\/strong> There is a growing network of public transportation between the country&#8217;s cities. Buses ply some routes and Toyota vehicles have a near monopoly on minivan (HiAce) and taxi (Corolla) transportation.<br \/>\nA new highway connects\u00a0Kabul\u00a0and\u00a0Mazar-i-Sharif. The highway is in good condition and is considered &#8220;relatively&#8221; safe. The trip takes a minimum of 5 hr. The highway goes through the famous Salang Mountains and cross the Hindu Kush mountain ranges. If you hire a\u00a0relatively\u00a0new Toyota Corolla, this would cost you about USD100 (if bargained by a local) for one direction from the\u00a0Mazar Station\u00a0in Kabul to anywhere in Mazar-i-Sharif.<br \/>\nThere is no metered taxi in large parts of Afghanistan. Taxis are yellow and clearly identifiable. You should normally strike a deal with the driver before you take a seat. You can consider 2\u20133\u00a0km of road in ideal conditions to be around USD1 worth (AFN50).<br \/>\nJeeps and Land Cruisers are available for hire along with drivers who speak some English (do not keep your hopes high that you might bump into one of them). There are tour operators in\u00a0Kabul\u00a0that can provide a car and guide; these people are available for hire at the Kabul International Airport itself. Petrol stations are scarce in the countryside, and fuel is expensive.<br \/>\nPaved roads are the exception, not the rule, and even those roads can be in poor repair. Once outside the major cities expect dirt roads (which turn to mud during rain or snow melt). The highway between Kabul and\u00a0Bagram\u00a0is dominated by military convoys and &#8220;jingle trucks&#8221;.<br \/>\nStay out of the way of military convoys. They travel slowly and are heavily armed. You are not permitted to overtake these vehicles. Driving too close or approaching quickly from behind will be interpreted by them as a hostile act, and they\u00a0will\u00a0open fire. Do\u00a0not\u00a0attempt to take photographs of these vehicles or attempt to operate your cell phone when they are around. They may assume you have a remote bomb-detonator and will feel threatened, and it is highly likely they will open fire at you.<br \/>\nA new highway links\u00a0Kabul\u00a0to\u00a0Kandahar. The highway is in good condition but should not be considered safe due to frequent attacks by anti-government forces such as the Taliban who often plant powerful mines (bombs) next to highways in which civilians are killed, and the poor standard of driving. The trip takes a minimum of 5 hours.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Money.<\/strong> The\u00a0Afghani\u00a0(AFN) is the currency of Afghanistan, denoted by the symbol &#8220;Afs&#8221; or &#8220;\u060b&#8221; (ISO code:\u00a0AFN).<br \/>\n<strong>Carpets.<\/strong> Afghanistan&#8217;s most famous products are\u00a0carpets. There are carpets described as &#8220;Afghan&#8221;, but also at least two other carpet-weaving traditions. The Baluchi tribes in the south and west weave fine rugs, and the Turkoman tribes in the north do as well; both groups are also found in neighbouring countries. All three types tend to use geometric patterns in the design, usually with red as the background colour and with repeated elements called &#8220;guls&#8221; to make the pattern. Generally, these are not as finely woven as carpets from the cities of neighbouring Iran. However, many of them are quite beautiful and their prices are (assuming good\u00a0haggling) well below those of the top Iranian carpets.<br \/>\nBaluchi rugs\u00a0are usually small since nomadic people cannot use large looms; sizes up to 1.5 by 2 metres are common and are popular with travellers because they are fairly portable. <strong>Afghan\u00a0sheepskin coat.<\/strong> These have the wool on the inside and often have lovely embroidery but this may hide flaws in the leather; top-quality coats will have little or no embroidery. Australian customs incinerate these coats on arrival<\/p>\n<p><strong>Eat.\u00a0<\/strong>Afghan cuisine includes a blend of Central, Eastern, South Asian, and Middle Eastern cuisines. Nearly all the dishes are non-spicy.<br \/>\n<strong>Drink.\u00a0<\/strong>Since Afghanistan is an Islamic country, alcohol consumption is illegal. However, it is tolerated in Western restaurants in\u00a0Kabul.<br \/>\n<strong>Sleep.\u00a0<\/strong>Hotels and guesthouses are available in all major cities, and while some may not meet international standards they are usually friendly and reliable.<br \/>\nWork.\u00a0Many foreigners are finding well-paid work in Afghanistan as part of the reconstruction efforts. Often with the UN or other non-governmental organisations. Most of these jobs are within\u00a0Kabul.<\/p>\n<p><strong>STAY SAFE<br \/>\n<\/strong>No part\u00a0of Afghanistan should be considered immune from violence, and the potential exists throughout the country for hostile acts, either targeted or random, at any time. Remnants of the former Taliban regime and the al-Qa&#8217;ida terrorist network, as well as other groups hostile to International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) military operations, remain active. Afghan authorities have a limited ability to maintain order and ensure the security of Afghan citizens and foreign visitors. Travel in all areas of Afghanistan is unsafe due to military combat operations, landmines, banditry, armed rivalry between political and tribal groups, and the possibility of insurgent attacks, including attacks using vehicle-borne or other improvised explosive devices (IEDs). The security situation remains volatile and unpredictable throughout the country, with some areas, especially in the southeast, experiencing substantially increased levels of violence.<br \/>\nAfghanistan is a volatile country, and downright dangerous in the southern and eastern areas.\u00a0Non-essential travel is\u00a0strongly\u00a0discouraged. Banditry is somewhat of an ancient tradition in many parts of the country, including in the northern areas. In addition to that, the Taliban insurgents have declared abduction of foreigners to be one of their primary goals. In July 2007, 23 South Koreans were kidnapped from a public bus in Ghazni province, south of Kabul. Two of them were murdered while the rest were set free several weeks later after controversial negotiations with the South Korean government.<br \/>\nThe <strong>northern part of the country<\/strong> is considered to be safer than the south and east; however,\u00a0occasional incidents can still occur anywhere and a seemingly safe place can become the opposite in an instant. Several reporters for German media were killed in the northern parts of Afghanistan, most likely by criminals or anti-westerners. 10 doctors (8 foreigners and 2 translators) were murdered in August 2010.<br \/>\n<strong>Landmines<\/strong> and other UXO (Unexploded Ordnance)\u00a0remain a problem across the country, so plan to\u00a0stick to well-worn paths, avoid red and white painted rocks, and do not touch or move any suspicious-looking item. According to the Afghan Red Crescent Society, approximately 600-700 people are injured or killed every year in accidents due to landmines and UXO. This is greatly reduced from over 1,600 in 2002. While travelling in Afghanistan you are likely to see mine clearance organisations at work.<br \/>\nInsects and snakes\u00a0are also something to be careful of, and the mountainous country has many vicious tiny creatures such as scorpions, spiders, centipedes, bees, etc.<br \/>\nIn some areas,\u00a0altitude sickness\u00a0is a significant risk.<br \/>\nHomosexual activity between consenting adults is punishable by an assortment of harsh punishments, including death, under Afghan law.\u00a0LGBT travelers should exercise tremendous discretion.<br \/>\nIf, after considering the risks, you still choose to travel in Afghanistan, hiring an armed escort or travelling with an experienced guide are ways to decrease the risks. You should also check with your embassy, and be clear on what they can and cannot do for you in an emergency.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Health.\u00a0<\/strong>Afghanistan has its fair share of health issues, and it would be wise to consult a travel doctor ahead of your trip about vaccinations and health risks. Respiratory diseases such as tuberculosis and food-related illness are common, and\u00a0malaria\u00a0is a risk in many parts of the country.<br \/>\nAfghanistan is one of the dustiest countries in the world, and you should be prepared to be covered in it and breathing it for most of your stay, even in the major cities. Pollution from diesel engines can also make life unpleasant.<br \/>\nFlies are notoriously heinous here, likely due to poor sanitation. Winter brings some relief, but they come back full-strength when spring arrives.<br \/>\nFood should be approached with a discerning eye, as hygiene standards can often be lacking. Hot, freshly cooked food is generally safer.\u00a0Bottled\u00a0water\u00a0is also advised, unless you have your own purification system.<br \/>\nBring any prescription medicine you may need from your home country, and don&#8217;t count on being able to find it locally. You may also consider carrying pain relievers and anti-diarrheals, as they&#8217;ll be hard to find outside of major cities.<br \/>\nSquat toilets are the norm, with toilet paper optional and sometimes scarce. Western-style toilets are seen occasionally in newer buildings and some private homes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>RESPECT<br \/>\n<\/strong>While the majority of women across Afghanistan still wear the\u00a0burqa\u00a0or\u00a0chadori, in cities like Kabul and Herat many opt for the Middle Eastern style hijab. Western women are highly encouraged to wear any type of head scarf (especially outside Kabul). As a general rule, the people get more conservative as you move further south.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CONNECT<br \/>\n<\/strong>Fixed line service is available in major cities (digital in\u00a0Kabul) and mobile phones in most cities. SIM cards are available and international calls to Europe\/US typically cost less than USD0.5\/minute. Outside of major cities your options are limited to a satellite phone.<br \/>\nAn Afghanistan number should is of the form\u00a0+93 30 539-0605\u00a0where &#8220;93&#8221; is the country code for Afghanistan, the next two digits are the area code and the remaining 7 digits are the &#8220;local&#8221; part of the subscriber number that can be called from within that particular area code using abbreviated dialing. You need to dial &#8220;0&#8221; in front of the geographic area code (of 20, 30, 40, 50 or 60 for fixed lines) from outside that particular area code (but when still within Afghanistan).<br \/>\nMobile phones. Mobile numbers in Afghanistan must always be dialled with all digits (10 digits, including a &#8220;0&#8221; prefixing the &#8220;70n&#8221; within Afghanistan), no matter where they are being called from. The\u00a070n\u00a0is a mobile prefix, not an &#8220;area code&#8221;, as such and the third digit (the\u00a0n\u00a0part) denotes the original mobile network assigned. An example mobile number looks like\u00a0+93 700-202-496.<br \/>\nRoshan\u00a0+93\u00a079 997 1333. The most reliable service with the widest coverage. SMS is possible to most countries.
