The first half of that sentence reflects the Beatles-era view of psychedelic drugs. The second is a new policy being pioneered in Oregon, which could herald a welcome shift in America more broadly.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"ds-layout-grid ds-layout-grid--edged layout-article-body\">\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">The view in the 1960s was that psychedelic drugs put users into an indolent, blissed-out state that encouraged them, in the words of an early booster, the one-time Harvard psychologist, Timothy Leary, to \u201cturn on, tune in, drop out\u201d. Unfortunately, the moral panic that this stirred up in the United States shut down research into the therapeutic possibilities of psychedelics and led the federal government to declare that they have \u201ca high potential for abuse and serve no legitimate medical purpose\u201d.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">That assessment was wrong, and the era of American moral panic over the drugs appears, at last, to be waning. Early next year, following the passage of a ballot measure in 2020 and under conditions currently being carefully worked out, Oregonians will be able to avail themselves of therapy using psilocybin, the psychoactive compound in \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/node\/21807474\" data-analytics=\"in_body:link_1:para_3\">magic mushrooms<\/a>\u201d. Several other states, including conservative ones such as Texas, have approved medical research into psychedelics. America\u2019s drugs regulator may approve\u00a0<small>MDMA<\/small>, better known as Ecstasy, for treating post-traumatic stress disorder as early as next year, and has hailed psilocybin as a \u201cbreakthrough therapy\u201d in treating severe depression. The European Medicines Agency is conducting large-scale trials of psilocybin to treat otherwise intractable depression.<\/p>\n<div class=\"advert incontent advert--inline\">\n<div>\n<div id=\"econ-1\" class=\"adcontainer\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">This new spirit of openness is inspired by the drugs\u2019 promise in the treatment of various maladies of the mind. Studies testifying to their benefits are admittedly small, but they are growing in number. What is more, the results are striking.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">The conditions that psychedelics seem to ameliorate include depression, addiction, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Precisely how they work is unclear, which is one reason more research is required. Users report an increased sense of connectedness, a decrease in anxiety (particularly for terminally ill patients nearing the end), and a reduction in depressive symptoms. It seems that these benefits persist. In one study, 14 months after taking psilocybin users reported a heightened sense of well-being and a belief that taking the drug was among the most meaningful experiences of their lives.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">It is true that the reported experiences are subjective, and some feelings may be suggested by people\u2019s expectations of how this sort of drug will affect them. But a number of things about psychedelics can be said with confidence. They are not addictive; consuming too much of them may be unpleasant but is not fatal; and any harm they cause is limited to the person taking them. At the very least\u2014as a comfortable majority of Oregon\u2019s voters realised in 2020 when, alongside legalising psychedelics, they decriminalised possessing small amounts of all drugs\u2014nobody should be imprisoned for using them.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">They certainly show enough promise to justify Oregon\u2019s experimental policy. Psilocybin will be available only in a licensed setting with a trained facilitator, after screening for contraindicative conditions such as schizophrenia or heart trouble. This reduces risk, and will foster networks of professionals who can learn from each other. It will also let people choose a setting that best suits them. Some may feel most comfortable in a surgery; others may prefer to be at a retreat in nature. Psilocybin is not intended to replace conventional therapies, but to sit alongside them; reaping the full benefits requires users to build the experience into their lives.<\/p>\n<h2>You answer quite slowly<\/h2>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Some may find psilocybin does not bring them all they hoped for. The drug is not a cure-all; and Oregon\u2019s policies may need to be tweaked. But the state\u2019s voters deserve praise for their clear-headed sense of proportion, too long absent from American drug policy. More states should follow Oregon\u2019s lead of cautious experimentation. Psychedelic drugs show tremendous promise. Initiatives like Oregon\u2019s are essential if they are to realise their potential to help those who today must bear their suffering<\/p>\n<div class=\"bp-mobileMDPlus bp-mobileLGPlus bp-tabletPlus bp-desktopPlus bp-desktopLGPlus bp-desktopXLGPlus no-touch\" data-fitt-page-type=\"article\">\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<div class=\"PageLayout page-container cf PageLayout--desktopLg PageLayout--article fitt-fade-in\">\n<div class=\"PageLayout__Main\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"main\">\n<div class=\"\">\n<div id=\"natgeo-template1-frame-1-module-1\" class=\"StackModule\">\n<div class=\"ScrollSpy_container\">\n<div class=\"Article flex ArticleBodyTile\">\n<section class=\"Article__Column Article__Column--main\">\n<article class=\"Article__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--content-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage ArticleBodyTile__Lead\" aria-label=\"Image Lead\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><picture><source srcset=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/4965a349-cc69-42cc-955b-f792aeb9e447\/Can-Psychedelics-Be-Used-to-Cure-the-Brain.jpg?w=374&amp;h=561, https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/4965a349-cc69-42cc-955b-f792aeb9e447\/Can-Psychedelics-Be-Used-to-Cure-the-Brain.jpg?w=748&amp;h=1122 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 374px)\" \/><source srcset=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/4965a349-cc69-42cc-955b-f792aeb9e447\/Can-Psychedelics-Be-Used-to-Cure-the-Brain.jpg?w=413&amp;h=619, https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/4965a349-cc69-42cc-955b-f792aeb9e447\/Can-Psychedelics-Be-Used-to-Cure-the-Brain.jpg?w=826&amp;h=1238 2x\" media=\"(max-width: 413px)\" \/><source srcset=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/4965a349-cc69-42cc-955b-f792aeb9e447\/Can-Psychedelics-Be-Used-to-Cure-the-Brain.jpg?w=636&amp;h=954, https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/4965a349-cc69-42cc-955b-f792aeb9e447\/Can-Psychedelics-Be-Used-to-Cure-the-Brain.jpg?w=1272&amp;h=1908 2x\" media=\"(min-width: 414px)\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/4965a349-cc69-42cc-955b-f792aeb9e447\/Can-Psychedelics-Be-Used-to-Cure-the-Brain.jpg?w=374&amp;h=561\" alt=\"The rings of a stump sit under mushrooms.\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/picture><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption Caption--hideEndBug\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">An earthy platter showcases the many shapes of the Hillbilly psychedelic mushroom.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><span class=\"RichText Caption__Credit\" aria-label=\"Photograph By MICHAEL CHRISTOPHER BROWN, nat geo image collection\">PHOTOGRAPH BY MICHAEL CHRISTOPHER BROWN, NAT GEO IMAGE COLLECTION<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<header class=\"Article__Header\">\n<div class=\"Article__Header__Branding\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Article__Headline\">\n<h1 class=\"Article__Headline__Title\">One way to heal a brain injury?

Now a growing number of scientists are exploring whether these powerful medicines might also treat physical injuries to the brain along with other disorders that result from different brain-wiring. This could have implications for stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI), as well as brain diseases including Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/header>\n<\/div>\n<section class=\"Article__Content\">Psychedelics are a class of compounds that alter consciousness, including lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin (aka magic mushrooms), methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA, or Ecstasy), dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and ayahuasca (derived from certain plants in South America), among others. Each affects the brain in slightly varied ways.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/doi.org\/10.3389\/fneur.2021.685085\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Most brain-injury research so far<\/a>\u2014conducted in test tubes and lab animals, with only a few small studies in people\u2014points to the psychedelics\u2019 potential to limit brain damage after injury, stimulate the birth of new neurons to replace impaired ones, and open the learning windows that let the brain acquire new skills.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41586-023-06204-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">One recent study<\/a>, published in the journal\u00a0<i>Nature<\/i>, found lab animals taking psychedelics adopted skills as adults that were previously limited to childhood.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy lab got really lucky when we discovered that psychedelics are the master keys for reopening critical periods that scientists have been looking for so long,\u201d says G\u00fcl D\u00f6len, an associate professor of neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, who coauthored the\u00a0<i>Nature<\/i>\u00a0article.<\/p>\n<p>These drugs could prove especially valuable because brain-injury conditions generally lack effective therapies, says Sunil Aggarwal, an integrative rehabilitation medicine physician in Seattle who coauthored a review of research on psychedelics for brain injuries\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8357986\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in the medical journal\u00a0<i>Frontiers in Neurology<\/i><\/a>. \u201cIt\u2019s still early on, but this is a very exciting time. There\u2019s a lot of interesting research that suggests this will be a really helpful treatment for these patients.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Expanding an injured brain\u2019s ability to learn<\/h2>\n<p>Human brains develop in a way that specific skills are most easily learned during targeted developmental stages, known as critical periods. People who attempt to learn a new language in adulthood tend to understand this concept, because the critical period for language\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S0010027718300994\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">closes<\/a>\u00a0after the teenage years.<\/p>\n<p>Yet this summer, the Johns Hopkins scientists reported that adult rodents given a psychedelic learned certain socialization skills that are typically acquired only as juveniles.<\/p>\n<p>Such an ability has implications for treating strokes and TBIs. When a person suffers these injuries, many neurons in the brain are damaged. Fortunately, a critical learning period for speech and motor skills reopens naturally following the event, enabling the person to regain some lost abilities. But it generally closes within six months, hindering improvement after that time.<\/p>\n<p>In the study, adult mice lacking certain social skills were trained to associate a specific environment with solitude and another with communal interaction. After they were given a single dose of LSD, psilocybin, or other psychedelic, they could choose to spend time in either environment. The majority preferred the social location.<\/p>\n<p>All the drugs had this effect, but those that produce the longest psychedelic experience in humans reopened the rodents\u2019 critical period for the longest duration afterwards. With LSD, for example, whose psychedelic effects last around 10 hours, the mice keep learning the value of socialization for months afterwards, compared to weeks for psychedelics producing shorter hallucinations.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat tells us the same mechanism is probably at work,\u201d D\u00f6len says. After autopsying the animals\u2019 brains, D\u00f6len discovered that the psychedelics seem to work by dissolving components around neurons that stabilize the memory encoded there\u2014a slurry of proteins, sugars, and other compounds known as the extracullar matrix. D\u00f6len likens this matrix to the grout between floor tiles, because when it is removed tiles can freely move about. In the brain, with the matrix weakened, the neurons are open to new learning.<\/p>\n<p>This likely happens because having psychedelics like LSD sit in their receptors so long overwhelms the neurons and causes them to hit a sort of reset button, like a hard reset after a computer freezes. The resulting cascade of cellular events reboots the brain back to an earlier developmental stage, D\u00f6len says.<\/p>\n<p>The reopening of learning windows seems to explain why psychedelic studies for mood disorders emphasize the importance of post-drug psychotherapy known as integration. As the brain is open to new ideas during integration it can approach its mental illness in novel ways, D\u00f6len says.

Research has shown that the brains of people with autism\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0149763421003134?via=ihub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bear some distinctions<\/a>\u00a0from those without the condition, especially in the frontal cortex that regulates emotions and relationships.<\/p>\n<p>In one study, eight adults with autism spectrum disorder experienced a marked\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/s00213-018-5010-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">decline in social anxiety<\/a>\u00a0after taking two doses of the psychedelic MDMA, each of which was followed by three psychotherapy sessions. The benefits of the therapy persisted through the six-month follow up, the University of California, Los Angeles study found.<\/p>\n<p>MDMA could be a particularly valuable psychedelic for autism because it facilitates the desire for socialization, a skill many on the spectrum find challenging, says Robert Malenka, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University who has performed animal research using the drug. \u201cUnder the influence of MDMA, one has this profound \u2026 sense of wanting to interact with other people in a non-aggressive, prosocial and empathic way,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>Andrew Amick, a 34-year-old Los Angeles office administrator training to become a psychotherapist, participated in the UCLA research. Before the study, contemplating even casual social situations like riding in an elevator with coworkers or passing them in the hall made him so anxious he took steps to avoid them.<\/p>\n<p>He remembers during the MDMA sessions focusing on the peaceful nature of the room, the soothing music, and his relaxed body. Afterwards, he realized that he could tap into these same sensations when interacting with people. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for me to choose to be peaceful in social situations,\u201d even six years later, Amick says. When he finds himself in his office elevator with colleagues, not only does he not feel compelled to run, but he can also comfortably start a conversation.<\/p>\n<h2>Helping the brain help itself<\/h2>\n<p>Other ways that psychedelics seem to impact the brain include reducing inflammation, a key perpetrator of the damage following a brain injury. While this swelling is a useful biological response to injured tissue because it accompanies immune cells and other healing chemicals that flood the area, too much is a serious problem.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe body needs to turn on the inflammation, but it also needs to turn it off,\u201d Aggarwal says. When it doesn\u2019t do the latter in a timely matter, neurons that escaped the initial injury can subsequently be damaged. One way that psychedelics decrease inflammation is by binding to serotonin receptors called 5-HT<sub>2A<\/sub>\u2014which are responsible for producing the hallucinogenic sensations and also regulate inflammation. Psychedelics additionally stimulate a brain protein called glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) that is responsible for the growth and recovery of injured neurons.<\/p>\n<p>Several labs are evaluating the psychedelic DMT as a possible medication to boost recovery after stroke. DMT works by stimulating another class of receptors called sigma-1 (S1R), which seem to be important for\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/s43440-021-00310-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">protecting cells from the injury<\/a> that occurs when blood reflows to the brain following a stroke.<\/p>\n<p>Rats slowly infused with low doses of DMT after a stroke had\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0014488620300765?via=ihub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fewer damaged tissues<\/a>\u00a0and more extensive recovery; brain levels of anti-inflammatory compounds and sigma-1 proteins were abundant in the treated animals.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe body has many intrinsic defense mechanisms, but in a stroke these systems get overwhelmed,\u201d says Christopher Bryan, vice president of research and operations for the Canadian company Algernon. His company is currently testing whether DMT could reduce this process in people.<\/p>\n<p>Algernon first studied healthy individuals to evaluate whether it is safe to infuse low doses of DMT over six hours. Results are unpublished, but Bryan says this delivery proved safe, enabling the company to soon begin clinical trials in hospitalized stroke patients. By slowly infusing the drug, Bryan says that patients get a therapeutic dose without triggering DMT\u2019s psychedelic effects, which could be jarring to someone recovering from a brain injury.<\/p>\n<h2>Treating the most challenging brain injuries<\/h2>\n<p>Traumatic brain injuries, which result from a violent blow to the head such as from a car accident or wartime explosive, are especially difficult to treat because multiple parts of the brain can be damaged. Nolan Williams, director of the Brain Stimulation Lab at Stanford University in California, was intrigued by ibogaine\u2019s potential after hearing stories of veterans with TBI going overseas to take the drug and returning with their memory and neurological functions dramatically improved. [Read more in\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/magazine\/article\/these-pioneering-therapies-are-treating-hard-to-heal-wounds-as-never-before\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">These Pioneering Therapies Are Treating Hard to Heal Wounds As Never Before<\/a>.]<\/p>\n<p>Williams recently conducted a clinical trial in which 30 veterans were administered ibogaine. Results have not been published, but mental processing skills improved for many of the vets, Williams told attendees at a recent Psychedelic Science conference in Denver. Moreover, brain scans found that blood flow to parts of the brain involved in rehabilitation increased.<\/p>\n<p>It may turn out that novel psychedelics engineered to remove the altered consciousness could prove particularly effective for brain injuries. That prospect was enhanced following recent research that found in addition to 5-HT<sub>2A<\/sub>\u00a0serotonin receptors, psychedelics also\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41593-023-01316-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bind<\/a>\u00a0to a receptor called TrkB (pronounced track B), which helps nerve cells communicate with one another. Antidepressants similarly activate this receptor, but psychedelics were found to be a thousand times more potent, says Eero Castr\u00e9n, a neuroscientist at the University of Helsinki in Finland who coauthored the study.<\/p>\n<p>TrkB does not cause hallucinogenic effects, meaning drugs engineered to bind to these receptors without activating 5HT<sub>2A<\/sub>\u00a0might produce similar healing. Although some people believe the psychedelic high is an important aspect in mood-disorder treatment, it may be less necessary for brain injuries, Castr\u00e9n says.

I was really afraid it wasn\u2019t going to come back,\u201d the 51-year-old San Diego attorney recalls. The nurse attending her session quickly called in the psychiatrist, who verbally reassured St.Clair and squeezed her hand to make her feel safe. His soothing presence kept her calm during the 40 minutes until the hallucination passed and the drug was out of her system.<\/p>\n<p>The importance of having well-trained professionals administer powerful psychedelic drugs is becoming urgent now. Not only will Oregon soon allow mental-health treatments with psilocybin\u2014the active ingredient in magic mushrooms\u2014but the United States Food and Drug Administration is expected to evaluate its first true psychedelic, methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA, aka ecstasy), for treating post-traumatic stress disorder later this year.<\/p>\n<p>It was the realization that psychedelics might one day be integrated into mainstream medical care that spurred the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco to become the first in the U.S. to offer a psychedelic-assisted therapy training program seven years ago, says Janis Phelps, director of the school\u2019s Center for Psychedelic Therapies and Research.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">A dose of psilocybin rests in a ceremonial chalice. Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In recent years, a growing number of institutions have followed. Psychotherapists, nurses, doctors, clergy, and others primarily in the mental health or spiritual professions are learning the chemistry of psychedelic molecules, safety concerns, historical Indigenous use, and, most importantly, the unique mental states unleashed by these drugs, whose effects last for six hours or more. But because psychedelics are currently illegal, no program enables participants to personally experience their effects.<\/p>\n<p>Demand for these courses is booming, experts say, in large part due to a better understanding of the drugs\u2019 potential mental health benefits. But national standards do not exist, leading to fears some graduates may have inadequate abilities as each institution create its own curriculum.<\/p>\n<h2>Inspired by promising clinical trials<\/h2>\n<p>Why are medical providers looking to MDMA as a potentially useful PTSD treatment? The powerful drug is thought to enable the brain to confront traumatic memories without triggering emotions like shame and rage, which can overwhelm and impede healing.<\/p>\n<p>Preliminary results from the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies\u2019 (MAPS) most recent large clinical trial confirm that two or three doses of MDMA\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/maps.org\/2023\/04\/05\/statement-maps-funded-phase-3-research-reports-results-from-long-term-observational-follow-up-study-on-mdma-assisted-therapy-for-ptsd\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reduced or eliminated<\/a>\u00a0PTSD.

(These findings were released in April on MAPS\u2019 website but have not been published in a medical journal.)<\/p>\n<p>Positive results were also noted in MAPS\u2019 first phase three clinical trial published in\u00a0<i>Nature Medicine<\/i>\u00a0in 2021, which showed that after three sessions of between 80 and 180\u2009milligram doses of MDMA, three preparatory therapy sessions, and nine sessions post-medication,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41591-021-01336-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">two-thirds<\/a>\u00a0of study participants no longer had PTSD.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--below-paragraph InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\" data-bumper-index=\"3\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/fbb269fb-0b03-4bba-b79c-89844561f771\/h_15697911.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=1702\" alt=\"A group stand, hands raised, in a circle around a setting of candles and flowers.\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">Staff and military veterans participate in a a candlelight ceremony to kick off a psychedelic retreat in Mexico.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<p>Institutions around the world are revealing psychedelics\u2019 promise for a range of mental-health disorders, including\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/02698811211073759?rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&amp;url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">depression<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1177\/02698811211044688\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">anxiety<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jamapsychiatry\/fullarticle\/2795625\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">addiction<\/a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1177\/0269881119897615?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reducing the fear\u00a0<\/a>of being diagnosed with a terminal disease.<\/p>\n<p>Results like these inspired Anthony Back, a doctor at the University of Washington School of Medicine, to take the California Institute training in 2020. The 60-year-old Back says growing up in the 1980s around prominent antidrug ads kept him from experimenting in his youth. But the scientific research convinced him \u201cthere\u2019s something really important here.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In Back\u2019s work as a palliative care physician, his primary goal is to reduce pain for patients with cancer. But \u201cwe haven\u2019t had good ways of dealing with the terror\u201d of learning your life is likely ending, he says.<\/p>\n<h2>How to administer a psychedelic drug<\/h2>\n<p>Institutions offering training programs vary greatly. Oregon has authorized nearly\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/psilocybin.oregon.gov\/training-approved\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">two dozen<\/a>\u00a0groups to conduct training for its statewide program, ranging from small facilities like the Earth Medicine Center to established universities including the University of California, Berkeley. Around the country, programs generally last six months to a year and cost thousands of dollars.<\/p>\n<p>Most programs emphasize the importance of conducting multiple sessions before a drug is administered to discuss what patients hope to gain from the experience and what they might expect. Students also learn how to oversee the one or more sessions where the drug is administered. \u201cThe psychedelic experience is largely an internal one,\u201d Phelps says, so therapists are taught not to interject themselves unless required to restore a sense of safety.<\/p>\n<p>Administering psychedelic-assisted therapy is vastly different for professionals used to conventional mental-health treatments, says Bit Yaden, a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins Medicine, who is working on a pilot curriculum for Hopkins, Yale, and New York University psychiatry students. \u201cWhen I prescribe Lexapro, my patient picks up the prescription and I hear in a month how it\u2019s going,\u201d she says. But with psychedelics, the actual dispensing of the medicine along with subsequent talk therapy are required, she says. During the many hours of a psychedelic session, one or more therapists must remain in the room.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop ImageGroup__Wrapper\" aria-label=\"Image Pair\" data-bumper-index=\"6\">\n<div class=\"ImageGroup__Images\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure id=\"ba9cfeb1-0ae9-4b77-9910-9e6f8564e46d_0\" class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/6728f797-7924-45c1-a968-6275d1d9a54f\/GettyImages-1298857823.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=3840\" alt=\"A close up view of an IV drop containing ketamine.\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure id=\"ba9cfeb1-0ae9-4b77-9910-9e6f8564e46d_1\" class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent\">\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/d9c9fe3e-82a5-4a71-a784-581c09dff0c8\/C0526767-Ketamine_crystals_light_micrograph.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=3840\" alt=\"Light micrograph of ketamine, crystallized from aqueous solution, showing hues of gold with streaks of blues and purples.\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption Caption--hideEndBug\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\"><strong>Left<\/strong>: Ketamine is administered via an intravenous drip at Palo Alto Mind Body. \u00a0To provide some understanding of a psychedelic experience, some programs encourage students to try ketamine to understand the extreme vulnerability of a being under the influence.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\"><strong>Right<\/strong>: This image is a light micrograph of crystalized ketamine.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<p>Trainees are also taught how to help with a process known as integration, where patients incorporate insights and emotions from their psychedelic trip into their everyday lives. Here too, conventional therapists can find themselves in novel territory. \u201cIn psilocybin trials, there are reports of people having mystical experiences. Talking about those experiences may not have traditionally fit in a psychotherapeutic framework,\u201d Yaden says.<\/p>\n<p>Some programs have adopted the belief that therapists are best positioned to help others process powerful insights only after they have dealt with their own mental-health issues. That\u2019s why Vancouver Island University in Canada offers a year-long training with numerous personal-development exercises and discussions to foster the personal and emotional growth of the therapist. \u201cUsing psychedelics is a way of remembering who you are,\u201d says Geraldine Manson, a member of Canada\u2019s Snuneymuxw First Nation who teaches in the program.<\/p>\n<h2>Training without psychedelics<\/h2>\n<p>Because psychedelics remain illegal, most programs are unable to have students facilitate an actual session with a psychedelic, an unfortunate limitation to their training, Phelps says. (Vancouver Island\u2019s students, however, can do so because of government waivers allowing some mental-health patients to legally use the drugs.)<\/p>\n<p>For the same reason, many students haven\u2019t had personal experience with the drugs either. \u201cIt is clear when someone has never used a psychedelic. The types of questions they ask shows they have no idea what experience they\u2019ll be providing to their patient,\u201d says Pam Kryskow, medical chair of the Vancouver Island program.<\/p>\n<p>Some encourage students to try ketamine under supervision to understand the extreme vulnerability of a being under the influence. Others attempt to simulate the state with a breathing practice known as Holotropic breathwork, which employs fast respiration to yield temporarily altered consciousness.<\/p>\n<p>Some trainees seek out their own psychedelic experience with an underground guide or through by traveling to countries where Indigenous populations have long used the drugs. Palliative-care physician Back used a guide several years ago, an experience that prompted his desire to take the training. During the experience, as he later\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.liebertpub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/jpm.2018.0561\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote<\/a>\u00a0in a medical journal, \u201cmy familiar sense of \u2018me\u2019\u2014my preferences, my body, my history\u2014dropped away, all at once, and what became palpable was an oceanic sensation of being unified with everything\u2026.There was a sense of being complete belonging\u2026of having access to an energy in the universe that normally was hidden. It was exhilarating.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Back believes such a framework would be helpful for his terminal patients. \u201cI realized the process of dying was much more spiritual than I knew,\u201d he now says, and he is eager for these drugs to be legalized.<\/p>\n<p>Other medical professionals apparently feel similarly. In the California Institute\u2019s first class of 42 students, several doctors and nurses insisted their participation be kept quiet to avoid potential harm to their professional reputations. But this year, some 800 people competed for the school\u2019s 400 slots.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the growth, experts worry there won\u2019t be enough trained therapists to meet the expected demand after FDA approval of MDMA and possibly psilocybin, when thousands of professionals will be needed. In Oregon, not a single facilitator has so far met all criteria to be granted a license for psilocybin therapy.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;No training program is keeping up with the demand,\u201d Phelps laments. Her university is developing a licensing program so other colleges can obtain the school\u2019s training materials and videos, with some 25 already expressing interest, she says.<\/p>\n<p>The only way psychedelics can succeed as a mental-health remedy is by ensuring enough professionals receive high-quality training, Back says. \u201cThis is a different kind of treatment than most others. Those are about the technology or the drug. Here, you have to have the therapy and the medicine together.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<\/article>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/article>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Psychedelic therapy shows great promise.
