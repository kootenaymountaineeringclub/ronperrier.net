Eritrea was awarded to Ethiopia in 1952 as part of a federation. Ethiopia&#8217;s annexation of Eritrea as a province ten years later sparked a 30-year struggle for independence, which ended in 1991 with Eritrean rebels defeating Ethiopian and Ethiopian-backed forces. Independence was overwhelmingly approved in a 1993 referendum, administered by the UN.<br \/>\nHopes were high when the new state was born but a new border war with Ethiopia erupted again in 1998 and ended only under UN auspices in December 2000. Eritrea briefly hosted a UN peacekeeping operation that monitored a 25 km-wide Temporary Security Zone on the border with Ethiopia. An international commission, organized to resolve the border dispute, posted its findings in 2002. However, final demarcation is on hold due to Ethiopian objections, and the border remains very tense to this day. Eritrea has since expelled the peacekeepers due to lack of support from the UN in having the border ruling enforced.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Climate. <\/strong>Hot, dry desert strip along Red Sea coast; cooler and wetter in the central highlands (up to 610mm of rainfall annually); semiarid in western hills and lowlands; rainfall heaviest during June-September except in the coastal desert. Massawa, the tropical beach area is usually a very humid and hot atmosphere. Asmara highs to 32 \u00b0C lows to 21 \u00b0C usually followed by rain in the winter.<br \/>\n<strong>Landscape. <\/strong>Bordering Ethiopia, there are north-south trending highlands, descending on the east to a coastal desert plain, on the northwest to hilly terrain and on the southwest to rolling plains.<br \/>\nEritrea is relatively small), about the same size as\u00a0Pennsylvania\u00a0or\u00a0England.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0highlands\u00a0in the center and south of Eritrea, the\u00a0western lowlands, the\u00a0Sahel\u00a0in the north, the subtropical\u00a0eastern escarpments, the\u00a0northern coast and archipelago\u00a0and the\u00a0southern coast.<br \/>\n<strong>The\u00a0highlands,<\/strong> with\u00a0Asmara, 1500 \u2013 3500m asl has a Mediterranean and dry climate, with little seasonal variation in temperature. Rainy season May \u2013 September, dry season December to April. The landscape essentially consists of valleys, hills and vast expanses of plateaus interrupted by dramatic chasms and gorges. The dry season has red-brown, rusty, beige or black landscape, vegetation consists of shrubbery, eucalyptus, aloes, cacti and colorful bougainvillea, jacaranda or other ornamental plants. The rainy season brings verdant, emerald and grassy landscape in the post-rain months from August to October.<br \/>\nRural highlanders live a lifestyle, which resembles Biblical times: villages with stone houses, small plots, ancient temples (both Christian and Muslim), people farming and herding with traditional means using little technology, and transporting their goods (as well as themselves) with mules and camels. A good place to explore the highland landscape is in the outskirts of\u00a0Asmara, the capital. Near the village of Tselot is the\u00a0Martyrs National Park, inaugurated in 2000. It is a mountainous forest and wildlife preserve at the ridge of the highland plateau where the capital was built.<br \/>\n<strong>Tessenei<\/strong>\u00a0market town\u00a0 by the Sudanese border lies between the dry and green parts of the lowlands. Place of trade for the nomadic peoples of the desert and the sedentary farming communities of the Savannah. It is accessible by asphalt road from Asmara\u00a0via\u00a0Keren 10 hours. Buses run daily from Asmara. It can also be reached by dirt track from the Sudanese city of\u00a0Kassala\u00a0only 40 km (25 mi) away. Considering the border bureaucracy, this short distance could however prove to be a whole day&#8217;s endeavor.<br \/>\n<strong>The\u00a0Sahel<\/strong>\u00a0in northern Eritrea consists of a narrow chain of mountains 1000 to 2500m high. The landscape is very arid and fit for only the most tenacious of nomadic herding communities. The central and northern core consists of impenetrable and hair-raising mountain passes, gorges and valleys. This was the main base for the Eritrean rebels (who now make up the country&#8217;s government) when they fought against Ethiopia for Eritrea&#8217;s independence. The best place to explore the Sahel is the town of\u00a0Nakfa,<br \/>\n<strong>Dahlak islands.<\/strong> The beaches are clean, white and pristine, with lagoons of clear turquoise water. The only way here is to charter a boat in Massawa. The biggest island Dahlak Kebir, which features one modest resort-hotel is only 90 km away.<br \/>\n<strong>Southern coast<\/strong>\u00a0is dramatic and inhospitable with volcanoes, quicksand, bubbling sulfuric mud pools, salt lakes, coastal cliffs and inland depressions.

When you apply for a visa to Eritrea, you must do it at an Eritrean diplomatic mission in &#8211; or accredited to &#8211; the country where you are a citizen and\u00a0nowhere else.<br \/>\nVisas are supposedly available on arrival in Eritrea, on condition that you have a local sponsor and that s\/he has filed a letter of sponsorship with the Eritrean Immigration Authority 48 hours before your arrival. It would be best to get a visa before arriving in the country. Journalists may struggle to get a visa.<br \/>\nThere&#8217;s a travel agency based in Asmara called Asmara Grande (www.asmaragrande.com) to to help with a visa on arrival for tourism purposes, hotel bookings, airport pickups, transport and permits to travel to Massawa,Keren etc.etc. You can contact Mr.Tekeste Asghedom at\u00a0faidex@gemel.com.er\u00a0or\u00a0asmaragrande@gemel.com.er<br \/>\n<strong>By Plane.\u00a0<\/strong>EgyptAir\u00a0serves Asmara daily from\u00a0Cairo.

Renting a cab to drive you around town is also quite expensive, but affordable. Be prepared to pay around 3000 &#8211; 6000 Nakfa for a weekend with a driver. It is perhaps better to take the bus or contact one of the national tour agencies (ask at the information desk at the airport upon arrival).<br \/>\n<strong>By train. <\/strong>A vintage train line from Asmara to Massawa takes 2 hours.<br \/>\nTo travel anywhere outside Asmara (other than Martyr&#8217;s National Park), you need to get permits from the Ministry of Tourism. They are issued usually the same day. Without a permit no hotel will accept you.<br \/>\n<strong>Talk. <\/strong>Eritrea has no official language. Tigrinya\u00a0serves as the de facto language of national identity. Other national languages of the various ethnic groups of Eritrea include\u00a0Tigre,\u00a0Kunama,\u00a0Saho,\u00a0Bilen,\u00a0Nara, and\u00a0Afar.<br \/>\nArabic\u00a0and\u00a0English\u00a0serve as de facto working languages.\u00a0Italian, the former colonial language, is widely used in commerce, with a few elderly monolinguals.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SEE<br \/>\n<\/strong>Asmara clean, tranquillity and architectural style, what it makes it unique and so lovely are the public buildings, villas, and mansions of Art Deco (or Decorative Art). They were built from different architectural styles ranging from Art Deco to Futuristic and Rationalist .<br \/>\nArt Deco built in the first four decades of the 20th century by mass labor force of its native people, and with few Italian lire and engineers. Most Art Deco buildings in the world are found in few cities. In Asmara, they are intact, preserved and old.<br \/>\nAsmara Cathedral\u00a0&#8211; with a bell tower that reaches high into the sky, the Cathedral of Asmara is a sterling piece of Lombard-Romanesque architecture and a useful bearing point for lost travelers.<br \/>\nEnda Mariam Orthodox Cathedral (St. Mary)\u00a0&#8211; The ancient church is located at the center of the city and symbolizes the four directions of the earth (east, west, north and south) the four gates on each direction haver an equal number of worshipers passing through them every day.<br \/>\nAt the compound of this church you will find a tree called &#8220;Berberestelim&#8221; long ago priests use to wash dead bodies by adding these tree leaves into the water and the body stays as it is for years.<br \/>\nAsmara Theatre and Opera House\u00a0&#8211; Constructed in 1920, the Asmara Opera House is an amazing Italian Architectural piece.<br \/>\nAl Khulafa Al Rashiudin Mosque\u00a0&#8211; Is one of the most elegant Mosques in Africa. The architecture is eclectic a mix Italian and local Moorish styles.<br \/>\nFiat Tagliero\u00a0&#8211; One a very few futuristic architectural pieces ever built in the World. It is an old service station designed to look like an airplane.

No rental bikes<br \/>\n<strong>Money. <\/strong>Eritrean Nakfa pegged 15 Nakfas to the USD.<br \/>\nThe black market used to offer much better rates, but the difference between the official and the black market rates has narrowed and more difficult outside Asmara. Eritrea is all cash &#8211; foreign credit and debit cards are not accepted anywhere.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sleep<\/strong>. Some hotels have one price for foreigners and another for locals. In most smaller towns, the lodging is quite modest and priced accordingly &#8211; shared bathroom, no room-service, a common room TV, no air-conditioning and no change of sheets or cleaning throughout occupancy. In a hot place like Massawa, recommend a mid-range hotel with air-conditioning<br \/>\n<strong>Stay safe.<\/strong> Eritrea is generally safe and you can walk about at night and anywhere in the cities and not worry about crime.<br \/>\n<strong>Health. <\/strong>Do not drink the tap water. Practice safe sex, adult HIV\/AIDS is currently 0.8%, so not an issue.<br \/>\n<strong>Respect. <\/strong>Eritreans are polite, hospitable and soft-spoken but nowhere near as friendly, vivacious and open as most other Africans. Instead, they are generally reserved, sometimes even a little bit aloof.<br \/>\nUsing the black market to change money may be unavoidable given the unattractive official rate, but it is not without risk. A) People offering to change money could be undercover government agents, who can land you in severe trouble with the zero-tolerance Eritrean justice system, or B) Even if they are not, you run the risk of not receiving a fair trade or getting caught by the law, which is something you must avoid at all costs in Eritrea.<br \/>\nIt is rude to take pictures of people or their property without asking for permission.<\/p>\n<p><strong>NM Eritrea<br \/>\n<em>Experiences<br \/>\n<\/em>Ashenda.\u00a0<\/strong>A\u00a0festival\u00a0celebrated in northern Ethiopia among\u00a0Orthodox Christianity\u00a0that commemorates the heavenly ascension of the\u00a0Virgin Mary\u00a0following her\u00a0Dormition.
