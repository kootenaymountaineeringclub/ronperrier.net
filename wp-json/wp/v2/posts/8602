International Basin, at the headwaters of Bobbie Burns Creek, is a good camping spot.

Backpack over the glacial pass just east of David Peak, and contour southwest on high alpine meadows. It is a moderate day\u2019s trip. To gain upper Carbonate Glacier, and the high peaks, utilize the prominent rocky ridge leading to the northwest corner of the icefield.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">An old mining road (a good trail now) goes up the north side of Bobbie Burns Creek to its head (and also an old road up Carbonate Creek branching from Bobbie Burns Creek; this road does not extend all the way up Carbonate Creek) and the lower road\u2019s condition is unknown (see the Vermont Group).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Duncan River road (FSR), starting from Kootenay Lake, passes on the western edge of the group, and other groups in the Northernmost Purcells.

There is a cabin near the headwaters of Bobbie Burns Creek in International Basin which sleeps six people (250-342-5005; fee).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The party of 2002 flew into International Basin from km 57 (35.4 miles) on the Spillimacheen River Forest Service Road. One and a half days were necessary to walk out to the vehicles on Spillimacheen River (camp below Spillimacheen Glacier, north of David Peak).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There is a pass from Malachite Creek to Carbonate Creek on the southwest end of Carbonate Mountain, above the Carbonate Creek road (tiny hut; mentioned above and in the Spillimacheen Group also) at 966-482, leading to Bobbie Burns Creek (good trail up).<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The limits of the Carbonate Group are Bobbie Burns Creek on the northwest and north, Duncan River on the west, Hatteras and Syncline Creeks on the south, and Malachite Creek on the southeast.
