Data on the number of fentanyl users are scarce, as are data on prices and purity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"css-1f0x4sl e1tt35bk0\" data-component=\"paragraph\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/united-states\/2023\/02\/02\/medication-for-opioid-addiction-is-getting-easier-to-access\" data-analytics=\"in_body:link_3:para_6\">Addiction treatment<\/a>\u00a0has been expanding for years. But the drop in deaths is too sudden and too widespread (almost all states have experienced it) to be primarily down to this. There has been no dramatic increase in prescriptions of anti-addiction drugs, either. More naloxone kits (an injection which can reverse an overdose, first approved under the brand name Narcan) are being distributed. That must be helping, but also cannot fully explain the drop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"css-1f0x4sl e1tt35bk0\" data-component=\"paragraph\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">One possibility is a supply shock. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, which polices drug smuggling, the amount of fentanyl in pills they intercept has fallen. Some reports suggest the Sinaloa cartel, a huge Mexican organised-crime group, has stepped back from smuggling fentanyl because of American pressure. In July two high-ranking members, including the son of El Chapo, one of Sinaloa\u2019s founders, were arrested. Experts however say it is far too early to be sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"css-1m7l96h e18kpe851\">\n<figure class=\"css-j0a8mg e1197rjj0\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto\/content-assets\/images\/20241221_USC205.png\" sizes=\"auto, 300px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=16,quality=80,format=auto\/content-assets\/images\/20241221_USC205.png 16w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=32,quality=80,format=auto\/content-assets\/images\/20241221_USC205.png 32w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=48,quality=80,format=auto\/content-assets\/images\/20241221_USC205.png 48w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=64,quality=80,format=auto\/content-assets\/images\/20241221_USC205.png 64w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=96,quality=80,format=auto\/content-assets\/images\/20241221_USC205.png 96w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=128,quality=80,format=auto\/content-assets\/images\/20241221_USC205.png 128w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=256,quality=80,format=auto\/content-assets\/images\/20241221_USC205.png 256w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=360,quality=80,format=auto\/content-assets\/images\/20241221_USC205.png 360w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=384,quality=80,format=auto\/content-assets\/images\/20241221_USC205.png 384w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=480,quality=80,format=auto\/content-assets\/images\/20241221_USC205.png 480w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=600,quality=80,format=auto\/content-assets\/images\/20241221_USC205.png 600w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=834,quality=80,format=auto\/content-assets\/images\/20241221_USC205.png 834w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=960,quality=80,format=auto\/content-assets\/images\/20241221_USC205.png 960w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto\/content-assets\/images\/20241221_USC205.png 1096w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto\/content-assets\/images\/20241221_USC205.png 1280w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto\/content-assets\/images\/20241221_USC205.png 1424w\" width=\"608\" height=\"778\" data-nimg=\"1\" \/><\/span><figcaption class=\"css-18w36g1 egmy3ck2\"><span class=\"css-4n0fre egmy3ck1\" style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Chart: The Economist<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"css-1f0x4sl e1tt35bk0\" data-component=\"paragraph\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Another possibility is that the decline represents a return to pre-pandemic norms. When covid-19 hit, opioid overdoses soared. It is hard to say why, but feels intuitive: hospitals were full of covid patients, many treatment centres had shut, and more people were experiencing the sort of traumatic losses that can make them turn to drugs. If this is the primary reason, the current decline will level off, and seems unlikely to keep falling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"css-1f0x4sl e1tt35bk0\" data-component=\"paragraph\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">If this is instead a sustained drop, look to a third explanation. Though deaths have fallen in most of the country, the steepest improvements have been in places that were hit especially early, particularly in Appalachia and the Midwest. In Ohio, which covers both regions, the number of deaths dropped by a quarter in the year to July, the second biggest improvement of any state (North Carolina\u2019s was even steeper).<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"adComponent_advert__kPVUI adComponent_incontent__boSCu css-0 e1cbnkh80\">\n<div>\n<div id=\"econ-2\" class=\"adComponent_adcontainer__eooQr\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">The epidemic may simply be \u201cburning out\u201d, suggests Professor Ciccarone. The theory is that the most vulnerable have already died, that those left behind understand the danger from fentanyl, and so new addicts do not replace them.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"css-1f0x4sl e1tt35bk0\" data-component=\"paragraph\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">For a sense of why this is plausible, a visit to Butler County, Ohio\u2014of which Hamilton is the seat\u2014is instructive. The county (where J.D. Vance, the vice president-elect, grew up) is a sprawl of farmland and industrial towns north of Cincinnati. It was also early to the opiates boom (in the 1990s Mr Vance\u2019s mother, who worked as a nurse, was among the first to get addicted to pain pills). Now, it is among the places improving fastest in America.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"css-1f0x4sl e1tt35bk0\" data-component=\"paragraph\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">So far this year, there have been 88 suspected overdose deaths in the county, down from 130 last year. In 2017, the county\u2019s worst year on record, there were 236. \u201cWe never thought we would see this drop this fast,\u201d says Jordan Meyer, an epidemiologist at the county\u2019s health district, which distributes Narcan kits and fentanyl testing strips. That must have helped. But the biggest change in Butler county is how drug users are behaving.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"css-1f0x4sl e1tt35bk0\" data-component=\"paragraph\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cIt\u2019s fear\u201d, says Dave Hawley, the clinical supervisor at River Rocks Recovery, a treatment centre in Middletown. In a place like Middletown, almost everybody will know somebody who has died of an overdose recently, he says. With the rise of fentanyl, \u201cIt\u2019s not about riding the edge anymore\u201d. Even hardened addicts are taking more precautions than they used to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"css-1f0x4sl e1tt35bk0\" data-component=\"paragraph\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A few years ago the main way to take fentanyl was by injecting it. Now addicts are taking pills or smoking it, which is less risky. Xylazine, a veterinary sedative, is also increasingly mixed with fentanyl into a potent cocktail known as \u201ctranq\u201d. Tranq comes with awful costs\u2014injecting it can lead to flesh-rotting infections\u2014but curiously it may be helping some users to avoid taking too much fentanyl.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"css-1f0x4sl e1tt35bk0\" data-component=\"paragraph\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">According to Mr Hawley, many fentanyl addicts have switched to taking methamphetamine. This is used either as a straight substitute or to help ease withdrawal or overcome cravings. Meth is extremely unhealthy. But in the short term, it is cheap and lasts a long time, and the overdose risk is smaller; if you are in opioid withdrawal, it can give you the energy to go to work. Of the fentanyl overdoses still happening in Butler county, half now also include methamphetamine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"css-1f0x4sl e1tt35bk0\" data-component=\"paragraph\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Drug epidemics can be depressingly persistent. Deaths have recently risen in Scotland, one of very few other places to suffer an overdose death rate comparable to America\u2019s. But in most of Europe, the 1980s heroin boom faded away. Memories last longer than funding streams or police successes. At the treatment centre in Hamilton, Mr Weaver says he too thinks people have learned from the awful experience of the past few years. \u201cIt\u2019s just more people who want to get their lives back together\u201d, he says. Drugs offered an escape from the monotony and trauma of daily life. But fentanyl was, perhaps, just too much.\u00a0<span class=\"ufinish\">\u25a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Through the eye of the needle Is the opioid epidemic finally burning out?
