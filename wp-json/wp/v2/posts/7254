Class 3. Done on May 31, 1992 with Howie Ridge and Dave Adams. On return we traversed Ymir Mtn.

Thence to the summit without incident (4 hrs. from the lodge). Done solo on June 4, 1995. Class 3, almost all on snow. Howie and Dave had made a ski ascent of this peak exactly three weeks before; I could still see their tracks. This peak looks a little like Devil&#8217;s Couch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">On return I traversed &#8220;Qua Peak,&#8221; descending my up-tracks to the connecting ridge, then working up snow and rock on the S. side to the summit in 45 min.

Good snow conditions. Both these peaks are best done in May and June to take advantage of easy travel on snow. Class 3 for the traverse.
