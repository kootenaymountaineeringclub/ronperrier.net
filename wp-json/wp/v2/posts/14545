People.<\/strong> Generally very nice and helpful. The touts can get to you &#8211; mainly taxi drivers, horse and carriage drivers and feluccas in Aswan. My way of dealing with them is generally to ignore them as that makes for the shortest interactions. Even saying &#8220;No thank you&#8221; tends to not stop them. Then they say &#8220;Tomorrow?&#8221;.<br \/>\nThe universal greeting is &#8220;Welcome&#8221; and then &#8220;Country?&#8221;. To Canada, they universally say &#8220;Canada Dry&#8221;.

Use Uber in Cairo and InDrive in Aswan for taxis. A SIM card \/10 GB data is $10 and top up $4 (Vodafone).<br \/>\nTours however are expensive. I paid $250 for the long one-day drive to Kharga from Luxor (no bus) and $250 for the car\/driver to Valley of the Kings, Luxor to Kom Ombo and then a felucca for 2 days\/1 night. And then there is always a tip expected.

Located about 2.5 km southeast of Dendera (north of Luxor), inhabited in prehistory and is a useful oasis on the banks of the Nile. It is one of the best-preserved temple complexes in Egypt. Pepi I (ca. 2250 BC) built the first and the earliest extant building the mammisi raised by Nectanebo II \u2013 the last of the native pharaohs (360\u2013343 BC).<br \/>\nNearby is the\u00a0Dendera necropolis, a series of\u00a0mastaba\u00a0tombs.

The temple is among the best preserved in Egypt with fine decorations and original colours. It has 12 underground crypts. It continued to be used til the era of the Roman emperor Trajan. This site is also part of a later TWHS: Pharaonic temples in Upper Egypt from the Ptolemaic and Roman periods.<br \/>\nThe sculptured\u00a0Dendera zodiac\u00a0(or Denderah zodiac) is a widely known relief found in a late Greco-Roman temple, containing images of\u00a0Taurus\u00a0(the\u00a0bull) and the\u00a0Libra\u00a0(the\u00a0balance).<br \/>\nThe Roman\u00a0mammisi\u00a0is a subsidiary building dating to the reigns of\u00a0Trajan\u00a0and\u00a0Marcus Aurelius.

One of the oldest cities of\u00a0ancient Egypt, it is 11 kilometres west of the\u00a0Nile. It was a sacred city and the site of many ancient\u00a0temples, including\u00a0Umm el-Qa&#8217;ab, a royal\u00a0necropolis\u00a0where early\u00a0pharaohs\u00a0were entombed.\u00a0These tombs began to be seen as extremely significant burials and in later times it became desirable to be buried in the area, leading to the growth of the town&#8217;s importance as a cult site.<br \/>\nToday, Abydos is notable for the memorial temple of\u00a0Seti I, which contains an inscription from the\u00a0Nineteenth Dynasty\u00a0known to the modern world as the\u00a0Abydos King List. It is a chronological list showing\u00a0cartouches\u00a0of most dynastic\u00a0pharaohs\u00a0of Egypt from\u00a0Menes\u00a0until Seti I&#8217;s father,\u00a0Ramesses I.\u00a0It is also notable for the\u00a0Abydos graffiti, ancient Phoenician and Aramaic graffiti found on the walls of the\u00a0Temple of Seti I.<br \/>\nThe Great Temple and most of the ancient town are buried under the modern buildings to the north of the Seti temple.

Industries include pottery. The local economy was hit by the\u00a0Luxor massacre\u00a0in 1997, where 64 people (including 59 visiting tourists) were killed, at the time the worst terrorist attack in Egypt (before the\u00a0Sharm el-Sheikh terrorist attacks).\u00a0The massacre reduced tourist numbers for several years.\u00a0Following the 2011\u00a0Arab Spring, tourism to Egypt dropped significantly, again affecting local tourist markets.<br \/>\nA controversial tourism development plan aims to transform Luxor into the biggest vast open-air museum: new roads, five-star hotels, glitzy shops, and an IMAX theatre. The main attraction is to restore the 2.7 kilometres long Avenue of Sphinxes that once linked Luxor and Karnak temples.

Also 7000 year old petroglyphs of giraffes.<br \/>\nThe above is a description from Wikipedia and bears little resemblance to what is here. There certainly is no museum with crocodiles. It is primarily a rock quarry, one of a hundred along the Nile that supplied sandstone for temples from Aswan to Cairo.<br \/>\nStop at the office and pay the ticket 40EP. Two guys accompanied me and opened the gate to enter the first shrine. Walk a long way along the sandy trail just above the river and at the base of the cliffs. Pass many small sections (sometimes only one block large) of quarries used to cut rock to the end of the trail where there are two large quarry sites. At one place are some partially cut large blocks &#8211; the cut line is about 3&#8243; wide.<br \/>\n<em><strong>Shrine of Horemheb.<\/strong><\/em> The only significant structure is an elaborate cave cut into the rock. Five large portals enter a long corridor with a round ceiling. A small side room exits off the back. All surfaces are covered with hieroglyphics especially good in the small room. One niche has a defaced statue. It is quite lovely.<br \/>\n<em><strong>Royal Stelae.<\/strong><\/em> Three 10-foot tall base relief carvings in the face of the cliff.<br \/>\n<em><strong>Shrines of the Officials and of the Nile<\/strong><\/em>. There are many small &#8220;caves&#8221; cut into the side and these may be two of them but none are signed, as two are elaborately painted. At the end, we climbed down a steep break in the cliff to another small shrine, also well-painted.<br \/>\nThe quarries here are very large extending up the cliff in steps. These were cut out from above down. The stone is rough from the chisel marks and would have been dressed smooth. It was very intensive work.<\/p>\n<p><em>To get to<\/em><em> Kom Ombo, <\/em><em>take the good road south, cross to the west side of the Nile over a large bridge and pass-through this unattractive big city to the Temple on the river. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>\u2022 <\/strong><\/em><strong>Kom Ombo<\/strong> lies a few hours upstream from Edfu, also near a sizeable town with the temple directly on the eastern bank resembling a Greek temple with many columns.\u00a0\u00a0A double-temple, it is dedicated to two gods: Horus (like in Edfu) and Sobek, the crocodile god (one of the few places in Egypt where a cult around crocodiles developed). A live specimen used to live inside, and when it died it was mummified and replaced by another living crocodile. A number of the crocodile mummies can be seen at the on site museum.<br \/>\nKom Ombo has a fine example of a Nilometer (that measured the height of the river\u2019s water level), and numerous interesting bas-reliefs in good condition. The display of surgical equipment is possibly the best-known of them. After 3.30 p.m. large cruise ships arrive. 160 EP<\/p>\n<p><em>The felucca captain met me in the parking lot of the temple and I said goodbye to Rageb. He was the best driver I have ever had. He drove fast, navigated all the speed bumps at more than a bare crawl and was happy to accommodate all my wishes. I gave him 600 EP tip.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>I saw the temple and we went down to the river to a speed boat that carried us about 5 km upstream to the felucca.<\/em><br \/>\n<strong>Felucca cruise up the Nile to Aswan.<\/strong> I frankly had no idea what was to happen. A felucca is a small sailboat about 15m long with one huge triangular sail. Akmed (the captain) and Bamab (the helper) pulled the sail completely to the top of the very long mast and unfurled the sail. There was a light breeze, but with Bamab on the large tiller, we made reasonable time. Akmed said if there was no wind, it could take more than two days to get to Aswan.<br \/>\nThis is Akmed&#8217;s first trip in 3 months &#8211; he has been at home repairing his boat, sewing a new sail, painting everything and cleaning the bottom. The boat is beautiful, all freshly painted yellow with a large covered area filled completely with mattresses. It is wonderfully quiet with only some creaking from the tiller and the motor noise from all the cruise ships going both ways. Something with a loud motor passes every 15 minutes. Most look not very busy. Several trains pass in one day. The passenger train (probably the common way for low-end tourists to travel on) has 14 cars. It runs from Cairo to Aswan.<br \/>\nWe sail close to shore to avoid the current. Running the tiller requires constant attention adjusting both the sail and rudder to achieve maximum speed (with no wind, we will never get to Aswan).<br \/>\nBamab has a sore back when working. After a history and physical, he has a muscle strain\/overuse issue. When Akmed is on the tiller, he sails completely differently. He sits with the tiller under his arm. A rope used to move the sail is tied around the end of the tiller. If knotted, then he doesn&#8217;t have to use his body to keep the tiller at the right angle. Even though Bamab has been sailing with Akmed for 20 years, it appears he still doesn&#8217;t do his job right to protect his back.<br \/>\n<em>Akmed speaks very good English and we converse easily. He is 45 and missing half his teeth, but is a smart guy. It is not long before we are smoking hashish. He is happy that I have no time frame as it might take us three days to get to Aswan. With good wind, we will overnight in his village where a wedding was going on.<br \/>\n<\/em>The bank is lined with a sloping rock wall and a big pile of loose rock before the water. Without the boat wash would cause a lot of erosion. The bank is about 10m high and covered in long flowering grass with palm trees on the land.<br \/>\n<em>A late lunch was a pita with beans, chopped salad, cold French fries, felafel, and shakshuka, which all made it better.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>At dusk, we became becalmed, Bamab poled for a while, and we pulled into a tiny sheltered bay and pulled in the sail. Mosquitoes. At 9, the wind returned and we sailed by starlight. I had a mosquito net (and had not used it in 3 months), but just used repellant. By ten we were parked again for the night.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em><br \/>\n<\/em><strong>Day 10<\/strong> Thur Dec 15<em><br \/>\nI was up at 3 and 7 and the boys slept in till almost 9. Akmed went to get groceries for BF and we were finally off in a good wind by 10. I feel weird with nothing to do but read. It seems I must be doing something to be complete. Akmed walks to a little village to buy BF stuff and cigarettes. The wind is up and we miss a good hour of it, but they are in no rush. Finally, we are off at almost 10.<br \/>\nWhen I ask if we are going to get to Aswan today, they answer Inshallah. like they answer most questions. &#8220;Depends on the wind&#8221;! They had to lower the mast to get under the large modern bridge (The main mast is 40% the length of the sail mast which is hinged to the top of it. They lower the sail mast till horizontal to get under the bridge). We were in Aswan by 1 pm. Akmed pled for a larger tip (I gave him 400 EP, all my cash) and wanted to go to the bank. They don&#8217;t own the felucca and just work on it for small wages. I was alone and the trip lasted 23 hours.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>I just finished reading &#8220;The Meaning of Life&#8221; by Edward O Wilson, a must-read for everyone. Very scientifically based, he examines all aspects. I especially liked his chapter on life on other planets. The human brain is the greatest evolutionary achievement ever and took 100 million years to get here, a series of chance mutations and luck. We separated from our ape ancestors about 6 million years ago and the human brain more than doubled in size from 600 ml to 1400 ml by about 300,000 years ago due to social pressures on a changing genetic base.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>Another civilization could have occurred somewhere in the last 100 million years but the chance of someone with human intelligence was remote and at least 10 light years away.

The modern city has expanded and includes the island of\u00a0Elephantine.<br \/>\nThe stone quarries located here were celebrated especially for the granitic rock called Syenite. They furnished the colossal statues, obelisks, and monolith shrines that are found throughout Egypt, including the pyramids. It was equally important as a military station and in every dynasty, it was a garrison town; and here tolls and customs were levied on all boats passing southwards and northwards.<br \/>\nThe Nile is nearly 650 m wide above Aswan. To the delta, the river flows for more than 1,200 km (750 mi) without bar or cataract. The voyage from Aswan to Alexandria usually took 21 to 28 days in favourable weather.<br \/>\nAswan has a hot desert climate like the rest of Egypt. Aswan and Luxor have the hottest summer days of any city in Egypt. Aswan is one of the hottest, sunniest and driest cities in the world.

These\u00a0rapids and the surrounding area have been variously flooded since the initial construction of the Aswan Low Dam in 1902. The temple complex was dismantled and moved to nearby Agilkia Island\u00a0as part of the\u00a0UNESCO Nubia Campaign project, protecting this and other complexes before the 1970 completion of the Aswan High Dam.<br \/>\nSince Philae was said to be one of the burying places of Osiris, it was held in high reverence both by the Egyptians to the north and the Nubians (often referred to as &#8220;Ethiopians&#8221; in Greek) to the south.<br \/>\nPhilae was also the centre of commerce between Mero\u00eb\u00a0and\u00a0Memphis. For the rapids of the cataracts were at most seasons impracticable, and the commodities exchanged between Egypt and Nubia were reciprocally landed and re-embarked at Syene and Philae.<br \/>\n<em>Buildings:<\/em> The most ancient was a temple for Isis, built in the reign of\u00a0Nectanebo I during 380-362 BC, the founding pharaoh of the\u00a0Thirtieth\u00a0and last native dynasty when he deposed and killed\u00a0Nepherites II.<br \/>\nFor the most part, the other ruins date from the Ptolemaic Kingdom with many traces of\u00a0Roman\u00a0work in Philae dedicated to\u00a0Ammon-Osiris.<br \/>\nBeyond the entrance into the principal court are small temples, one of which, dedicated to Isis, Hathor, and a wide range of deities related to\u00a0midwifery, is covered with sculptures representing the birth of Ptolemy Philometor, under the figure of the god\u00a0Horus. The story of\u00a0Osiris is everywhere represented on the walls of this temple, and two of its inner chambers are particularly rich in symbolic imagery.<br \/>\nGreat pains have been taken to mutilate the sculptures of this temple. The work of demolition is attributable, in the first instance, to the zeal of the early Christians, and afterward, to the policy of the\u00a0Iconoclasts, who curried favour for themselves with the\u00a0Byzantine court\u00a0by the destruction of\u00a0heathen\u00a0images as well as Christian ones. It&#8217;s notable that images\/icons of Horus are often less mutilated than the other carvings. In some wall scenes, every figure and hieroglyphic text<br \/>\nAt the southern extremity of the dromos of the Great Temple was a smaller temple, apparently dedicated to Hathor; Several Roman emperors made artistic and architectural contributions. During the Roman era, Philae was the site of the last known inscription in Egyptian hieroglyphs, written in AD 394, and the last known Demotic inscription, written in 452. Many Coptic crosses and graffiti were originating from the mid-1800s.<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-monasticism_25-0\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>Christianity built multiple churches on the island functioning alongside the pagan temples. Philae retained significance as a Christian center even after its closure as a pagan site. Five of its temples were converted into churches (including the Temple of Isis, which was dedicated to Saint Stephen), and two purpose-built churches were constructed on the north side of the island.<br \/>\nBy the 1960s the island was submerged up to a third of the buildings all year round. A large coffer dam was built, constructed of two rows of steel plates between which a 1 million cubic metres (35 million cubic feet) of sand was tipped. Any water that seeped through was pumped away. Next, the monuments were cleaned and measured, Then every building was dismantled into about 40,000 units from 2 to 25 tons, and then transported to the nearby Island of Agilkia, situated on higher ground some 500 metres (1,600 ft) away. The transfer itself took place between 1977 and 1980.<br \/>\n<em>Today, I travelled with a young woman from Seattle. We took a shared van most of the way and then walked about a kilometre crossing the Aswan Low Dam and a village to the boat pier. The boatmen keep the passengers to as few as possible and as most were privately booked by tour companies, we finally found the smallest boat who charged only 200 EP for the trip to Philae and back.

After a lot of big trucks coming from Aswan on their way to Cairo, we virtually didn&#8217;t see a car. Fortunately, Regeb likes to drive fast and we averaged over 120km\/hr. The road was excellent except for a few areas of broken pavement.<br \/>\nThe hotel was great as the cook was up at 04:30 to make a packed breakfast.<br \/>\nWe stopped at a bus stop (even though there were no buses!) in the middle of nowhere to have breakfast.<br \/>\nThe road crosses three railway lines, all abandoned. We then waited for an hour at the major highway intersection south of Kharga for a police escort with 3 cops in the car. I think they have nothing else to do and I was an excuse to get out of their remote, fly-infested police station. They drove at high speed, up to 140km\/hr, so having an escort is more dangerous than not. We reached Kharga at 10 am making it 5 hours. In Kharga, we had the same car plus a policeman inside the car to go to the sites.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<strong>Kharga Oasis and the Small Southern Oases. <\/strong>Tentative WHS (03\/09\/2015). The Kharga Oasis depression acted as a crossroad for long-running caravan routes. Its distinctive geological features represent the natural habitat of a variety of desert flora and fauna, distinctive geological and environmental features and antiquities: Palaeolithic and Neolithic distribution reflects the environmental changes that occurred around 10-12,000 years BP: Palaeolithic sites were located at the edges of the oasis, around a large lake that covered most of the depression. When the lake started to shrink, the population moved down with a significantly different environment: petroglyphs of various periods illustrate giraffes (running free and held with ropes), ostriches, crocodiles and gazelles.<br \/>\nPharaonic period agricultural, wine that Kharga is known to have exported in that period. The Persian Period: the earliest core of the Hibis Temple, later enlarged by the Ptolemies and the Romans. Persians introduced the water system consisting of subterranean aqueducts It was on the \u2018Oasis Route\u2019 used to bypass a problematic portion of the Nile Valley &#8211; a network of desert tracks including the small southern Oases of Nabta Playa, Kurkur and Dungul,<br \/>\nLate Roman Period (3<sup>rd<\/sup>\u00a0to 5<sup>th<\/sup>\u00a0century AD). The majority of the archaeological remains currently visible date to this period &#8211; an articulated chain of forts and fortified settlements, endowed with large-scale agricultural systems, subterranean aqueducts and cultivations extending for several kilometres.<br \/>\nIn the north, the large legionary fortress at al-Deir and its extensive cemeteries, the checkpoint of Qasr al-Gib and its small twin Qasr al-Sumayra, that represented the first\/last water station for incoming and outgoing travellers; Mohammed Tuleib, that swallowed the local Late Period Temple; and the two sturdy forts at Ain al-Lebekha and Umm al-Dabadib. Rectangular pigeon towers common with the best example at Ain al-Dabashiya.<br \/>\nIn the centre, gridded settlements were built around central buildings at Qasr al-Nessim (about to be swallowed by palm trees) and Qasr al-Baramoudy (a spectacular flower-shaped pigeon tower).<br \/>\nIn the south, the older fortified magazines of Dush linked to the Nile Valley.<br \/>\nEmperor Diocletian, as the southern limes of the Roman Empire, built an impressive chain of fortified settlements along the Kharga crossroad, consisting of elaborate settlements and sturdy buildings with a strong military flavour. Although all the Western Desert oases yielded evidence of having flourished at the very beginning of the fourth century, none sports the presence of a similar chain of fortified settlements, thus suggesting that the function of <em>this<\/em>\u00a0oasis as major desert crossroad was taken very seriously &#8211; controlling the caravan routes meant controlling regional trade and potential invaders, as well as marking the southern boundary of the empire and stating the influence of the Roman empire on the vast expanse of the Western Desert and territories further south.<br \/>\nChristian activities (4<sup>th<\/sup>\u00a0to 5<sup>th<\/sup> century). The large 5th-century\u00a0AD cemetery of Bagawat, the slopes of Gebel al-Teir behind the monastery of Mustapha Kashef are covered by thoroughly documented Coptic graffiti.<br \/>\nOttoman Period. Until the 19<sup>th<\/sup>\u00a0century, it functioned as a major trade route for import and export between Egypt and the Sultanate of Darfur, and further into the heart of Africa.<br \/>\nIn spite of almost rainlessness, these two Oases are rich in biodiversity. Palm groves and extensive\u00a0<em>Acacia<\/em>\u00a0groves. Kharga Oasis are the very last refuges of viable populations of the highly threatened dorcas gazelle\u00a0<em>Gazella dorcas<\/em>, and maybe also the highly vulnerable and extremely rare Sand Cat\u00a0<em>Felis margarita<\/em>, thought to be the ancestor of the domestic cat.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nEl Bagawat<\/strong> is an ancient Christian cemetery, one of the oldest in the world, which functioned at the Kharga Oasis in southern-central Egypt from the 3rd to the 7th century AD. Early Christians supported the Fifth Century Bishop Nestorius who fled Roman persecution to settle in the Western Desert in Bagawat (The Romans ruled in Egypt from 30 BCE to 640 CE). It is one of the earliest and best-preserved Christian cemeteries from the ancient world. Kharga is one of the largest oases in Egypt and is 34 m below sea level.<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStoppato2003135_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>The El Bagawat cemetery is reported to be pre-historic. Before Christianity was introduced into Egypt, it was a burial ground used by the non-Christians and later by the Christians.

The Chapel of the Exodus (first half of the 4th century) is one of the smallest, a tiny square tomb. The pictures are very rustic and have a depiction of the martyrdom of Isiah, Tekla postured with raised hands, in front of a fire being doused by rain, and a building with 7 steps (there are at least three) that may represent Jerusalem. The Chapel of Peace (5th or 6th century) has the illustrative fresco of Thekla and Paul and a central well.\u00a0 These are the best preserved frescoes but fresco fragments can also be seen in Chapels.25, 172, 173, 175, and 210 (none but the above two are signed and there are no numbers so I&#8217;m not sure how these others could be found). One that is unmarked has the best preserved with 4 doves.<br \/>\nThe largest building is a 3-nave church with no roof.

If you look at the rock formations in this area you\u2019ll see that they are also largely made of crystal. The most famous of the formations is the\u00a0<strong>Crystal Mountain<\/strong>, actually a large rock made entirely of quartz. It sits right beside the main road some 24km north of Naqb As Sillim and is easily recognizable by the large hole through its middle.<br \/>\nAt the time of writing, foreigners were officially no longer allowed to camp overnight in the desert, but in reality, many people do. The tourist police turn a blind eye, but it pays to do the trip with an experienced safari outfit. As well as the national park entry fee, you pay a LE20 fee for each night you sleep here. If you come as part of a group, the fees are included in your tour. You can usually buy tickets at the entrance to the park, but don\u2019t worry about going in without one; you can just pay the rangers when they find you. Sleeping anywhere in the park, surrounded by the white formations and visited by friendly fennecs, is an unforgettable experience.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"Image__image\" src=\"https:\/\/dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com\/cnn\/q_auto,w_634,c_fill,g_auto,h_357,ar_16:9\/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F200317140716-04-egypt-white-desert-restricted.jpg\" alt=\"The White Desert is an otherworldly landscape in Egypt.\" width=\"618\" height=\"348\" \/><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"Image__image\" src=\"https:\/\/dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com\/cnn\/q_auto,w_634,c_fill,g_auto,h_357,ar_16:9\/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F200317140652-03-egypt-white-desert.jpg\" alt=\"The desert is believed to have once been the site of an ocean or sea.\" width=\"618\" height=\"348\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Cave of Swimmers.\u00a0<\/strong>A\u00a0cave\u00a0with ancient\u00a0rock art\u00a0in the mountainous\u00a0Gilf Kebir\u00a0plateau\u00a0of the\u00a0Libyan Desert\u00a0section of the\u00a0Sahara.

The shelter is upwardly topped off by\u00a0rock engravings.<br \/>\nIn 2016 a report concluded that the 13 small stencil hands were more likely made by humans using the hand of a\u00a0monitor lizard\u00a0as a stencil.<br \/>\nMany of the beasts were intentionally disfigured in prehistoric times. Always surrounded by human creatures, the beasts catch the eye due to their body size and shape: Long-tailed, bull-like body, frequently three-footed with human-like legs. Even headless they appear either to spit or to swallow human creatures.<br \/>\nThe shelter is covered with groups of dancing, floating or swimming human creatures. On the lower left edge of the shelter appear two groups of human creatures separated from each other by a rock crack. The ones above the rock crack are holding a sling over his head, while the ones below the crack have a hand above their heads and are all looking to the left.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"_2_tDEnGMLxpM6uOa2kaDB3 ImageBox-image media-element _1XWObl-3b9tPy64oaG6fax\" src=\"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/abmj759bf1t31.jpg\" alt=\"r\/DeathStranding - Cave of beasts, Egypt.

Along with the beasts, the figures of the shelter represent a mythological world whose symbolism has not been deciphered yet.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>NILE VALLEY &#8211; MIDDLE EGYPT\u00a0(Luxor, Aswan, Sohag, Asyut, Qena) Observations 1.
