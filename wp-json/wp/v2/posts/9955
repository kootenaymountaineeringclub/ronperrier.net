This period of Nordic military, mercantile and demographic expansion constitutes an important element in the early medieval\u00a0history of Scandinavia,\u00a0Estonia, the\u00a0British Isles,\u00a0France,\u00a0Kievan Rus&#8217;\u00a0and\u00a0Sicily.<br \/>\nFacilitated by advanced sailing and navigational skills, and characterized by the longship, Viking activities at times also extended into the Mediterranean, North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia (often as the Normans). Following extended phases of (primarily sea- or river-borne) exploration, expansion and settlement, Viking (Norse) communities and polities were established in diverse areas of north-western Europe, Belarus, Ukraine and European Russia, the North Atlantic islands and as far as the north-eastern coast of North America. This period of expansion witnessed the wider dissemination of Norse culture, while simultaneously introducing strong foreign cultural influences into Scandinavia itself, with profound developmental implications in both directions.<br \/>\nPopular, modern conceptions of the Vikings\u2014the term frequently applied casually to their modern descendants and the inhabitants of modern Scandinavia\u2014often strongly differ from the complex picture that emerges from archaeology and historical sources. A romanticized picture of Vikings as noble savages began to emerge in the 18th century; this developed and became widely propagated during the 19th-century Viking revival. Perceived views of the Vikings as alternatively violent, piratical heathens or intrepid adventurers owe much to conflicting varieties of the modern Viking myth that had taken shape by the early 20th century. Current popular representations of the Vikings are typically based on cultural clich\u00e9s and stereotypes, complicating modern appreciation of the Viking legacy. These representations are not always accurate \u2013 for example, there is no evidence that they wore horned helmets.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ETYMOLOGY<br \/>\n<\/strong>The most likely etymology derives Viking from the same root as Old Norse vika, &#8216;sea mile&#8217;, originally &#8216;the distance between two shifts of rowers&#8217;, &#8216;to move, to turn&#8217;, with nautical usages. The term most likely predates the use of the sail by the Germanic peoples of North-Western Europe. The idea behind it is that the tired rower moves aside for the rested rower on the thwart when he relieves him. The Old Norse v\u00edking may originally have been a sea journey characterized by the shifting of rowers, i.e. a long-distance sea journey because in the pre-sail era, the shifting of rowers would distinguish long-distance sea journeys. A v\u00edking was originally a participant on a sea journey characterized by the shifting of rowers. The word Viking was not originally connected to Scandinavian seafarers but assumed this meaning when the Scandinavians began to dominate the seas.<br \/>\nThe word Viking was introduced into Modern English during the 18th-century Viking revival, at which point it acquired romanticized heroic overtones of &#8220;barbarian warrior&#8221; or noble savage. During the 20th century, the meaning of the term was expanded to refer to not only seaborne raiders from Scandinavia and other places settled by them (like Iceland and the Faroe Islands), but also any member of the culture that produced said raiders from about 700 to as late as about 1100. As an adjective, the word is used to refer to ideas, phenomena, or artifacts connected with those people and their cultural life, producing expressions like Viking age, Viking culture, Viking art, Viking religion, Viking ship and so on.<br \/>\nSome archaeologists and historians of today believe that these Scandinavian settlements in the Slavic lands played a significant role in the formation of the\u00a0Kievan Rus&#8217;federation, and hence the names and early states of Russia and Belarus.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HISTORY<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Viking Age<\/strong>. The period from the earliest recorded raids in the 790s until the\u00a0Norman conquest of England\u00a0in 1066 is commonly known as the Viking Age of Scandinavian history.\u00a0Vikings used the\u00a0Norwegian Sea\u00a0and\u00a0Baltic Sea\u00a0for sea routes to the south.<br \/>\nThe Normans were descended from Vikings who were given feudal overlordship of areas in northern France\u2014the Duchy of Normandy\u2014in the 10th century. In that respect, descendants of the Vikings continued to influence northern Europe.<br \/>\nLikewise, King\u00a0Harold Godwinson, the last Anglo-Saxon king of England, had Danish ancestors. Two Vikings even ascended to the throne of England, with\u00a0Sweyn Forkbeard claiming the English throne in 1013\u20131014 and his son\u00a0Cnut the Great\u00a0becoming king of England 1016\u20131035.<br \/>\nGeographically, a Viking Age may be assigned to not only Scandinavian lands (modern Denmark, Norway and Sweden), but also territories under\u00a0North Germanic\u00a0dominance, mainly the\u00a0Danelaw, including\u00a0Scandinavian York, the administrative centre of the remains of the Kingdom of\u00a0Northumbria,\u00a0parts of\u00a0Mercia, and\u00a0East Anglia in England. Viking navigators opened the road to new lands to the north, west and east, resulting in the foundation of independent settlements in the\u00a0Shetland,\u00a0Orkney, and\u00a0Faroe Islands, Iceland, Greenland, and L\u2019Anse aux Meadows, a short-lived settlement in\u00a0Newfoundland, circa 1000. The Greenland settlement was established around 980, during the\u00a0Medieval Warm Period, and its demise by the mid-15th century may have been partly due to\u00a0climate change.<br \/>\nThe Viking\u00a0Rurik dynasty\u00a0took control of territories in\u00a0Slavic\u00a0and\u00a0Finno-Ugric-dominated areas of Eastern Europe; they annexed\u00a0Kiev\u00a0in 882 to serve as the capital of the\u00a0Kievan Rus&#8217;.<br \/>\nAs early as 839, when Swedish emissaries were first known to have visited Byzantium, Scandinavians served as mercenaries in the service of the Byzantine Empire. In the late 10th century, a new unit of the imperial bodyguard was formed. Traditionally containing large numbers of Scandinavians, it was known as the Varangian Guard. The word Varangian may have originated in Old Norse, but in Slavic and Greek, it could refer either to Scandinavians or Franks. The most eminent Scandinavian to serve in the Varangian Guard was Harald Hardrada, who subsequently established himself as king of Norway (1047\u20131066).<br \/>\nThere is archaeological evidence that Vikings reached\u00a0Baghdad, the centre of the\u00a0Islamic Empire.<br \/>\nThe Norse regularly plied the\u00a0Volga\u00a0with their trade goods: furs, tusks, seal fat for boat sealant, and\u00a0slaves. Important trading ports during the period include\u00a0Birka,\u00a0Hedeby,\u00a0Kaupang,\u00a0Jorvik,\u00a0Staraya Ladoga,\u00a0Novgorod, and\u00a0Kiev.<br \/>\nGenerally speaking, the Norwegians expanded to the north and west to places such as Ireland, Scotland, Iceland, and Greenland; the Danes to England and France, settling in the Danelaw (northern\/eastern England) and Normandy; and the Swedes to the east, founding Kievan Rus&#8217;. Among the Swedish rune stones mentioning expeditions overseas, almost half tell of raids and travels to Western Europe. According to the Icelandic sagas, many Norwegian Vikings also went to eastern Europe.<br \/>\nIn the Viking Age, the present-day nations of Norway, Sweden and Denmark did not exist, but were largely homogeneous and similar in culture and language, although somewhat distinct geographically. The names of Scandinavian kings are reliably known only for the later part of the Viking Age. After the end of the Viking Age, the separate kingdoms gradually acquired distinct identities as nations, which went hand-in-hand with their Christianization. Thus the end of the Viking Age for the Scandinavians also marks the start of their relatively brief Middle Ages.<br \/>\n<strong>Expansion.<\/strong> The colonization of Iceland by Norwegian Vikings began in the ninth century. The first source that Iceland and Greenland appear in is a papal letter of 1053. Twenty years later, they are then seen in the Gesta of Adam of Bremen. It was not until after 1130 when the islands had become Christianized, that accounts of the history of the islands were written from the point of view of the inhabitants in sagas and chronicles. The Vikings explored the northern islands and coasts of the North Atlantic, and ventured south to North Africa and east to Russia, Constantinople, and the Middle East. They raided and pillaged, traded, acted as mercenaries and settled wide-ranging colonies. Early Vikings probably returned home after their raids. Later in their history, they began to settle in other lands.<br \/>\nVikings under\u00a0Leif Ericson, heir to\u00a0Erik the Red, reached North America and set up short-lived settlements in present-day\u00a0L&#8217;Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland, Canada. This expansion occurred during the\u00a0Medieval Warm Period.<br \/>\nViking expansion into continental Europe was limited. Their realm was bordered by powerful cultures to the south. Early on, it was the Saxons, who occupied Old Saxony, located in what is now Northern Germany. The Saxons were a fierce and powerful people and were often in conflict with the Vikings. To counter the Saxon aggression and solidify their presence, the Danes constructed the huge defence fortification of Danevirke in and around Hedeby near Jelling in Denmark. The Vikings soon witnessed the violent subduing of the Saxons by Charlemagne, in the thirty-year Saxon Wars in 772\u2013804. The Saxon defeat resulted in their forced christening and the absorption of Old Saxony into the Carolingian Empire. Fear of the Franks led the Vikings to further expand Danevirke, and the defence constructions remained in use throughout the Viking Age and even up until 1864.<br \/>\nThe south coast of the Baltic Sea was ruled by the Obotrites, a federation of Slavic tribes loyal to the Carolingians and later the Frankish Empire. The Vikings\u2014led by King Gudfred\u2014destroyed the Obotrite city of Reric on the southern Baltic coast in 808 AD and transferred the merchants and traders to Hedeby. This secured their supremacy in the Baltic Sea, which remained throughout the Viking Age.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Motives<\/strong>. The motives driving the Viking expansion are a topic of much debate in Nordic history. One common theory posits that Charlemagne &#8220;used force and terror to Christianize all pagans&#8221;, leading to baptism, conversion or execution, and as a result, Vikings and other pagans resisted and wanted revenge. It is not a coincidence that the early Viking activity occurred during the reign of Charlemagne. The penetration of Christianity into Scandinavia led to serious conflict dividing Norway for almost a century.<br \/>\nAnother explanation is that the Vikings exploited a moment of weakness in the surrounding regions. England suffered from internal divisions and was relatively easy prey given the proximity of many towns to the sea or navigable rivers. The lack of organized naval opposition throughout Western Europe allowed Viking ships to travel freely, raiding or trading as opportunity permitted.<br \/>\nThe decline in the profitability of old trade routes could also have played a role. Trade between Western Europe and the rest of Eurasia suffered a severe blow when the Roman Empire fell in the 5th century. The expansion of Islam in the 7th century also affected trade with Western Europe.<br \/>\nRaids in Europe, including raids and settlements from Scandinavia, were not unprecedented and had occurred long before the Vikings arrived. The Jutes invaded the British Isles three centuries earlier, pouring out from Jutland during the Age of Migrations before the Danes settled there. The Saxons and the Angles did the same, embarking from mainland Europe. The Viking raids were, however, the first to be documented in writing by eyewitnesses, and they were much larger in scale and frequency than in previous times.<br \/>\nVikings themselves were expanding; although their motives are unclear, historians believe that scarce resources were a factor.<br \/>\nThe &#8220;Highway of Slaves&#8221; was a term used to describe a route that the Vikings found to have a direct pathway from Scandinavia to Constantinople and Baghdad while travelling on the Baltic Sea. With the advancements of their ships during the ninth century, the Vikings were able to sail to Russia and some northern parts of Europe.<br \/>\nJomsborg\u00a0or\u00a0J\u00f3msborg\u00a0was a semi-legendary\u00a0Viking\u00a0stronghold at the southern coast of the\u00a0Baltic Sea\u00a0(medieval\u00a0Wendland, modern\u00a0Pomerania), that existed between the 960s and 1043. Its inhabitants were known as\u00a0Jomsvikings. Jomsborg&#8217;s exact location, or its existence, has not yet been established, though it is often maintained that Jomsborg was somewhere on the islands of the\u00a0Oder\u00a0estuary.<\/p>\n<p><strong>End of the Viking Age<br \/>\n<\/strong>During the Viking Age, Scandinavian men and women travelled to many parts of Europe and beyond, in a cultural diaspora that left its traces from Newfoundland to\u00a0Byzantium. This period of energetic activity also had a pronounced effect in the Scandinavian homelands, with profound cultural changes.<br \/>\nBy the late 11th century, royal dynasties legitimized by the Catholic Church (which had had little influence in Scandinavia 300 years earlier) were asserting their power with increasing authority and ambition, and the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden had taken shape. Towns functioned as secular and ecclesiastical administrative centres and market sites, and monetary economies began to emerge based on English and German models. By this time the influx of Islamic silver from the East had been absent for more than a century, and the flow of English silver had come to an end in the mid-11th century.<br \/>\nChristianity had taken root\u00a0in Denmark and Norway with the establishment of dioceses during the 11th century, and the new religion was beginning to organize and assert itself more effectively in Sweden. Foreign churchmen and native elites were energetic in furthering the interests of Christianity, which was now no longer operating only on a missionary footing, and old ideologies and lifestyles were transforming. By 1103, the first archbishopric was founded in Scandinavia, at\u00a0Lund, Scania, then part of Denmark.<br \/>\nThe assimilation of the nascent Scandinavian kingdoms into the cultural mainstream of European Christendom altered the aspirations of Scandinavian rulers and of Scandinavians able to travel overseas and changed their relations with their neighbours. One of the primary sources of profit for the Vikings had been slave-taking. The medieval Church held that Christians should not own fellow Christians as slaves, so chattel slavery diminished as a practice throughout northern Europe. This took much of the economic incentive out of raiding, though sporadic slaving activity continued into the 11th century. Scandinavian predation in Christian lands around the North and Irish Seas diminished markedly.<br \/>\nThe kings of Norway continued to assert power in parts of northern Britain and Ireland, and raids continued into the 12th century, but the military ambitions of Scandinavian rulers were now directed toward new paths. In 1107,\u00a0Sigurd I of Norway\u00a0sailed for the eastern Mediterranean with Norwegian crusaders to fight for the newly established\u00a0Kingdom of Jerusalem, and Danes and Swedes participated energetically in the\u00a0Baltic Crusades\u00a0of the 12th and 13th centuries.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CULTURE <\/strong><br \/>\nAlthough they were generally a non-literate culture that produced no literary legacy, they had an alphabet and described themselves and their world on\u00a0rune stones. Most contemporary literary and written sources on the Vikings come from other cultures that were in contact with them.\u00a0Since the mid-20th century, archaeological findings have built a more complete and balanced picture of the lives of the Vikings.<br \/>\nThe archaeological record is particularly rich and varied, providing knowledge of their rural and urban settlement, crafts and production, ships and military equipment, trading networks, as well as their pagan and Christian religious artifacts and practices.<br \/>\n<strong>Literature and Language<br \/>\n<\/strong>The most important\u00a0primary sources\u00a0on the Vikings are contemporary texts from Scandinavia and regions where the Vikings were active.\u00a0Writing in\u00a0Latin\u00a0letters was introduced to Scandinavia with Christianity, so there are few native documentary sources from Scandinavia before the late 11th and early 12th centuries.\u00a0The Scandinavians did write inscriptions in\u00a0runes, but these are usually very short and formulaic. Most contemporary documentary sources consist of texts written in Christian and Islamic communities outside Scandinavia, often by authors who had been negatively affected by Viking activity.<br \/>\nLater writings on the Vikings and the Viking Age can also be important for understanding them and their culture, although they need to be treated cautiously. After the consolidation of the church and the assimilation of Scandinavia and its colonies into the mainstream of medieval Christian culture in the 11th and 12th centuries, native written sources begin to appear, in Latin and Old Norse. In the Viking colony of Iceland, extraordinary vernacular literature blossomed in the 12th through 14th centuries, and many traditions connected with the Viking Age were written down for the first time in the Icelandic sagas. A literal interpretation of these medieval prose narratives about the Vikings and the Scandinavian past is doubtful, but many specific elements remain &#8211; skaldic poetry attributed to court poets of the 10th and 11th centuries, the exposed family trees, the self-images, the ethical values, all included in these literary writings.<br \/>\nIndirectly, the Vikings have also left a window open to their language, culture and activities, through many Old Norse place names and words, found in their former sphere of influence. Some of these place names and words are still in direct use today, almost unchanged, and shed light on where they settled and what specific places meant to them, as seen in place names like Egilsay (from Eigils \u00d8 meaning Eigil&#8217;s Island), Ormskirk (from Ormr kirkja meaning Orms Church or Church of the Worm), Meols (from merl meaning Sand Dunes), Snaefell (Snow Fell), Ravenscar (Ravens Rock), Vinland (Land of Wine or Land of Winberry), Kaupanger (Market Harbour), T\u00f3rshavn (Thor&#8217;s Harbour), and the religious centre of Odense, meaning a place where Odin was worshipped. Viking influence is also evident in concepts like the present-day parliamentary body of the Tynwald on the Isle of Man.<br \/>\n<strong>Common Words<\/strong> in everyday English language, like some of the weekdays (Thursday means Thor&#8217;s day), axle, crook raft, knife, plough, leather, window, berserk, bylaw, thorp, skerry, husband, heathen, Hell, Norman and ransack stem from the Old Norse of the Vikings and allow us to understand their interactions with the people and cultures of the British Isles. In the Northern Isles of Shetland and Orkney, Old Norse completely replaced the local languages and over time evolved into the now-extinct Norn language. Some modern words and names only emerge and contribute to our understanding after a more intense research of linguistic sources from medieval or later records, such as York (Horse Bay), Swansea (Sveinn&#8217;s Isle) or some of the place names in Northern France like Tocqueville (Toki&#8217;s farm).<br \/>\nLinguistic\u00a0and\u00a0etymological\u00a0studies continue to provide a vital source of information on the Viking culture, their social structure and history and how they interacted with the people and cultures they met, traded, attacked or lived with in overseas settlements.<br \/>\nIt has been speculated that several place names on the west coast of southern France might also stem from Viking activities.\u00a0Place names like\u00a0Taillebourg\u00a0(Trelleborg, meaning City of\u00a0Thralls\u00a0or Castle of Thralls) exist as far south as the\u00a0Charente River.\u00a0Gascony\u00a0and vicinity\u00a0is an active area of Viking archaeology at present.<br \/>\nOld Norse did not exert any great influence on the Slavic languages in the Viking settlements of Eastern Europe, possibly because of the great differences between the two languages, combined with the Rus Viking&#8217;s more peaceful businesses in these areas and the fact that they were outnumbered.<br \/>\nA consequence of the available written sources, which may have coloured how the Viking Age is perceived as a historical period, is that much more is known of the Vikings&#8217; activities in Western Europe than in the East. One reason is that the cultures of north-eastern Europe at the time were non-literate, and did not produce a legacy of literature. Another is that the vast majority of written sources on Scandinavia in the Viking Age come from Iceland, a nation originally settled by Norwegian colonists. As a result, there is much more material from the Viking Age about Norway than Sweden, which apart from many runic inscriptions, has almost no written sources from the early Middle Ages.<br \/>\n<strong>Runestones<br \/>\n<\/strong>The Norse of the Viking Age could read and write and used a non-standardized alphabet, called\u00a0runor, built upon sound values and using 16 letters or signs. While there are few remains of runic writing on paper from the Viking era, thousands of stones with runic inscriptions have been found where Vikings lived. They are usually in memory of the dead, though not necessarily placed at graves. The use of\u00a0runor\u00a0survived into the 15th century, used in parallel with the Latin alphabet. Messages also included land deeds performed by dead people about the inheritance of property.<br \/>\nThe majority of runic inscriptions from the Viking period are found in Sweden and date from the 11th century. The oldest stone with runic inscriptions was found in Norway and dates to the 4th century, suggesting that runic inscriptions pre-date the Viking period. Many rune stones in Scandinavia record the names of participants in Viking expeditions, such as the\u00a0<strong>Kjula runestone<\/strong> which tells of extensive warfare in Western Europe and the\u00a0<strong>Turinge Runestone<\/strong>, which tells of a war band in Eastern Europe. Other runestones mention men who died on Viking expeditions. Among them are around 25\u00a0<strong>Ingvar runestones<\/strong>\u00a0in the\u00a0M\u00e4lardalen\u00a0district of Sweden, erected to commemorate members of a disastrous expedition into present-day Russia in the early 11th century.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0<strong>Jelling stones<\/strong>\u00a0date from between 960 and 985. The older, smaller stone was raised by King\u00a0Gorm the Old, the last pagan king of Denmark, as a memorial honouring\u00a0Queen Thyre.\u00a0The larger stone was raised by his son,\u00a0Harald Bluetooth, to celebrate the conquest of Denmark and Norway and the conversion of the Danes to Christianity. It has three sides: one with an animal image, one with an image of the crucified Jesus Christ, and a third bearing the following inscription:\u00a0<em>King Haraldr ordered this monument made in memory of Gorm, his father, and in memory of Thyrv\u00e9, his mother; that Haraldr who won for himself all of Denmark and Norway and made the Danes Christian<\/em>.<br \/>\nRune stones attest to voyages to locations such as Bath, Greece, Khwaresm, Jerusalem, Italy (as Langobardland), Serkland (i.e. the Muslim world), England (including London, and various places in Eastern Europe. Viking Age inscriptions have also been discovered on the\u00a0<strong>Manx runestones<\/strong>\u00a0on the Isle of Man.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BURIAL SITES<br \/>\n<\/strong>There are numerous burial sites associated with Vikings throughout Europe and their sphere of influence\u2014in Scandinavia, the British Isles, Ireland, Greenland, Iceland, Faeroe Islands, Germany, The Baltic, Russia, etc. The burial practices of the Vikings were quite varied, from dug graves in the ground to tumuli, sometimes including so-called ship burials.<br \/>\nAccording to written sources, most of the funerals took place at sea. The funerals involved either burial or cremation, depending on local customs. In the area that is now Sweden, cremations were predominant; in Denmark burial was more common; and in Norway both were common. Viking barrows are one of the primary sources of evidence for circumstances in the Viking Age. The items buried with the dead give some indication as to what was considered important to possess in the afterlife. It is unknown what mortuary services were given to dead children by the Vikings. Some of the burial sites that are most important for understanding the Vikings include:<br \/>\nNorway:\u00a0Oseberg;\u00a0Gokstad;\u00a0Borrehaugene.<br \/>\nSweden:\u00a0Gettlinge\u00a0gravf\u00e4lt; the cemeteries of\u00a0Birka, a World Heritage Site;\u00a0Valsg\u00e4rde;\u00a0Gamla Uppsala; Hulterstad gravf\u00e4lt, near\u00a0Alby; Hulterstad,\u00a0\u00d6land.<br \/>\nDenmark:\u00a0Jelling, a\u00a0World Heritage Site;\u00a0Lindholm H\u00f8je;\u00a0Ladby ship, Mammen chamber tomb and hoard.<br \/>\nEstonia:\u00a0Salme ships\u00a0\u2013 The largest ship burial ground ever uncovered.<br \/>\nScotland:\u00a0Port an Eilean Mh\u00f2ir ship burial;\u00a0Scar boat burial, Orkney.<br \/>\nFaroe Islands:\u00a0Hov.<br \/>\nIceland:\u00a0Mosfellsb\u00e6r\u00a0in\u00a0Capital Region; the boat burial in Vatnsdalur,\u00a0Austur-H\u00fanavatnss\u00fdsla.<br \/>\nGreenland:\u00a0Brattahl\u00ed\u00f0.<br \/>\nGermany:\u00a0Hedeby.<br \/>\nLatvia:\u00a0Grobi\u0146a.<br \/>\nUkraine: the\u00a0Black Grave.<br \/>\nRussia:\u00a0Gnezdovo.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SHIPS<br \/>\n<\/strong>There have been several archaeological finds of Viking ships of all sizes, providing knowledge of the craftsmanship that went into building them. There were many types of Viking ships, built for various uses; the best-known type is probably the\u00a0<strong>longship<\/strong>. Longships were intended for warfare and exploration, designed for speed and agility, and were equipped with oars to complement the sail, making navigation possible independently of the wind. Speeds of up to 10knots (18kms\/hour) were possible. The longship had a long, narrow hull and shallow draught to facilitate landings and troop deployments in shallow water. Longships were used extensively by the Leidang, the Scandinavian defence fleets. Under oar, they were very maneuverable and thus useful in war conditions. The largest held 70-80 men and was 37m long (the one at Roskilde was the longest known). The longship allowed the Norse to go Viking, which might explain why this type of ship has become almost synonymous with the concept of Vikings. The longship facilitated far-reaching expeditions, but the Vikings also constructed several other types of ships.<br \/>\nThe Vikings built many unique types of watercraft, often used for more peaceful tasks. The<strong> Knarr<\/strong> was a dedicated merchant vessel designed to carry cargo in bulk. It had a broader hull, deeper draught, and a small number of oars (used primarily to manoeuvre in harbours and similar situations). One Viking innovation was the &#8216;beasts&#8217;, a spar mounted to the sail that allowed their ships to sail effectively against the wind.\u00a0It was common for seafaring Viking ships to tow or carry a smaller boat to transfer crews and cargo from the ship to shore. Several people in one village would own and share a boat.<br \/>\nShips were an integral part of the Viking culture. They facilitated everyday transportation across seas and waterways, exploration of new lands, raids, conquests, and trade with neighbouring cultures. They also held a major religious importance. People with high status were sometimes buried in a ship along with animal sacrifices, weapons, provisions and other items, as evidenced by the buried vessels at\u00a0Gokstad\u00a0and\u00a0Oseberg\u00a0in Norway\u00a0and the excavated ship burial at\u00a0Ladby\u00a0in Denmark. Ship burials were also practiced by Vikings abroad, as evidenced by the excavations of the\u00a0Salme ships\u00a0on the Estonian island of\u00a0Saaremaa.<br \/>\nWell-preserved remains of five Viking ships were excavated from Roskilde Fjord in the late 1960s, representing both the longship and the Knarr. The ships were scuttled there in the 11th century to block a navigation channel and thus protect Roskilde, then the Danish capital, from seaborne assault. The remains of these ships are on display at the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nTAR and VIKING SHIPS<\/strong>\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Nov 1st 2018 Economist<\/span><br \/>\n<\/span><span data-caps=\"initial\">A<\/span><small>ccording to the<\/small>\u00a0Saga of Erik the Red, \u201cshipworm will not bore into the wood which has been smeared with the seal-tar\u201d. Viking scholars debate the precise meaning of \u201cseal\u201d in \u201cseal-tar\u201d. One interpretation is that the Scandinavian conquerors mixed tar, or pitch, with animal fat and some experiments suggest this may indeed keep shipworm at bay. What is clear is that tar was an important marine technology, and new finds suggest that a vast industry making it emerged at the beginning of the Viking era, helping enable their conquests.<br \/>\nThe oldest tar pits in Sweden date from around 100<small>ad<\/small>\u00a0to 400<small>ad<\/small>. The first were discovered in the early 2000s, and are found close to old settlements, suggesting that the tar was for coating houses and household items. It was made by stacking pine wood into conical pits a metre or two across, setting the wood on fire and covering it with turf and charcoal to encourage slow combustion. In this way, the wood\u2019s resin would turn to tar and drip out of the cone\u2019s bottom into a buried container.<br \/>\nHowever, as Andreas Hennius, an archaeologist at Uppsala University, reports in this month\u2019s\u00a0<em class=\"Italic\">Antiquity<\/em>, around the eighth century something shifted. The pits got much bigger\u2014reaching eight to ten metres in diameter\u2014and moved far into the forest. These pits could have made between 200 and 300 litres of tar in a single production cycle.<br \/>\nMr Hennius argues that the builders needed all this tar for ships. The eighth century was when sails arrived in Scandinavia. That, in his view, is no coincidence. Tar has been found on hulls, rigging and small fragments of sails from Viking vessels. It was used to waterproof the hulls and windproof the sails. It was also, according to Morten Ravn of the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde, Denmark, mixed with pigments such as ochre to give sails colour and offer protection from damaging ultraviolet rays.<br \/>\nSailing suddenly expanded people\u2019s maritime reach, creating opportunities both for long-distance trade and for the large, swift attacks that defined the Viking Age. Vikings conquered half of England and part of northern France. They raided as far as the Mediterranean and left monks in coastal monasteries quaking in their cassocks. \u201cFrom the fury of the Northmen, O Lord, deliver us!\u201d these monks prayed. From their tar pits, too.<\/p>\n<p><strong>EVERYDAY LIFE<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Social structure.<\/strong> The Viking society was divided into three socio-economic classes: Thralls, Karls and Jarls. This is described vividly in the Eddic poem of R\u00edgs\u00feula, which also explains that it was the God R\u00edg \u2013 father of mankind also known as Heimdallr \u2013 who created the three classes. Archaeology has confirmed this social structure.<br \/>\n<strong>Thralls<\/strong> were the lowest-ranking class and were slaves. Slaves comprised as much as a quarter of the population. Slavery was of vital importance to Viking society, for everyday chores and large-scale construction and also to trade and the economy. Thralls were servants and workers in the farms and larger households of the Karls and Jarls, and they were used for constructing fortifications, ramps, canals, mounds, roads and similar hard work projects. According to the Rigsthula, Thralls were despised and looked down upon. New thralls were supplied by either the sons and daughters of thralls or they were captured abroad. The Vikings often deliberately captured many people on their raids in Europe, to enslave them as thralls. The thralls were then brought back home to Scandinavia by boat, used on location or in newer settlements to build needed structures, or sold, often to the Arabs in exchange for silver. Other names for thrall were &#8216;tr\u00e6l&#8217; and &#8216;ty&#8217;.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nKarls<\/strong> were free peasants. They owned farms, land and cattle and engaged in daily chores like ploughing the fields, milking the cattle, building houses and wagons, but used thralls to make ends meet. Other names for Karls were &#8216;bonde&#8217; or simply free men.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Jarls<\/strong> were the aristocracy of the Viking society. They were wealthy and owned large estates with huge longhouses, horses and many thralls. The thralls did most of the daily chores, while the Jarls did administration, politics, hunting, and sports, visited other Jarls or were abroad on expeditions. When a Jarl died and was buried, his household thralls were sometimes sacrificially killed and buried next to him, as many excavations have revealed.<br \/>\nIn daily life, there were many intermediate positions in the overall social structure and it is believed that there must have been some social mobility. These details are unclear, but titles and positions like\u00a0hauldr,\u00a0thegn,\u00a0landmand, show mobility between the Karls and the Jarls.<br \/>\nOther social structures included the communities of f\u00e9lag in both the civil and the military spheres, to which its members (called f\u00e9lagi) were obliged. A f\u00e9lag could be centred around certain trades, common ownership of a sea vessel or a military obligation under a specific leader. Members of the latter were referred to as drenge, one of the words for a warrior. There were also official communities within towns and villages, the overall defence, religion, the legal system and the Things.<br \/>\n<strong>Women<\/strong> had a relatively free status in the Nordic countries of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, illustrated in the Icelandic Gr\u00e1g\u00e1s and the Norwegian Frostating laws and Gulating laws. The paternal aunt, paternal niece and paternal granddaughter referred to as odalkvinna, all had the right to inherit property from a deceased man. In the absence of male relatives, an unmarried woman with no son could inherit not only property but also the position of head of the family from a deceased father or brother. Such a woman was referred to as Baugrygr, and she exercised all the rights afforded to the head of a family clan \u2013 such as the right to demand and receive fines for the slaughter of a family member \u2013 until she married, by which her rights were transferred to her new husband. After the age of 20, an unmarried woman, referred to as maer and mey, reached the legal majority and had the right to decide her place of residence and was regarded as her person before the law. An exception to her independence was the right to choose a marriage partner, as marriages were normally arranged by the family. They had the right to divorce.<br \/>\n<strong>Widows<\/strong> enjoyed the same independent status as unmarried women. A married woman could divorce her husband and remarry. It was also socially acceptable for a free woman to cohabit with a man and have children with him without marrying him, even if that man was married; a woman in such a position was called frilla. There was no distinction made between children born inside or outside marriage: both had the right to inherit property after their parents, and there were no &#8220;legitimate&#8221; or &#8220;illegitimate&#8221; children.<br \/>\nWomen had religious authority and were active as priestesses (gydja) and oracles (sejdkvinna). They were active within art as poets (skalder) and rune masters and as merchants and medicine women. They may also have been active within military office: the stories about shield maidens is unconfirmed, but some archaeological finds such as the Birka female Viking warrior may indicate that at least some women in military authority existed. These liberties gradually disappeared after the introduction of Christianity, and from the late 13th century, they are no longer mentioned.<\/p>\n<p><strong>APPEARANCES<br \/>\n<\/strong>The three classes were easily recognizable by their appearances. Men and women of the Jarls were well groomed with neat hairstyles and expressed their wealth and status by wearing expensive clothes (often silk) and well-crafted jewelry like brooches, belt buckles, necklaces and arm rings. Almost all of the jewelry was crafted in specific designs unique to the Norse (see Viking art). Finger rings were seldom used and earrings were not used at all, as they were seen as a Slavic phenomenon. Most Karls expressed similar tastes and hygiene but in a more relaxed and inexpensive way.<\/p>\n<p><strong>FARMING AND CUISINE<br \/>\n<\/strong>The sagas tell about the diet and cuisine of the Vikings, but first-hand evidence, like cesspits, kitchen middens and garbage dumps have proved to be of great value and importance. Undigested remains of plants from cesspits at Coppergate in York have provided much information in this respect.<br \/>\nThe combined information from various sources suggests a diverse cuisine and ingredients. Meat products of all kinds, such as cured, smoked and whey-preserved meat, sausages, and boiled or fried fresh meat cuts, were prepared and consumed. There were plenty of seafood, bread, porridge, dairy products, vegetables, fruits, berries and nuts. Alcoholic drinks like beer, mead, bj\u00f3rr (a strong fruit wine) and, for the rich, imported wine, were served.<br \/>\nCertain livestock were typical and unique to the Vikings, including the\u00a0Icelandic horse,\u00a0Icelandic cattle, a plethora of sheep breeds,\u00a0the\u00a0Danish hen\u00a0and the\u00a0Danish goose.<br \/>\nThe Vikings in York mostly ate beef, mutton, and pork with small amounts of horse meat. Most of the beef and horse leg bones were found split lengthways, to extract the marrow. The mutton and swine were cut into leg and shoulder joints and chops. The frequent remains of pig skulls and foot bones found on house floors indicate that brawn and trotters were also popular. Hens were kept for both their meat and eggs, and the bones of game birds such as black grouse, golden plover, wild ducks, and geese have also been found.<br \/>\nSeafood was important, in some places even more so than meat. Whales and walrus were hunted for food in Norway and the northwestern parts of the North Atlantic region, and seals were hunted nearly everywhere. Oysters mussels, and shrimp were eaten in large quantities and cod and salmon were popular fish. In the southern regions, herring was also important.<br \/>\nMilk and\u00a0buttermilk\u00a0were popular, both as cooking ingredients and drinks, but were not always available, even at farms.\u00a0Milk came from cows, goats and sheep, with priorities varying from location to location,\u00a0and fermented milk products like\u00a0skyr\u00a0or\u00a0surmj\u00f6lk\u00a0were produced as well as butter and cheese.<br \/>\nFood was often salted and enhanced with spices, some of which were imported like black pepper, while others were cultivated in herb gardens or harvested in the wild. Homegrown spices included caraway, mustard and horseradish as evidenced from the Oseberg ship burial or dill, coriander, and wild celery, as found in cesspits at Coppergate in York. Thyme, juniper berry, sweet gale, yarrow, rue, and peppercress gale were also used and cultivated in herb gardens.<\/p>\n<p><strong>EVERYDAY LIFE IN THE VIKING AGE<br \/>\n<\/strong>Vikings collected and ate fruits, berries and nuts. Apple (wild\u00a0crab apples), plums and cherries were part of the diet,\u00a0as were\u00a0rose hips\u00a0and\u00a0raspberry,\u00a0wild strawberry,\u00a0blackberry,\u00a0elderberry,\u00a0rowan,\u00a0hawthorn\u00a0and various wild berries, specific to the locations.\u00a0Hazelnuts\u00a0were an important part of the diet in general and large amounts of\u00a0walnut\u00a0shells have been found in cities like Hedeby. The shells were used for dyeing, and it is assumed that the nuts were consumed.<br \/>\nThe invention and introduction of the\u00a0<strong>mould board plough<\/strong> revolutionized agriculture in Scandinavia in the early Viking Age and made it possible to farm even poor soils.<br \/>\nIn\u00a0Ribe, <strong>grains<\/strong> of rye, barley, oat and wheat dated to the 8th century have been found and examined, and are believed to have been cultivated locally. Grains and flour were used for making porridges, some cooked with milk, some cooked with fruit and sweetened with honey, and also various forms of bread. Remains of bread from primarily Birka in Sweden were made of barley and wheat. It is unclear if the Norse leavened their bread, but their ovens and baking utensils suggest that they did.<br \/>\n<strong>Flax<\/strong>\u00a0was a very important crop for the Vikings: it was used for oil extraction, food consumption and most importantly the production of\u00a0linen. More than 40% of all known textile recoveries from the Viking Age can be traced as linen. This suggests a much higher actual percentage, as linen is poorly preserved compared to wool for example.<br \/>\nThe quality of food for common people was not always particularly high. The research at Coppergate shows that the Vikings in York made bread from whole meal flour \u2014 probably both wheat and rye \u2013 but with the seeds of cornfield weeds included. Corncockle (Agrostemma), would have made the bread dark-coloured, but the seeds are poisonous, and people who ate the bread might have become ill. Seeds of carrots, parsnip, and brassicas were also discovered, but they were poor specimens and tend to come from white carrots and bitter-tasting cabbages. The rotary querns often used in the Viking Age left tiny stone fragments (often from basalt rock) in the flour, which when eaten wore down the teeth. The effects of this can be seen in the skeletal remains of that period.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SPORTS<br \/>\n<\/strong>Sports were widely practiced and encouraged by the Vikings.\u00a0Sports that involved weapons training and developing combat skills were popular. This included spear and stone throwing, building and testing <strong>physical strength<\/strong> through wrestling, fist fighting, and stone lifting.<br \/>\nIn areas with mountains, mountain climbing was practised as a sport. Agility and balance were built and tested by running and jumping for sport, and there is mention of a sport that involved jumping from oar to oar on the outside of a ship&#8217;s railing as it was being rowed. Swimming is a popular sport and Snorri Sturluson describes three types: diving, long-distance swimming and a contest in which two swimmers try to duck one another.<br \/>\nChildren often participated in some of the sports disciplines and women have also been mentioned as swimmers, although it is unclear if they took part in competition. King Olaf Tryggvason was hailed as a master of both mountain climbing and oar-jumping and was said to have excelled in the art of knife juggling as well.<br \/>\n<strong>Skiing\u00a0and\u00a0ice skating<\/strong> were the primary winter sports of the Vikings, although skiing was also used as an everyday means of transport in winter and in the colder regions of the north.<br \/>\n<strong>Horse fighting<\/strong> was practised for sport, although the rules are unclear. It appears to have involved two stallions pitted against each other, within the smell and sight of fenced-off mares. Whatever the rules were, the fights often resulted in the death of one of the stallions.<br \/>\nIcelandic sources refer to the sport of\u00a0<strong>knattleik<\/strong>. A ball game akin to\u00a0hockey, knattleik involved a bat and a small hard ball and was usually played on a smooth field of ice. The rules are unclear, but it was popular with both adults and children, even though it often led to injuries. Knattleik appears to have been played only in Iceland, where it attracted many spectators, as did horse fighting.<br \/>\n<strong>Hunting<\/strong>, as a sport, was limited to Denmark, where it was not regarded as an important occupation. Birds, deer, hares and foxes were hunted with bow and spear, and later with crossbows. The techniques were stalking, snaring and traps and par force hunting with dog packs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GAMES AND ENTERTAINMENT<br \/>\n<\/strong>Both archaeological finds and written sources testify to the fact that the Vikings set aside time for social and festive gatherings.<br \/>\nBoard games and dice games were played as a popular pastime at all levels of society. Preserved gaming pieces and boards show game boards made of easily available materials like wood, with game pieces manufactured from stone, wood or bone, while other finds include elaborately carved boards and game pieces of glass,\u00a0amber,\u00a0antler\u00a0or\u00a0walrus\u00a0tusk, together with materials of foreign origin, such as\u00a0ivory. The Vikings played several types of\u00a0tafl\u00a0games;\u00a0hnefatafl,\u00a0nitavl (Nine Men&#8217;s Morris) and the less common\u00a0kvatrutafl.\u00a0Chess\u00a0also appeared at the end of the Viking Age. Hnefatafl is a war game, in which the object is to capture the king piece\u2014a large hostile army threatens and the king&#8217;s men have to protect the king. It was played on a board with squares using black and white pieces, with moves made according to dice rolls. The\u00a0Ockelbo Runestone\u00a0shows two men engaged in Hnefatafl, and the sagas suggest that money or valuables could have been involved in some dice games.<br \/>\nOn festive occasions, storytelling, skaldic poetry, music and alcoholic drinks, like beer and mead, contributed to the atmosphere. Music was considered an art form and music proficiency was fitting for a cultivated man. The Vikings are known to have played instruments including harps, fiddles, lyres and lutes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>EXPERIMENTAL ARCHAEOLOGY<br \/>\n<\/strong>Experimental archaeology\u00a0of the Viking Age is a flourishing branch and several places have been dedicated to this technique, such as\u00a0Jorvik Viking Centre\u00a0in the United Kingdom,\u00a0Sagnlandet Lejre\u00a0and\u00a0Ribe Viking Center\u00a0in Denmark,\u00a0Foteviken Museum\u00a0in Sweden or\u00a0Lofotr Viking Museum\u00a0in Norway. Viking-age\u00a0reenactors\u00a0have undertaken experimental activities such as iron smelting and forging using Norse techniques at\u00a0Norstead\u00a0in Newfoundland for example.<br \/>\nOn 1 July 2007, the reconstructed Viking ship\u00a0Skuldelev 2, renamed\u00a0Sea Stallion began a Stallion journey from Roskilde to Dublin. The remains of that ship and four others were discovered during a 1962 excavation in the Roskilde Fjord. Tree-ring analysis has shown the ship was built of oak in the vicinity of Dublin in about 1042. Seventy multi-national crew members sailed the ship back to its home, and\u00a0Sea Stallion\u00a0arrived outside Dublin&#8217;s Custom House on 14 August 2007. The purpose of the voyage was to test and document the seaworthiness, speed, and manoeuvrability of the ship on the rough open sea and in coastal waters with treacherous currents. The crew tested how the long, narrow, flexible hull withstood the tough ocean waves. The expedition also provided valuable new information on Viking longships and society. The ship was built using Viking tools, materials, and much the same methods as the original ship.<br \/>\nOther vessels, often replicas of the\u00a0Gokstad ship\u00a0(full- or half-scale) or\u00a0Skuldelev I\u00a0have been built and tested as well. The\u00a0Snorri\u00a0(a\u00a0Skuldelev I\u00a0Knarr), was sailed from Greenland to Newfoundland in 1998.<\/p>\n<p><strong>WEAPONS AND WARFARE<br \/>\n<\/strong>Knowledge about the arms and armour of the Viking age is based on archaeological finds, pictorial representation, and to some extent on the accounts in the\u00a0Norse sagas\u00a0and\u00a0Norse laws\u00a0recorded in the 13th century. According to custom, all free Norse men were required to own weapons and were permitted to carry them at all times. These arms were indicative of a Viking&#8217;s social status: a wealthy Viking had a complete ensemble of a\u00a0helmet,\u00a0shield,\u00a0mail\u00a0shirt, and sword. However, swords were rarely used in battle, probably not sturdy enough for combat and most likely only used as symbolic or decorative items.<br \/>\nA typical b\u00f3ndi (freeman) was more likely to fight with a spear and shield, and most also carried a seax as a utility knife and side arm. Bows were used in the opening stages of land battles and at sea, but they tended to be considered less &#8220;honourable&#8221; than melee weapons. Vikings were relatively unusual for the time in their use of axes as a main battle weapon. The H\u00fascarls, the elite guard of King Cnut (and later of King Harold II) were armed with two-handed axes that could split shields or metal helmets with ease.<br \/>\nThe warfare and violence of the Vikings were often motivated and fuelled by their beliefs in the Norse religion, focusing on Thor and Odin, the gods of war and death. In combat, it is believed that the Vikings sometimes engaged in a disordered style of frenetic, furious fighting known as berserkergang, leading them to be termed berserkers. Such tactics may have been deployed intentionally by shock troops, and the berserk state may have been induced through ingestion of materials with psychoactive properties, such as the hallucinogenic mushrooms, Amanita muscaria, or large amounts of alcohol.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TRADE<br \/>\n<\/strong>The Vikings established and engaged in extensive trading networks throughout the known world and had a profound influence on the economic development of Europe and Scandinavia, not the least. They were very open to new ideas and were able to barter in many languages.<br \/>\nExcept for the major trading centres of\u00a0Ribe,\u00a0Hedeby\u00a0and the like, the Viking world was unfamiliar with the use of\u00a0coinage\u00a0and was based on so called\u00a0bullion\u00a0economy.\u00a0Silver\u00a0was the most common metal in the economy, although\u00a0gold\u00a0was also used to some extent. Silver circulated in the form of bars, or\u00a0ingots, as well as in the form of jewelry and ornaments. A large number of silver hoards from the Viking Age have been uncovered, both in Scandinavia and the lands they settled. Traders carried small scales, enabling them to measure weight very accurately, so it was possible to have a very precise system of trade and exchange, even without a regular coinage<br \/>\n<strong>Goods<br \/>\n<\/strong>Organized trade covered everything from ordinary items in bulk to exotic luxury products. The Viking ship designs, like that of the Knarr, were an important factor in their success as merchants. Imported goods from other cultures included:<br \/>\n<strong>Spices<\/strong>\u00a0were obtained from Chinese and Persian traders, who met with the Viking traders in Russia. Vikings used homegrown spices and herbs like\u00a0caraway,\u00a0thyme,\u00a0horseradish\u00a0and\u00a0mustard,\u00a0but imported\u00a0cinnamon.<br \/>\n<strong>Glass<\/strong>\u00a0was much prized by the Norse. The imported glass was often made into beads for decoration and these have been found in their thousands.\u00a0\u00c5hus\u00a0in Scania and the old market town of Ribe had major production of glass beads.<br \/>\n<strong>Silk<\/strong> was a very important commodity obtained from\u00a0Byzantium\u00a0(modern-day\u00a0Istanbul) and China. It was valued by many European cultures of the time, and the Vikings used it to illustrate status such as wealth and nobility. Many of the archaeological finds in Scandinavia include silk.<br \/>\n<strong>Wine<\/strong>\u00a0was imported from France and Germany as a drink of the wealthy, to vary the regular mead and\u00a0beer.<br \/>\nTo counter these valuable imports, the Vikings exported a large variety of goods. These goods included:<br \/>\n<strong>Amber<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 the fossilized resin of the pine tree\u00a0\u2013 was frequently found on the\u00a0North Sea\u00a0and\u00a0Baltic\u00a0coastline. It was worked into beads and ornamental objects, before being traded.<br \/>\n<strong>Fur<\/strong> was also exported as it provided warmth. This included the furs of\u00a0pine martens,\u00a0foxes,\u00a0bears,\u00a0otters\u00a0and\u00a0beavers.<br \/>\n<strong>Cloth and\u00a0wool.<\/strong> The Vikings were skilled spinners and weavers and exported woollen cloth of a high quality.<br \/>\n<strong>Down<\/strong>\u00a0was collected and exported. The Norwegian west coast supplied eiderdowns and sometimes feathers were bought from the\u00a0Samis. Down was used for bedding and quilted clothing.\u00a0Fowling\u00a0on the steep slopes and cliffs was dangerous work and was often lethal.<br \/>\n<strong>Slaves,<\/strong> known as\u00a0thralls\u00a0in Old Norse. On their raids, the Vikings captured many people, among them monks and clergymen. They were sometimes sold as slaves to Arab merchants in exchange for silver.<br \/>\n<strong>Other exports<\/strong> included weapons,\u00a0walrus ivory,\u00a0wax,\u00a0salt\u00a0and\u00a0cod. As one of the more exotic exports,\u00a0hunting birds\u00a0were sometimes provided from Norway to the European aristocracy, from the 10th century.<br \/>\nMany of these goods were also traded within the Viking world itself, as well as goods such as soapstone and whetstone. Soapstone was traded with the Norse on Iceland and in Jutland, who used it for pottery. Whetstones were traded and used for sharpening weapons, tools and knives. There are indications from Ribe and surrounding areas, that the extensive medieval trade with oxen and cattle from Jutland reached as far back as c. 720 AD. This trade satisfied the Vikings&#8217; need for leather and meat to some extent and perhaps hides for parchment production on the European mainland. Wool was also very important as a domestic product for the Vikings, to produce warm clothing for the cold Scandinavian and Nordic climate, and for sails. Sails for Viking ships required large amounts of wool, as evidenced by experimental archaeology. There are archaeological signs of organized textile productions in Scandinavia, reaching as far back as the early Iron Ages. Artisans and craftsmen in the larger towns were supplied with antlers from organized hunting with large-scale reindeer traps in the far north. They were used as raw materials for making everyday utensils like combs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>LEGACY<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Medieval perceptions<br \/>\n<\/strong>In England, the Viking Age began dramatically on 8 June 793 when Norsemen destroyed the abbey on the island of Lindisfarne. The devastation of Northumbria&#8217;s Holy Island shocked and alerted the royal courts of Europe to the Viking presence. &#8220;Never before has such an atrocity been seen,&#8221; declared the Northumbrian scholar Alcuin of York.<br \/>\nMedieval Christians in Europe were unprepared for the Viking incursions and could find no explanation for their arrival and the accompanying suffering they experienced at their hands save the &#8220;Wrath of God&#8221;. More than any other single event, the attack on Lindisfarne demonized the perception of the Vikings for the next twelve centuries. Not until the 1890s did scholars outside Scandinavia begin to seriously reassess the achievements of the Vikings, recognizing their artistry, technological skills, and seamanship.<br \/>\nNorse Mythology, sagas, and\u00a0literature\u00a0tell of Scandinavian culture and religion through tales of heroic and mythological heroes. Early transmission of this information was primarily oral, and later texts were reliant upon the writings and transcriptions of Christian scholars, including the\u00a0Icelanders\u00a0Snorri Sturluson and\u00a0S\u00e6mundur fr\u00f3\u00f0i. Many of these sagas were written in Iceland, and most of them, even if they had no Icelandic provenance, were preserved there after the Middle Ages due to the continued interest of Icelanders in Norse literature and law codes.<br \/>\nThe 200-year Viking influence on European history is filled with tales of plunder and colonization, and the majority of these chronicles came from Western witnesses and their descendants. Less common, though equally relevant, are the Viking chronicles that originated in the east, including the Nestor chronicles, Novgorod chronicles, Ibn Fadlan chronicles, Ibn Rusta chronicles, and brief mentions by Photius, patriarch of Constantinople, regarding their first attack on the Byzantine Empire. Other chroniclers of Viking history include Adam of Bremen, who wrote, in the fourth volume of his Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum, &#8220;[there is much gold here (in Zealand), accumulated by piracy. These pirates, which are called wichingi by their own people, and Ascomanni by our own people, pay tribute to the Danish king.&#8221; In 991, the Battle of Maldon between Viking raiders and the inhabitants of Maldon in Essex was commemorated with a poem of the same name.<br \/>\n<strong>Post-medieval perceptions<br \/>\n<\/strong>Early modern publications, dealing with what is now called Viking culture, appeared in the 16th century, e.g.\u00a0Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus\u00a0(Olaus Magnus, 1555), and the first edition of the 13th-century\u00a0Gesta Danorum\u00a0of\u00a0Saxo Grammaticus\u00a0in 1514. The pace of publication increased during the 17th century with Latin translations of the\u00a0Edda.<br \/>\nIn Scandinavia, the 17th-century Danish scholars\u00a0Thomas Bartholin\u00a0and\u00a0Ole Worm\u00a0and the Swede\u00a0Olaus Rudbeck used runic inscriptions and Icelandic sagas as historical sources. An important early British contributor to the study of the Vikings was George Hicke, who published his\u00a0Linguarum vett. septentrionalium thesaurus\u00a0in 1703\u201305. During the 18th century, British interest and enthusiasm for Iceland and early Scandinavian culture grew dramatically, expressed in English translations of Old Norse texts and in original poems that extolled the supposed Viking virtues.<br \/>\nThe word &#8220;Viking&#8221; was first popularised at the beginning of the 19th century by Erik Gustaf Geijer in his poem, The Viking. Geijer&#8217;s poem did much to propagate the new romanticized ideal of the Viking, which had little basis in historical fact. The renewed interest in Romanticism in the Old North had contemporary political implications. The Geatish Society, of which Geijer was a member, popularised this myth to a great extent. Another Swedish author who had a great influence on the perception of the Vikings was Esaias Tegn\u00e9r, a member of the Geatish Society, who wrote a modern version of Fri\u00f0\u00fej\u00f3fs saga hins fr\u0153kna, which became widely popular in the Nordic countries, the United Kingdom, and Germany.<br \/>\nFascination with the Vikings reached a peak during the so-called Viking revival in the late 18th and 19th centuries as a branch of Romantic nationalism. In Britain, this was called Septentrionalism, in Germany &#8220;Wagnerian&#8221; pathos, and in the Scandinavian countries Scandinavism. Pioneering 19th-century scholarly editions of the Viking Age began to reach a small readership in Britain, archaeologists began to dig up Britain&#8217;s Viking past, and linguistic enthusiasts started to identify the Viking-Age origins of rural idioms and proverbs. The new dictionaries of the Old Norse language enabled the Victorians to grapple with the primary Icelandic sagas.<br \/>\nUntil recently, the history of the Viking Age was largely based on Icelandic sagas, the history of the Danes written by Saxo Grammaticus, the Russian\u00a0Primary Chronicle, and\u00a0Cogad G\u00e1edel re Gallaib. Few scholars still accept these texts as reliable sources, as historians now rely more on archaeology and\u00a0numismatics, disciplines that have made valuable contributions toward understanding the period.<br \/>\n<strong>In 20th-century politics<br \/>\n<\/strong>The romanticized idea of the Vikings constructed in scholarly and popular circles in northwestern Europe in the 19th and early 20th centuries was a potent one, and the figure of the Viking became a familiar and malleable symbol in different contexts in the politics and political ideologies of 20th-century Europe. In Normandy, which had been settled by Vikings, the Viking ship became an uncontroversial regional symbol. In Germany, awareness of Viking history in the 19th century had been stimulated by the border dispute with Denmark over Schleswig-Holstein and the use of Scandinavian mythology by Richard Wagner. The idealized view of the Vikings appealed to Germanic supremacists who transformed the figure of the Viking by the ideology of the Germanic master race. Building on the linguistic and cultural connections between Norse-speaking Scandinavians and other Germanic groups in the distant past, Scandinavian Vikings were portrayed in Nazi Germany as a pure Germanic type. The cultural phenomenon of Viking expansion was re-interpreted for use as propaganda to support the extreme militant nationalism of the Third Reich, and ideologically informed interpretations of Viking paganism and the Scandinavian use of runes were employed in the construction of Nazi mysticism.<br \/>\nOther political organizations of the same ilk, such as the former Norwegian fascist party\u00a0Nasjonal Samling, similarly appropriated elements of the modern Viking cultural myth in their symbolism and propaganda. In communist Russia, the ideology of Slavic racial purity led to the complete denial that Scandinavians had played a part in the emergence of the principalities of the Rus&#8217;, which were supposed to have been founded by Slavs. Evidence to the contrary was suppressed until the 1990s. Novgorod now enthusiastically acknowledges its Viking history and has included a Viking ship in its logo.<br \/>\n<strong>In modern popular culture<br \/>\n<\/strong>Led by the operas of German composer Richard Wagner, such as Der Ring des Nibelungen, Vikings and the Romanticist Viking Revival have inspired many creative works. These have included novels directly based on historical events, such as Frans Gunnar Bengtsson&#8217;s The Long Ships (which was also released as a 1963 film), and historical fantasies such as the film The Vikings, Michael Crichton&#8217;s Eaters of the Dead (movie version called The 13th Warrior), and the comedy film Erik the Viking. The vampire Eric Northman, in the HBO TV series True Blood, was a Viking prince before being turned into a vampire. Vikings appear in several books by the Danish-American writer Poul Anderson, while British explorer, historian, and writer Tim Severin authored a trilogy of novels in 2005 about a young Viking adventurer Thorgils Leifsson, who travels around the world.<br \/>\nIn 1962, American comic book writer\u00a0Stan Lee\u00a0and his brother\u00a0Larry Lieber, together with\u00a0Jack Kirby, created the\u00a0Marvel Comics\u00a0superhero\u00a0Thor, which they based on the Norse god of the same name. The character is featured in the 2011\u00a0Marvel Studios\u00a0film\u00a0Thor\u00a0and its sequels\u00a0Thor: The Dark World\u00a0and\u00a0Thor: Ragnarok. The character also appears in the 2012 film\u00a0The Avengers\u00a0and its associated\u00a0animated series.<br \/>\nSince the 1960s, there has been rising enthusiasm for historical reenactment. While the earliest groups had little claim for historical accuracy, the seriousness and accuracy of reenactors have increased. The largest such groups include The Vikings and Regia Anglorum, though many smaller groups exist in Europe, North America, New Zealand, and Australia. Many reenactor groups participate in live-steel combat, and a few have Viking-style ships or boats.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Minnesota Vikings\u00a0of the\u00a0National Football League\u00a0are so-named owing to the large Scandinavian population in the US state of\u00a0Minnesota.<br \/>\nDuring the banking boom of the first decade of the twenty-first century, Icelandic financiers came to be styled as \u00fatr\u00e1sarv\u00edkingar (roughly &#8216;raiding Vikings&#8217;).<br \/>\nModern reconstructions of\u00a0Viking mythology\u00a0have shown a persistent influence in late 20th- and early 21st-century popular culture in some countries, inspiring comics, role-playing games, computer games, and music, including\u00a0Viking metal, a subgenre of\u00a0heavy metal music.<\/p>\n<p><strong>COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Horned helmets<\/strong>. Apart from two or three representations of (ritual) helmets\u2014with protrusions that may be either stylized ravens, snakes, or horns\u2014no depiction of the helmets of Viking warriors, and no preserved helmet, has horns. The formal, close-quarters style of Viking combat (either in shield walls or aboard &#8220;ship islands&#8221;) would have made horned helmets cumbersome and hazardous to the warrior&#8217;s side.<br \/>\nHistorians therefore believe that Viking warriors did not wear horned helmets; whether such helmets were used in Scandinavian culture for other, ritual purposes, remains unproven. The general misconception that Viking warriors wore horned helmets was partly promulgated by the 19th-century enthusiasts of\u00a0G\u00f6tiska F\u00f6rbundet, founded in 1811 in\u00a0Stockholm.\u00a0They promoted the use of Norse mythology as the subject of high art and other ethnological and moral aims.<br \/>\nThe Vikings were often depicted with winged helmets and in other clothing taken from Classical antiquity, especially in depictions of Norse gods. This was done to legitimize the Vikings and their mythology by associating it with the Classical world, which had long been idealized in European culture.<br \/>\nThe latter-day\u00a0mythos\u00a0created by\u00a0national romantic ideas\u00a0blended the Viking Age with aspects of the\u00a0Nordic Bronze Age\u00a0some 2,000 years earlier. Horned helmets from the Bronze Age were shown in\u00a0petroglyphs\u00a0and appeared in archaeological finds (see\u00a0Bohusl\u00e4n\u00a0and\u00a0Vikso\u00a0helmets). They were probably used for ceremonial purposes.<br \/>\nCartoons like\u00a0H\u00e4gar the Horrible\u00a0and\u00a0Vicky the Viking, and sports kits such as those of the\u00a0Minnesota Vikings\u00a0and\u00a0Canberra Raiders\u00a0have perpetuated the myth of the horned helmet.<br \/>\nViking helmets were conical, made from hard leather with wood and metallic reinforcement for regular troops. The iron helmet with mask and mail was for the chieftains, based on the previous\u00a0Vendel-age helmets from central Sweden. The only original Viking helmet discovered is the\u00a0Gjermundbu helmet, found in Norway. This helmet is made of iron and has been dated to the 10th century.<br \/>\n<strong>Barbarity<\/strong>. The image of wild-haired, dirty savages sometimes associated with the Vikings in popular culture is a distorted picture of reality.\u00a0Viking tendencies were often misreported, and the work of Adam of Bremen, among others, told largely disputable tales of Viking savagery and uncleanliness.<br \/>\n<strong>Use of skulls as drinking vessels.<\/strong> There is no evidence that Vikings drank out of the skulls of vanquished enemies. This was a misconception based on a passage in the Skaldic poem Kr\u00e1kum\u00e1l speaking of heroes drinking from \u00f3r bj\u00fagvi\u00f0um hausa (branches of skulls). This was a reference to drinking horns but was mistranslated in the 17th century as referring to the skulls of the slain.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GENETIC LEGACY<br \/>\n<\/strong>Studies of genetic diversity provide an indication of the origin and expansion of the Viking population. Haplogroup I-M253 (defined by specific genetic markers on the Y chromosome) mutation occurs with the greatest frequency among Scandinavian males: 35% in Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, and peaking at 40% in southwestern Finland. It is also common near the southern Baltic and North Sea coasts and successively decreases further to the south geographically.<br \/>\nFemale descent studies show evidence of Norse descent in areas closest to Scandinavia, such as the Shetland and\u00a0Orkney\u00a0islands.<br \/>\nInhabitants of lands farther away show most Norse descent in the male\u00a0Y-chromosome\u00a0lines.<br \/>\nA specialized genetic and surname study in\u00a0Liverpool\u00a0showed marked Norse heritage: up to 50% of males of families that lived there before the years of industrialization and population expansion.\u00a0High percentages of Norse inheritance\u2014tracked through the R-M420 haplotype\u2014were also found among males in the\u00a0Wirral\u00a0and\u00a0West Lancashire.\u00a0This was similar to the percentage of Norse inheritance found among males in the Orkney Islands.<br \/>\nRecent research suggests that the\u00a0Celtic\u00a0warrior\u00a0Somerled, who drove the Vikings out of western Scotland and was the progenitor of\u00a0Clan Donald, may have been of\u00a0Viking descent, a member of haplogroup R-M420.<\/p>\n<div class=\"VZTD UeCOM jIRH oimqG DjbQm UwdmX Xmrlz ReShI KaJdY lqtkC ssImf HfYhe RTHNs \" data-testid=\"prism-GridContainer\">\n<div class=\"Kiog kNVGM nvpSA qwdi bmjsw \" data-testid=\"prism-GridRow\">\n<div class=\"theme-e oBTii mrzah \" data-testid=\"prism-GridColumn\">\n<div class=\"dHdHP jLREf zXXje aGO eCClZ nTLv jLsYA gmuro TOSFd VmeZt sCkVm hkQai wGrlE MUuGM fciaN qQjt DhNVo Tgcqk IGLAf tWjkv \">\n<div class=\"InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW \" data-testid=\"prism-inline-image\">\n<figure class=\"kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO \" data-testid=\"prism-figure\">\n<div class=\"GpQCA lZur \" data-testid=\"prism-ratio-frame\">\n<div class=\"FvQLF iLTd NqeUA UzzHi iWsMV \"><picture data-testid=\"prism-picture\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"hsDdd vBqtr KrDt itslR SjwtZ hakZw HlUVI \" draggable=\"false\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/25b41dbf-ba21-4cfd-8310-396cfedbf423\/resized-NationalGeographic_2495176.jpg\" alt=\"Reenactors don armor in preparation for close combat during the Festival of Slavs and Vikings in Wolin, Poland.\" data-testid=\"prism-image\" \/><\/picture><\/div>\n<\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur \" data-testid=\"prism-caption\">\n<div class=\"HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul \"><span class=\"hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz \" data-testid=\"prism-truncate\"><span class=\"gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ \">Reenactors dress up for the Festival of Slavs and Vikings in Wolin, Poland.

Perhaps artists were inspired by the distant echoes of ancient Greek and Roman historians, who had described northern Europeans as wearing helmets decorated with horns.
