It includes: Vineyards and production units of the town of Beaune and nearby villages and the historic center of Dijon.<br \/>\nA <em>terroir<\/em> (character) is the set of all environmental factors that affect a crop\u2019s phenotype, farming practices and crop\u2019s specific growth habitat. It is the basis of French wine appellation and regulation in France and around the world. The system presumes that the land from which the grapes are grown imparts a unique quality that is specific to growing the grapes (the plant\u2019s habitat). This includes the climate, soil type, geomorphology and organisms growing in, on and round the vine plots. This interaction is generally broken down from the macroclimate of a larger area (ex. Cote de Nuits region of Burgundy), down to the mesoclimate of a smaller subsection of the region (ex. the village of Vosne-Romanee) and even to the individual microclimate of a particular vineyard or row of grapevines (ex the Grand Cru vineyard of La Grande rue). The soil relates to the fertility, drainage and ability to retain heat. Geomorphology refers to the mountains, valleys, bodies of water, including the aspect of elevation of the vineyard location.<br \/>\nThe definition of terroir can be expanded to include the human controlled aspect \u2013 the grape variety planted, using wild or ambient yeast in the fermentation instead of cultured yeast, the use of oak (controversial) or whether organic over a conventional method of farming is used.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DIJON<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Mus\u00e9e Magnin<\/strong>.
