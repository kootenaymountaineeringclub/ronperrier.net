By August 2021, the Taliban had swept back into power. Their swift offensive came as the United States withdrew its remaining troops from Afghanistan as outlined in a 2020 peace agreement with the group.<\/p>\n<p>The Taliban have imposed a harsh interpretation of Islamic law despite pledges to respect the rights of women and religious and ethnic minority communities.

Their government has violently cracked down on demonstrations, and protesters and activists have been monitored and forcibly disappeared. They also reestablished their Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, which under their previous rule enforced prohibitions on behavior deemed un-Islamic. In November 2022, they ordered judges to enforce their interpretation of\u00a0<a title=\"sharia\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cfr.org\/backgrounder\/islam-governing-under-sharia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sharia<\/a>; in the weeks after, authorities\u00a0<a title=\"resumed public floggings\" href=\"https:\/\/news.un.org\/en\/story\/2022\/12\/1131782\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">resumed public floggings<\/a>\u00a0and executions.<\/p>\n<p>Women have seen their rights obliterated. The Taliban have prohibited most girls from attending secondary school, banned all women from attending and teaching at universities, and prevented women from working. In December 2022, the group prohibited women from working at local and international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).

In an\u00a0<a title=\"October 2022 report\" href=\"https:\/\/www.undp.org\/afghanistan\/publications\/one-year-review-afghanistan-august-2021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">October 2022 report<\/a>, the agency said that almost all Afghans were living in poverty. The economy has shrunk by up to 30 percent since the takeover, and an estimated seven hundred thousand jobs have been lost. More than\u00a0<a title=\"90 percent\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sigar.mil\/pdf\/quarterlyreports\/2022-07-30qr-section3-economic.pdf#page=3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">90 percent<\/a>\u00a0of the population has been suffering from some form of food insecurity. Exacerbating the crisis is a pause in aid by some countries and international organizations, which had been the lifeline of the economy and public health sector.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, the takeover brought an end to fighting that pitted Taliban fighters against U.S. and Afghan government forces. The country\u2019s overall security situation has improved and civilian casualties have declined. However,\u00a0<a title=\"violence remains widespread\" href=\"https:\/\/www.stimson.org\/2022\/afghanistan-under-the-taliban-findings-on-the-current-situation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">violence remains widespread<\/a>, particularly as the Islamic State in Khorasan terrorist group has increased attacks on civilians throughout the country.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-title-0-3\">Could Afghanistan again become a safe haven for terrorists?<\/h2>\n<p>International observers remain concerned that the Taliban supports terrorist organizations, particularly <a title=\"al-Qaeda\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cfr.org\/expert-brief\/al-qaedas-resurrection\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">al-Qaeda<\/a>, posing a threat to regional and international security. The United States invaded Afghanistan after it refused to hand over Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the 9\/11 attacks. Under the Taliban\u2019s rule, Afghanistan could become a safe haven for terrorists capable of launching attacks against the United States and its allies, experts say, despite Taliban statements that \u201cAfghanistan\u2019s soil\u00a0<a title=\"will not be used\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/middle-east-pakistan-afghanistan-arrests-islamabad-d50b1b490d27d32eb20cc11b77c12c87\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">will not be used\u00a0<\/a>against the security of any other country.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In its\u00a0<a title=\"April 2022 report\" href=\"https:\/\/www.undocs.org\/S\/2022\/419\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">April 2022 report<\/a>, the UN team that monitors the Taliban said the group \u201cremains close\u201d with al-Qaeda and that \u201cal-Qaeda has a safe haven under the Taliban and increased freedom of action.\u201d Indeed, in August, a U.S. drone strike\u00a0<a title=\"killed al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cfr.org\/in-brief\/what-zawahiris-killing-means-al-qaeda\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">killed al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri<\/a>\u00a0in Kabul. Reports suggested that Zawahiri was living in the home of a Taliban aide, and other al-Qaeda leaders are believed to be based in the country. The UN report said that al-Qaeda is likely using Afghanistan as a \u201cfriendly environment\u201d to recruit, train, and fundraise, although it is unlikely to launch an international attack before 2023 at the earliest. Following Zawahiri\u2019s killing, a\u00a0<a title=\"leaked U.S. assessment\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/08\/13\/us\/politics\/al-qaeda-afghanistan.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">leaked U.S. assessment<\/a>\u00a0said that al-Qaeda has not reconstituted its presence in Afghanistan, though some experts disagreed.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, violence has increased along\u00a0<a title=\"Afghanistan\u2019s border with Pakistan\" href=\"https:\/\/www.mei.edu\/publications\/pakistan-afghan-taliban-relations-face-mounting-challenges\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Afghanistan\u2019s border with Pakistan<\/a>, which has historically supported the Taliban. (Pakistan is thought to have provided\u00a0<a title=\"financial and logistical support\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cfr.org\/article\/pakistans-support-taliban-what-know\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">financial and logistical support<\/a>\u00a0to the Taliban during the U.S. war, though Islamabad denies this.) The Taliban\u2019s return to power has emboldened Tehrik-e-Taliban, a militant group sometimes referred to as the Pakistani Taliban. In late 2022, the group ended a cease-fire with the Pakistani government and launched attacks across the country. Pakistani officials have accused the Afghan Taliban of providing the militants with a safe haven in Afghanistan.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-title-0-4\">How has the world responded to the Taliban?<\/h2>\n<p>During the U.S. war in Afghanistan, governments and international bodies joined U.S.-led efforts to oust the Taliban and bolster Afghanistan\u2019s government, democratic institutions, and civil society. They have taken various actions since 2001:<\/p>\n<p><em>Military force.<\/em>\u00a0U.S. troops quickly overthrew the Taliban after they invaded Afghanistan in October 2001. The Taliban then waged an insurgency against the U.S.-backed Afghan government. The group withstood counterinsurgency operations from the world\u2019s most powerful security alliance, the\u00a0<a title=\"North Atlantic Treaty Organization\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cfr.org\/backgrounder\/north-atlantic-treaty-organization-nato\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">North Atlantic Treaty Organization<\/a>\u00a0(NATO), and three U.S. administrations over the course of a war that killed more than\u00a0<a title=\"6,000 U.S. troops and contractors\" href=\"https:\/\/watson.brown.edu\/costsofwar\/figures\/2021\/WarDeathToll\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">6,000 U.S. troops and contractors<\/a>\u00a0and over 1,100 NATO troops. Some 47,000 civilians died, and an estimated 73,000 Afghan troops and police officers were killed between 2007 and 2021. Tens of thousands of Taliban fighters are also believed to have died. The number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan peaked at around 100,000 in 2011. NATO assumed leadership of foreign forces in 2003, marking its first operational commitment outside of Europe. At its height, NATO had more than\u00a0<a title=\"130,000 troops\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nato.int\/cps\/en\/natohq\/topics_8189.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">130,000 troops<\/a>\u00a0from fifty nations stationed in Afghanistan. In the 2020 U.S.-Taliban agreement, the United States committed to\u00a0<a title=\"withdrawing all U.S. and NATO troops\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cfr.org\/in-brief\/us-troop-withdrawal-afghanistan-what-are-bidens-options\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">withdrawing all U.S. and NATO troops<\/a> from Afghanistan if the Taliban carried out commitments that included cutting ties with terrorist groups. The United States completed its troop withdrawal in August 2021.<\/p>\n<p><em>Sanctions.\u00a0<\/em>The UN Security Council first\u00a0<a title=\"imposed sanctions\" href=\"https:\/\/www.un.org\/securitycouncil\/sanctions\/1988\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">imposed sanctions<\/a>\u00a0on the regime for harboring al-Qaeda in 1999 and expanded the sanctions after 9\/11. They target Taliban leaders\u2019 financial assets and ban them from most travel. The Security Council also imposed an arms embargo on the Taliban. The United States and the European Union maintain additional sanctions, which have hindered aid deliveries since the Taliban\u2019s takeover. Meanwhile, the United States has blocked the Taliban from accessing billions of dollars in assets.<\/p>\n<p><em>Aid.\u00a0<\/em>For years, the Afghan government depended on assistance from dozens of countries;\u00a0<a title=\"75 percent\" href=\"https:\/\/www.worldbank.org\/en\/news\/press-release\/2019\/12\/05\/afghanistan-will-need-continued-international-support-after-political-settlement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">75 percent<\/a>\u00a0of the government\u2019s public expenditures were covered by grants from international partners, according to a 2019 World Bank report. Many of these countries suspended aid after the Taliban took over, sparking concerns of further economic turmoil. But in 2022, aid picked up, with donors providing over $2.6 billion. Since the takeover, the United States has provided\u00a0<a title=\"more than $1.1 billion\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sigar.mil\/pdf\/quarterlyreports\/2022-10-30qr.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more than $1.1 billion<\/a>\u00a0in aid. Still, UN officials said the commitments fell short of the country\u2019s humanitarian needs.<\/p>\n<p><em>Diplomatic ties<\/em>. Many Western countries, including the United States, shut down their diplomatic offices in Afghanistan after the Taliban took over. They have refused to recognize and establish diplomatic ties with the Taliban government, which calls the country the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. (A\u00a0<a title=\"handful of states\" href=\"https:\/\/www.voanews.com\/a\/russia-latest-country-to-establish-diplomatic-ties-with-taliban\/6521949.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">handful of states<\/a>, including China and Russia, have accredited Taliban-selected diplomats.) In addition, the UN General Assembly has indefinitely postponed a vote on who can represent Afghanistan at the United Nations.<\/p>\n<p><em>Investigation.\u00a0<\/em>The Taliban are now\u00a0<a title=\"under investigation\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cfr.org\/article\/iccs-probe-atrocities-afghanistan-what-know\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">under investigation<\/a>\u00a0by the International Criminal Court for alleged abuses of Afghan civilians, including crimes against humanity, carried out since 2003. U.S. and Afghan forces are also being investigated for alleged war crimes.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-title-0-5\">Who leads the Taliban?<\/h2>\n<p>The Taliban have been led for decades by a leadership council, called the Rahbari Shura. It is better known as the Quetta Shura, named for the city in Pakistan where Mullah Mohammed Omar, the Taliban\u2019s first leader, and his top aides are believed to have taken refuge after the U.S. invasion. (Omar died in 2013 and was succeeded by Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Mansour, who was killed in a 2016 U.S. air strike in Pakistan.) Today, the Rahbari Shura is thought by analysts to oversee the Taliban government\u2019s work, though its precise role is unclear. It is led by Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada, who has not been seen publicly in years. (Taliban officials said in 2022 that Akhundzada had visited Kabul, but no photos or videos of such an appearance were made public. An audio recording of a speech he reportedly gave\u00a0<a title=\"was released\" href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2022\/jul\/01\/taliban-leader-hits-out-foreign-demands-afghan-government\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">was released<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>The government is led by a thirty-three-member\u00a0<a title=\"caretaker cabinet\" href=\"https:\/\/www.longwarjournal.org\/archives\/2021\/09\/talibans-government-includes-designated-terrorists-ex-guantanamo-detainees.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">caretaker cabinet<\/a>. All ministers are men and are former Taliban officials or individuals loyal to the group. A majority are ethnic Pashtuns, and some are considered terrorists by the United States and are sanctioned by the United Nations. Mohammad Hassan Akhund, who was close with Omar, is acting prime minister. Taliban co-founder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, who led peace negotiations with the United States, is Akhund\u2019s deputy. Sirajuddin Haqqani\u2014who is acting head of the <a title=\"Haqqani Network\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cfr.org\/blog\/afghanistan-endgame-part-one-sirajuddin-haqqani-ready-peace\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Haqqani Network<\/a>, a militant group in Afghanistan\u2019s southeast and Pakistan\u2019s northwest with close ties to the Taliban, al-Qaeda, and Pakistan\u2019s intelligence services\u2014is the acting interior minister. Mullah Muhammad Yaqoub, Omar\u2019s son, is acting defense minister. Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi is the acting foreign minister, and Zabihullah Mujahid is the government\u2019s spokesperson.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-title-0-6\">How were the Taliban formed?<\/h2>\n<p>The group was formed in the early 1990s by Afghan mujahideen, or Islamic guerrilla fighters, who had resisted the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan (1979\u201389) with the covert backing of the CIA and its Pakistani counterpart, the Inter-Services Intelligence directorate (ISI).\u00a0They were joined by younger Pashtun tribesmen who studied in Pakistani madrassas, or seminaries; taliban is Pashto for \u201cstudents.\u201d Pashtuns comprise a plurality in Afghanistan and are the predominant ethnic group in much of the country\u2019s south and east. They are also a major ethnic group in Pakistan\u2019s north and west.<\/p>\n<p>The movement attracted popular support in the initial post-Soviet era by promising to impose stability and rule of law after four years of conflict (1992\u201396) among rival mujahideen groups. The Taliban\u00a0<a title=\"entered Kandahar\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nybooks.com\/articles\/archives\/2014\/jun\/05\/pakistan-worse-than-we-knew\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">entered Kandahar<\/a>\u00a0in November 1994 to pacify the crime-ridden southern city, and by September 1996 seized the capital, Kabul, from President Burhanuddin Rabbani, an ethnic Tajik whom they viewed as anti-Pashtun and corrupt. That year, the Taliban declared Afghanistan an Islamic emirate, with Mullah Mohammed Omar, a cleric and veteran of the anti-Soviet resistance, leading as\u00a0<em>amir al-mu\u2019minin<\/em>, or \u201ccommander of the faithful.\u201d The regime controlled some 90 percent of the country before its 2001 overthrow.<\/p>\n<p>The Taliban imposed a harsh brand of justice as they consolidated territorial control. Taliban jurisprudence was drawn from the Pashtuns\u2019 pre-Islamic tribal code and interpretations of sharia colored by the austere Wahhabi doctrines of the madrassas\u2019 Saudi benefactors. The regime neglected social services and other basic state functions even as the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice required women to wear the head-to-toe burqa, or\u00a0<em>chadri<\/em>; banned music and television; and jailed men whose beards it deemed too short.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-title-0-7\">What is the state of the Taliban\u2019s finances?<\/h2>\n<p>Foreign trade with Afghanistan has fallen since the takeover. Despite a decline in imports, however, most of the country\u2019s\u00a0<a title=\"revenue in 2022\" href=\"https:\/\/thedocs.worldbank.org\/en\/doc\/332619546fb9d365b5d3bcd4b270aa2d-0310012022\/original\/Afghanistan-Economic-Monitor-21-November-2022.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">revenue in 2022<\/a>\u00a0[PDF] came from taxes at border crossings. Additionally, it has increased coal exports to Pakistan. The Taliban government\u2019s proposed budget for fiscal year 2022 was $2.6 billion. (The previous government had a budget of around $6 billion in 2021.)<\/p>\n<p>Prior to the takeover, the Taliban primarily earned revenue through criminal activities, including opium poppy cultivation, drug trafficking, extortion of local businesses, and kidnapping, according to the UN monitoring group. In 2021, Afghanistan accounted for\u00a0<a title=\"86 percent\" href=\"https:\/\/www.unodc.org\/res\/wdr2022\/MS\/WDR22_Booklet_1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">86 percent<\/a>\u00a0[PDF] of the world\u2019s illicit opium production. However, in April 2022, the Taliban banned poppy cultivation.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-title-0-8\">Do Afghans support the Taliban?<\/h2>\n<p>For years after their fall from power in 2001, the Taliban enjoyed support. The Asia Foundation, a U.S.-based nonprofit organization, found in 2009\u00a0that half of Afghans\u2014mostly Pashtuns and rural Afghans\u2014had sympathy for armed opposition groups, primarily the Taliban. Afghan support for the Taliban and allied groups stemmed in part from grievances against public institutions.<\/p>\n<p>But in 2019, a response to the same survey found that only 13.4 percent of Afghans had\u00a0<a title=\"sympathy for the Taliban\" href=\"https:\/\/reliefweb.int\/report\/afghanistan\/survey-afghan-people-afghanistan-2019\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sympathy for the Taliban<\/a>. As intra-Afghan peace talks stalled in early 2021, an overwhelming majority surveyed said it was\u00a0<a title=\"important to protect\" href=\"https:\/\/asiafoundation.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/UpdatesFromDC_April-2021-Newsletter.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">important to protect<\/a>\u00a0[PDF] women\u2019s rights, freedom of speech, and the constitution.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-title-0-9\">Do any groups threaten the Taliban\u2019s power?<\/h2>\n<p>The Islamic State in Khorasan, with up to four thousand members in Afghanistan, has emerged as the Taliban\u2019s main military threat. The terrorist group has continued to launch attacks, particularly against minority communities such as the Hazaras, even as the Taliban work to eradicate it. Analysts say that the group\u2019s attacks on the embassies of China, Pakistan, and Russia in Kabul in late 2022 could hinder the countries\u2019 investment in Afghanistan. Amid the U.S. troop withdrawal, the Islamic State in Khorasan claimed responsibility for an attack near the Kabul airport that killed 13 U.S. service members and at least 170 Afghan civilians. According to the UN monitoring team, that attack elevated the group\u2019s status and led the self-declared Islamic State to provide an additional half a million dollars in funding for the group.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, a resistance movement of former officials, local militia members, and Afghan security forces who call themselves the\u00a0<a title=\"National Resistance Front\" href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/2022\/06\/08\/afghanistan-panjshir-valley-taliban-resistance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Resistance Front<\/a>\u00a0formed to oppose the Taliban\u2019s rule, though analysts say the group is currently not strong enough to threaten the Taliban\u2019s control.
