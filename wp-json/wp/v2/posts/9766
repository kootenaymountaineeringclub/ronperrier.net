The Hack<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The large, sunny room at Volgograd State University smelled like its contents: 45 college students, all but one of them male, hunched over keyboards, whispering and quietly clacking away among empty cans of Juicy energy drink. \u201cIt looks like they\u2019re just picking at their screens, but the battle is intense,\u201d Victor Minin said as we sat watching them.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/form>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<section id=\"article-section-1\">Clustered in seven teams from universities across Russia, they were almost halfway into an eight-hour hacking competition, trying to solve forensic problems that ranged from identifying a computer virus\u2019s origins to finding secret messages embedded in images. Minin was there to oversee the competition, called Capture the Flag, which had been put on by his organization, the Association of Chief Information Security Officers, or ARSIB in Russian. ARSIB runs Capture the Flag competitions at schools all over Russia, as well as massive, multiday hackathons in which one team defends its server as another team attacks it. In April, hundreds of young hackers participated in one of them.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-2\">\u201cI\u2019ve been doing cybersecurity since I was 18, since I joined the army in 1982,\u201d Minin told me after we\u2019d ducked out into the hallway so as not to distract the young contestants. He wouldn\u2019t say in which part of the army he\u2019d done this work. \u201cAt the time, I signed a gag order,\u201d he told me, smiling slyly. \u201cDo you think anything has changed? And that I\u2019d say it to a journalist?\u201d<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-3\">After the army, Minin joined the KGB. And when the Soviet Union collapsed, he went to work in the Russian government\u2019s cyber and surveillance division. In 2010, after he\u2019d retired and gone into the private sector, he helped found ARSIB, which has connections to the Russian defense ministry, the Federal Security Service (FSB), and the interior ministry.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"callout subscribe\"><\/aside>\n<p>The hacking competitions are Minin\u2019s way of preparing future generations, of \u201cpassing my accumulated knowledge on to the kiddies,\u201d he told me. He said Russian tech firms regularly come to him to find talent. I asked whether government agencies, like the security services that conduct cyberoperations abroad, did the same. \u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d he demurred. \u201cThey also need these specialists.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When the Capture the Flag competition broke for lunch, Minin and I stepped into the brightness and the wind outside. The university, a complex of stark white buildings, sits atop a steep hill with the city and the Volga River below. Once, the river was blood, and the hill was shrapnel and pillboxes and bones. Once, this was Stalingrad, a city made famous by the grueling battle fought here in the winter of 1942\u201343, when more than 1 million men died before the Germans lost the fight and a field marshal and the momentum of the war. Today, it is a haunted city.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-4\">\u201cHave you been to Mamayev Kurgan yet?,\u201d Minin asked me. He was referring to another hill, where the battle was so intense, it changed the hill\u2019s shape. Now the <i>Motherland Calls<\/i> statue stands there, a 170-foot concrete woman raising a sword to summon her countrymen into battle. It\u2019s where Nazi Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus was captured, Minin noted with reverence, and looked into the sunny distance. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s important to see how young people defended their homeland.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When we got to the cafeteria, I saw that it, too, was haunted by its Soviet past. Grouchy middle-aged women in hairnets dished out bland, greasy cuisine. If it weren\u2019t for students tapping at their smartphones, it would have been hard to tell that the 21st century had ever arrived. I sat down at a table with a team from Astrakhan and told them I had been to their hometown once, a romantically shabby old city by the Caspian Sea.<\/p>\n<p>The students smirked. \u201cEveryone wants to leave,\u201d a third-year named Anton said.\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to do there,\u201d his teammate Sergei added.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\u201cWe did an amazing job \u2026 creating the illusion that Putin controls everything in Russia \u2026 Now it\u2019s just funny\u201d how much Americans attribute to him.<\/span><\/aside>\n<p>Anton was hoping that Minin could help him get his foot in the door at one of the state security services. \u201cIt\u2019s prestigious, they pay well, and the work is interesting,\u201d he said. If he were accepted, he could hope for a salary of 50,000 rubles (less than $900) a month, which was almost double the average salary in Astrakhan. Was he motivated by any feelings of\u2014\u201cPatriotic conviction?,\u201d Anton finished my sentence, and started to chuckle. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t care what government I work for. If the French Foreign Legion takes me, I\u2019ll go!\u201d<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-5\">Isn\u2019t it sacrilege to say such things in a place like Volgograd?, I asked them.<\/p>\n<p>Sergei said the kind of patriotism being fostered in Russia these days was empty, even unhealthy. He\u2019d been angered by restrictions of online behavior imposed after the prodemocracy protests of 2011\u201312, and by government monitoring of online speech, which he called unconstitutional. \u201cAnd if you look at the state of our roads and our cities, and how people live in our city, you want to ask, why are they spending billions of rubles on storing people\u2019s personal information in massive databases?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to lock you up, Sergei,\u201d a classmate said, stealing a glance at my phone.\u00a0Sergei laughed. \u201cKeep chewing,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"dropcap\"><span class=\"caps\">O<\/span><span class=\"smallcaps\"><span class=\"caps\">ver the past<\/span> year<\/span>, Russian hackers have become the stuff of legend in the United States. According to U.S. intelligence assessments and media investigations, they were responsible for breaching the servers of the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. They spread the information they filched through friendly outlets such as WikiLeaks, to devastating effect. With President Vladimir Putin\u2019s blessing, they probed the voting infrastructure of various U.S. states. They quietly bought divisive ads and organized political events on Facebook, acting as the bellows in America\u2019s raging culture wars.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-6\">But most Russians don\u2019t recognize the Russia portrayed in this story: powerful, organized, and led by an omniscient, omnipotent leader who is able to both formulate and execute a complex and highly detailed plot.<\/p>\n<p>Gleb Pavlovsky, a political consultant who helped Putin win his first presidential campaign, in 2000, and served as a Kremlin adviser until 2011, simply laughed when I asked him about Putin\u2019s role in Donald Trump\u2019s election. \u201cWe did an amazing job in the first decade of Putin\u2019s rule of creating the illusion that Putin controls everything in Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s just funny\u201d how much Americans attribute to him.<\/p>\n<p>A businessman who is high up in Putin\u2019s United Russia party said over an espresso at a Moscow caf\u00e9: \u201cYou\u2019re telling me that everything in Russia works as poorly as it does, except our hackers? Rosneft\u201d\u2014the state-owned oil giant\u2014\u201cdoesn\u2019t work well. Our health-care system doesn\u2019t work well. Our education system doesn\u2019t work well. And here, all of a sudden, are our hackers, and they\u2019re amazing?\u201d<\/p>\n<aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The election hack \u201cwas a very emotional, tactical decision.\u201d The Kremlin was \u201cvery upset about the Panama Papers,\u201d which cast light on Putin\u2019s wealth.<\/span><\/aside>\n<p>In the same way that Russians overestimate America, seeing it as an all-powerful orchestrator of global political developments, Americans project their own fears onto Russia, a country that is a paradox of deftness, might, and profound weakness\u2014unshakably steady, yet somehow always teetering on the verge of collapse. Like America, it is hostage to its peculiar history, tormented by its ghosts.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-7\">None of these factors obviates the dangers Russia poses; rather, each gives them shape. Both Putin and his country are aging, declining\u2014but the insecurities of decline present their own risks to America. The United States intelligence community is unanimous in its assessment not only that Russians interfered in the U.S. election but that, in the words of former FBI Director James Comey, \u201cthey will be back.\u201d It is a stunning escalation of hostilities for a troubled country whose elites still have only a tenuous grasp of American politics. And it is classically Putin, and classically Russian: using daring aggression to mask weakness, to avenge deep resentments, and, at all costs, to survive.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d come to Russia to try to answer two key questions. The more immediate is how the Kremlin, despite its limitations, pulled off one of the greatest acts of political sabotage in modern history, turning American democracy against itself. And the more important\u2014for Americans, anyway\u2014is what might still be in store, and how far an emboldened Vladimir Putin is prepared to go in order to get what he wants.<picture><\/picture>\n<p class=\"dropcap\"><span class=\"caps\">\u201cI<span class=\"smallcaps\">t wasn\u2019t<\/span><\/span> a strategic operation,\u201d says Andrei Soldatov, a Russian journalist with deep sources in the security services, who writes about the Kremlin\u2019s use of cybertechnology. \u201cGiven what everyone on the inside has told me,\u201d he says, hacking the U.S. political system \u201cwas a very emotional, tactical decision. People were very upset about the Panama Papers.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-8\">In the spring of 2016, an international consortium of journalists began publishing revelations from a vast trove of documents belonging to a Panamanian law firm that specialized in helping its wealthy foreign clients move money, some of it ill-gotten, out of their home countries and away from the prying eyes of tax collectors. (The firm has denied any wrongdoing.) The documents revealed that Putin\u2019s old friend Sergei Roldugin, a cellist and the godfather to Putin\u2019s elder daughter, had his name on funds worth some $2 billion. It was an implausible fortune for a little-known musician, and the journalists showed that these funds were likely a piggy bank for Putin\u2019s inner circle. Roldugin has denied any wrongdoing, but the Kremlin was furious about the revelation. Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, whose wife was also implicated, angrily ascribed the reporting to \u201cmany former State Department and CIA employees\u201d and to an effort to \u201cdestabilize\u201d Russia ahead of its September 2016 parliamentary elections.<\/p>\n<p>The argument was cynical, but it revealed a certain logic: The financial privacy of Russia\u2019s leaders was on par with the sovereignty of Russia\u2019s elections. \u201cThe Panama Papers were a personal slight to Putin,\u201d says John Sipher, a former deputy of the CIA\u2019s Russia desk. \u201cThey think we did it.\u201d Putin\u2019s inner circle, Soldatov says, felt \u201cthey had to respond somehow.\u201d According to Soldatov\u2019s reporting, on April 8, 2016, Putin convened an urgent meeting of his national-security council; all but two of the eight people there were veterans of the KGB. Given the secrecy and timing of this meeting, Soldatov believes it was then that Putin gave the signal to retaliate.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-9\">The original aim was to embarrass and damage Hillary Clinton, to sow dissension, and to show that American democracy is just as corrupt as Russia\u2019s, if not worse. \u201cNo one believed in Trump, not even a little bit,\u201d Soldatov says. \u201cIt was a series of tactical operations. At each moment, the people who were doing this were filled with excitement over how well it was going, and that success pushed them to go even further.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of what they\u2019ve done was very opportunistic,\u201d says Dmitri Alperovitch, the Russian-born co-founder of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which first discovered the Russian interference after the company was hired to investigate the hack of the Democratic National Committee servers in May 2016. \u201cThey cast a wide net without knowing in advance what the benefit might be.\u201d The Russian hackers were very skilled, Alperovitch says, but \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t try to make them out to be eight feet tall\u201d and able to \u201celect whomever they want. They tried in Ukraine, and it didn\u2019t work.\u201d Nor did it work in the French elections of 2017.<\/p>\n<p>Alperovitch and his team saw that there had been two groups of hackers, which they believed came from two different Russian security agencies. They gave them two different monikers: Fancy Bear, from military intelligence, and Cozy Bear, from either foreign intelligence or the FSB. But neither bear seemed at all aware of what the other was doing, or even of the other\u2019s presence. \u201cWe observed the two Russian espionage groups compromise the same systems and engage separately in the theft of identical credentials,\u201d Alperovitch wrote on CrowdStrike\u2019s blog at the time. Western intelligence agencies, he noted, almost never go after the same target without coordinating, \u201cfor fear of compromising each other\u2019s operations.\u201d But \u201cin Russia this is not an uncommon scenario.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-10\">It was almost like one of Minin\u2019s hacking competitions, but with higher stakes. The hackers are not always guys in military-intelligence uniforms, Soldatov told me; in some cases they\u2019re mercenary freelancers willing to work for the highest bidder\u2014or cybercriminals who have been caught and blackmailed into working for the government. (Putin has denied \u201cstate level\u201d involvement in election meddling, but plausible deniability is the point of working through unofficial hackers.)<\/p>\n<p>American officials noticed the same messy and amorphous behavior as the summer of 2016 wore on. A former staffer in Barack Obama\u2019s administration says that intercepted communications between FSB and military-intelligence officers revealed arguing and a lack of organization. \u201cIt was ad hoc,\u201d a senior Obama-administration official who saw the intelligence in real time told me. \u201cThey were kind of throwing spaghetti at the wall and seeing what would stick.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<figure class=\"full-width\"><picture><\/picture><figcaption class=\"caption\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Vladimir Putin and Barack Obama at the G20 Summit in September 2016. Obama warned Putin against election meddling, but did not sanction Russia before Election Day\u2014Hillary Clinton, he believed, would handle Putin after she won.\u00a0<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<section id=\"article-section-11\">This chaos was, ironically, one reason the Russians ended up being successful in 2016. The bickering, opportunism, and lack of cooperation seemed to the Obama administration, at least initially, like the same old story. A report\u00a0published in January 2017 by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence assessing Russian involvement in the election noted that in 2008, a ring of 10 Russian spies, the most famous of whom was the fiery-haired Anna Chapman, had been in the U.S. in part to monitor the presidential election. But a Department of Justice complaint from 2010 paints a picture that is more <i>The Pink Panther<\/i> than <i>The Americans<\/i>. The spies, dubbed \u201cThe Illegals,\u201d went to think-tank events and summarized press coverage for Moscow; Chapman registered a burner phone with the address 99 Fake Street. (Chapman was arrested in 2010, and she and her compatriots were deported in a dramatic spy exchange.) The Obama administration seemed to be expecting something similar early in 2016. \u201cThey\u2019ve nibbled on the edges of our elections\u201d in the past, the former Obama-administration staffer told me. In 2008, the Illegals \u201chad been trying to cultivate think-tank people who might go into the administration.\u201d But Russia hadn\u2019t tried \u201cto affect the result of the election until this time.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-12\">When the Obama administration began to realize, in the summer, that the Russians were up to something more wide-ranging than what they\u2019d done before, the White House worried about only half the problem. At that point, the most alarming development was Russian probing of states\u2019 voting systems. The dumps of hacked data and the churn of false stories about Clinton seemed less troubling, and also harder to combat without looking political.<\/p>\n<p>In September, Obama approached Putin on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Hangzhou, China, and told him to \u201ccut it out.\u201d That fall, National-Security Adviser Susan Rice hand-delivered a warning to the Russian ambassador to Washington, Sergey Kislyak. The White House tasked the Treasury and State Departments with exploring new sanctions against Russia, as well as the publication of information about Putin\u2019s personal wealth, but decided that such moves might backfire. If the White House pushed too hard, the Russians might dump even more stolen documents. Who knew what else they had?<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, with just a month to go until the election, the Obama administration took the extraordinary step of alerting the public. On October 7, 2016, a joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said, \u201cThe U.S. Intelligence Community is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails\u201d from U.S. political organizations. \u201cThese thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-13\">The White House expected the media to run with the story, and they did\u2014\u201cfrom 3:30 to 4 p.m.,\u201d Ned Price, a former National Security Council spokesperson under Obama, said at this summer\u2019s Aspen Security Forum. But at 4 p.m., the statement was overtaken by a revelation of a different sort: the <i>Access Hollywood <\/i>tape, in which Trump bragged about sexually assaulting women. Both the media and the Clinton campaign focused almost exclusively on the explosive tape, not the intelligence-community statement.<\/p>\n<p>Even if the public notice went unheeded, the Obama administration felt that the Russians had heard its warnings behind the scenes. According to Soldatov and two former Obama-administration officials, Moscow seemed to have backed off its probes of U.S. election infrastructure by October. But the leaks and bogus news stories never stopped. Obama feared that going public with anything more would look like he was putting his thumb on the scale for Clinton. And he was sure that she would win anyway\u2014then deal with the Russians once she took office.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"caps\">T<span class=\"smallcaps\">he coup de gr\u00e2ce<\/span>,<\/span><b> <\/b>perhaps, was the receipt by the FBI of a dubious document that seemed to paint the Clinton campaign in a bad light. <i>The Washington Post <\/i>reported this spring on a memo, seemingly from Russian intelligence, that had been obtained by an FBI source during the presidential campaign. The memo claimed that then\u2013Attorney General Loretta Lynch had communicated with a Clinton campaign staffer, providing assurance that the FBI wouldn\u2019t pursue the investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server as secretary of state too strenuously. Sources close to James Comey told <i>The<\/i> <i>Post<\/i> that the document had \u201cplayed a major role\u201d in the way Comey, who as FBI director took fierce pride in his political independence, thought about the case, and had pushed him to make a public statement about it in July 2016. (He said he would bring no charges, but criticized Clinton sharply.) Comey\u2019s public comments about the investigation\u2014in July and then in October\u2014damaged Clinton greatly, possibly costing her the presidency. The document, the article noted, was a suspected Russian forgery.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-15\">A forgery, a couple of groups of hackers, and a drip of well-timed leaks were all it took to throw American politics into chaos. Whether and to what extent the Trump campaign was complicit in the Russian efforts is the subject of active inquiries today. Regardless, Putin pulled off a spectacular geopolitical heist on a shoestring budget\u2014about $200 million, according to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. This point is lost on many Americans: The subversion of the election was as much a product of improvisation and entropy as it was of long-range vision. What makes Putin effective, what makes him dangerous, is not strategic brilliance but a tactical flexibility and adaptability\u2014a willingness to experiment, to disrupt, and to take big risks.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey do plan,\u201d said a senior Obama-administration official. \u201cThey\u2019re not stupid at all. But the idea that they have this all perfectly planned and that Putin is an amazing chess player\u2014that\u2019s not quite it. He knows where he wants to end up, he plans the first few moves, and then he figures out the rest later. People ask if he plays chess or checkers. It\u2019s neither: He plays blackjack. He has a higher acceptance of risk. Think about it. The election interference\u2014that was pretty risky, what he did. If Hillary Clinton had won, there would\u2019ve been hell to pay.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Even the manner of the Russian attack was risky. The fact that the Russians didn\u2019t really bother hiding their fingerprints is a testament to the change in Russia\u2019s intent toward the U.S., Robert Hannigan, a former head of the Government Communications Headquarters, the British analogue to the National Security Agency, said at the Aspen Forum. \u201cThe brazen recklessness of it \u2026 the fact that they don\u2019t seem to care that it\u2019s attributed to them very publicly, is the biggest change.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-16\">That recklessness nonetheless has clear precursors\u2014both in Putin\u2019s evolving worldview and in his changing domestic circumstances. For more than a decade, America\u2019s strategic carelessness with regard to Russia has stoked Putin\u2019s fears of being deposed by the U.S., and pushed him toward ever higher levels of antagonism. So has his political situation\u2014the need to take ever larger foreign risks to shore up support at home, as the economy has struggled. These pressures have not abated; if anything, they have accelerated in recent years.<\/p>\n<h3>II. The History<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">When it is snowing, as it was on this spring afternoon, the gray crags of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations blend into the low-slung, steely sky. This is where the Soviet state once minted its diplomats and spies. Here they mastered the nuances of the world before stepping out into it. Today, the university\u2019s role is much the same, although it has been watered down by corruption: The wealthy often buy their children admission. I had been invited to listen to a lecture by one of the institute\u2019s most prominent faculty members, Andranik Migranyan, who himself graduated from the school in 1972. Migranyan spent much of the past decade in New York, where he ran the Institute for Democracy and Cooperation, a Russian think tank reported to have ties to the Russian foreign ministry. Among his old classmates is Sergei Lavrov, the foreign minister, whom he still counts as a friend.<\/span><\/h3>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-17\">This afternoon, Migranyan was lecturing on Putin\u2019s speech at the 2007 Munich Conference on Security Policy, a speech that seems to be Russia\u2019s sole post-Soviet ideological document\u2014and key to understanding how the relationship between Russia and the U.S. reached today\u2019s nadir. Putin, still a painfully awkward speaker at the time, was seven years into his now nearly two-decade reign. Eighteen years prior, in 1989, he had been a KGB officer stationed in Dresden, East Germany, shoveling sensitive documents into a furnace as protesters gathered outside and the Berlin Wall crumbled. Not long after that, the Soviet Union was dead and buried, and the world seemed to have come to a consensus: The Soviet approach to politics\u2014violent, undemocratic\u2014was wrong, even evil. The Western liberal order was a better and more moral form of government.<picture><\/picture>\n<p>For a while, Putin had tried to find a role for Russia within that Western order. When Boris Yeltsin, Russia\u2019s first post-Soviet president, named him his successor in 1999, Russia was waging war against Islamist separatists in Chechnya. On 9\/11, Putin was the first foreign leader to call President George W. Bush, hoping to impress on him that they were now allies in the struggle against terrorism. He tried to be helpful in Afghanistan. But in 2003, Bush ignored his objections to the invasion of Iraq, going around the United Nations Security Council, where Russia has veto power. It was a humiliating reminder that in the eyes of the West, Russia was irrelevant, that \u201cRussian objections carried no weight,\u201d as Migranyan told his students. But to Putin, it was something more: Under the guise of promoting democracy and human rights, Washington had returned to its Cold War\u2013era policy of deposing and installing foreign leaders. Even the open use of military force was now fair game.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-18\">In 2007, speaking to the representatives and defenders of the Western order, Putin officially registered his dissent. \u201cOnly two decades ago, the world was ideologically and economically split, and its security was provided by the massive strategic potential of two superpowers,\u201d Putin declaimed sullenly. But that order had been replaced by a \u201cunipolar world\u201d dominated only by America. \u201cIt is the world of one master, one sovereign.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A world order controlled by a single country \u201chas nothing in common with democracy,\u201d he noted pointedly. The current order was both \u201cunacceptable\u201d and ineffective. \u201cUnilateral, illegitimate action\u201d only created \u201cnew human tragedies and centers of conflict.\u201d He was referring to Iraq, which by that point had descended into sectarian warfare. The time had come, he said, \u201cto rethink the entire architecture of global security.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This was the protest of a losing side that wanted to renegotiate the terms of surrender, 16 years after the fact. Nonetheless, Putin has spent the decade since that speech making sure that the United States can never again unilaterally maneuver without encountering friction\u2014and, most important, that it can never, ever depose him.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou should have seen the faces of [John] McCain and [Joe] Lieberman,\u201d a delighted Migranyan told his students, who appeared to be barely listening. The hawkish American senators who attended Putin\u2019s speech \u201cwere gobsmacked. Russia had been written off! And Putin committed a mortal sin in Munich: He told the truth.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-19\">The year that followed, Migranyan said, \u201cwas the year of deed and action.\u201d Russia went to war with neighboring Georgia in 2008, a move that Migranyan described as a sort of comeuppance for <span class=\"smallcaps\">nato<\/span>, which had expanded to include other former Soviet republics. But Western encroachment on Russia\u2019s periphery was not the Kremlin\u2019s central grievance.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S., Migranyan complained, had also been meddling directly in Russian politics. American consultants had engineered painful post-Soviet market reforms, enriching themselves all the while, and had helped elect the enfeebled and unpopular Yeltsin to a second term in 1996. The U.S. government directly funded both Russian and American nongovernmental organizations, such as the National Endowment for Democracy, to promote democracy and civil society in Russia. Some of those same NGOs had ties to the so-called color revolutions, which toppled governments in former Soviet republics and replaced them with democratic regimes friendly to the West.<\/p>\n<p>The Rose Revolution in Georgia, the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan\u2014\u201cRussia looks at this with understandable mistrust,\u201d Migranyan told his students. He pointed out that the United States, by its own admission, had spent $5 billion in Ukraine to promote democracy\u2014that is, to expand the liberal Western order. Through this prism, it is not irrational to believe that the U.S. might be coming for Moscow\u2014and Putin\u2014next. This is why, in 2012, Russia kicked out USAID. It is why Russia banned the National Endowment for Democracy in 2015, under a new law that shuttered \u201cundesirable\u201d organizations.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Putin is said to have watched the video of Qaddafi\u2019s lynching over and over, obsessively. He feared the Americans would come for him next.<\/span><\/aside>\n<p>Putin\u2019s Munich doctrine has a corollary: Americans may think they\u2019re promoting democracy, but they\u2019re really spreading chaos. \u201cLook at what happened in Egypt,\u201d Migranyan said, beginning a litany of failed American-backed revolutions. In 2011, the Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak stepped down following protests the U.S. had supported, Migranyan contended. But after \u201cradical Islamists\u201d won power democratically, the U.S. turned a blind eye to a military coup that deposed the new leaders. Then there was Libya. \u201cYou toppled the most successful government in North Africa,\u201d Migranyan said, looking in my direction. \u201cIn the end, we got a ruined government, a brutally murdered American ambassador, chaos, and Islamic radicals.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-20\">\u201cIf we count all the American failures, maybe it\u2019s time you start listening to Russia?,\u201d Migranyan said, growing increasingly agitated. \u201cIf [Syrian President Bashar al-Assad] has to go, then who comes in, in place of Assad? \u2026 Don\u2019t destroy regimes if you don\u2019t know what comes after!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Putin had always been suspicious of democracy promotion, but two moments convinced him that America was coming for him under its guise. The first was the 2011 <span class=\"smallcaps\">nato<\/span> intervention in Libya, which led, ultimately, to the ousting and gruesome lynching of the Libyan dictator, Muammar Qaddafi. Afterward, many people who interacted with Putin noticed how deeply Qaddafi\u2019s death troubled him. He is said to have watched the video of the killing over and over. \u201cThe way Qaddafi died made a profound impact on him,\u201d says Jake Sullivan, a former senior State Department official who met repeatedly with senior Russian officials around that time. Another former senior Obama-administration official describes Putin as \u201cobsessed\u201d with Qaddafi\u2019s death. (The official concedes, \u201cI think we did overreach\u201d in Libya.)<\/p>\n<p>The second moment was in November 2013, when young Ukrainians came out onto the Maidan\u2014Independence Square\u2014in the capital, Kiev, to protest then-President Viktor Yanukovych pulling out of an economic agreement with the European Union under pressure from Putin. The demonstrators stayed all winter, until the police opened fire on them, killing some 100 people. The next day, February 21, 2014, Yanukovych signed a political-reconciliation plan, brokered by Russia, America, and the EU, but that night he fled the capital. To Putin, it was clear what had happened: America had toppled his closest ally, in a country he regarded as an extension of Russia itself. All that money America had spent on prodemocracy NGOs in Ukraine had paid off. The presence of Victoria Nuland, a State Department assistant secretary, handing out snacks on the Maidan during the protests, only cemented his worst fears.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-21\">\u201cThe Maidan shifted a gear,\u201d Ben Rhodes, Obama\u2019s deputy national-security adviser for strategic communications, told me. \u201cPutin had always been an antagonist, and aggressive. But he went on offense after the Maidan. The gloves were off, in a way. To Putin, Ukraine was such a part of Russia that he took it as an assault on him.\u201d (A source close to the Kremlin confirmed this account.)<\/p>\n<p>Putin and Lavrov were known within the Obama administration for their long tirades, chastising the American president for all the disrespect shown to Russia since 1991\u2014like the time in 2014 that Obama listed Russia and Ebola as global threats in the same speech. Yanukovych\u2019s fall made these tirades far more intense. \u201cFor two years afterwards, there wasn\u2019t a phone call in which [Putin] wouldn\u2019t mention it,\u201d accusing the U.S. of supporting regime change in Ukraine, Rhodes recalled.<\/p>\n<p>Regime change in Libya and Ukraine led to Russia propping up Bashar al-Assad in Syria. \u201cNot one more\u201d is how Jon Finer, former Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s chief of staff, characterizes Putin\u2019s approach in Syria. It also led inexorably to Russian meddling in the U.S. election: Russia would show the U.S. that there was more than one regime-change racket in town.<\/p>\n<h3>III. The Player<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">For Russia, a country relentlessly focused on its history, 2017 was a big year. November marked 100 years since the Bolsheviks, a radical minority faction of socialists, brought guns into a fledgling parliament and wrested Russia onto an equally radical path. That bloody experiment itself ended in 1991, with the collapse of the Soviet Union; December 2016 marked its 25th anniversary. Both anniversaries were largely ignored by the Kremlin-controlled media, because they are uncomfortable for Putin. Bolsheviks were revolutionaries and Putin, a statist to his core, loathes revolutions. But he was also raised to be a person of the Soviet state, to admire its many achievements, which is why he famously referred to the fall of the Soviet Union as \u201cthe greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century.\u201d<\/span><\/h3>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-22\">Putin governs with the twin collapses of 1917 and 1991 at the forefront of his thinking. He fears for himself when another collapse comes\u2014because collapse always comes, because it has already come twice in 100 years. He is constantly trying to avoid it. The exiled oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky has publicly spoken of deposing Putin, and until recently did not eschew violent means. People like Alexey Navalny, the opposition leader, openly talk about putting Putin and his closest associates on trial. The Russian opposition gleefully waits for Putin to fall, to resign, to die. Every misstep, every dip in oil prices, is to them just another sign of his coming personal apocalypse. The hungry anticipation is mirrored in the West, especially in the United States.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-23\">For the most part, the Kremlin is focused not on any positive development program, but on staving off that fate\u2014and on taking full advantage of its power before the state\u2019s inevitable demise. That\u2019s one reason corruption among the ruling elite is so breathtakingly brazen: A Russian businessman who works with government clients describes the approach as the \u201clast day of Pompeii,\u201d repeated over and over. Another businessman, who had just left the highest echelons of a big state-run bank out of frustration at its corruption and mismanagement, told me, \u201cRussia always rises from the ashes, time and time again. But I have a feeling that we\u2019re about to go through a time of ashes again.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-24\">Fear of collapse is also why Russian propaganda is intent on highlighting the bloody aftermath of revolutions the world over. Things may not be great in Russia now\u2014the country has struggled mightily since 2012\u2014but, the country\u2019s news programs suggest, things can always get worse. That\u2019s what Russians are told happened in the 1990s, in the nine frenetic years between the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse and Putin\u2019s ascent to power. \u201cWhen you have two governmental collapses in 100 years, people are scared of them,\u201d Migranyan told me. Many Russians remember the last one personally.<\/p>\n<p>But the number who do is shrinking. One in four Russian men dies before the age of 55. Putin turned 65 in October, and is surrounded by people who are as old as he is, if not older. Russia is now \u201cin an autumnal autocracy,\u201d Ekaterina Schulmann, a political scientist in Moscow, says. \u201cThe more it tries to seem young and energetic, the more it obviously fails.\u201d As Aleksey Chesnakov, a former Kremlin insider, told me, in Russia \u201cthe most active voters\u201d\u2014the people who buy in most fully to what Putin\u2019s selling\u2014\u201care the pensioners.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"dropcap\"><span class=\"caps\">T<\/span><span class=\"smallcaps\">o putin\u2019s supporters<\/span>, his regime isn\u2019t an autocracy, exactly. \u201cIt can be described as <i>demophilia<\/i>,\u201d Migranyan explained. \u201cIt is not a democracy, but it is in the name of the people, and for the people. Putin\u2019s main constituency is the people. All of his power comes from his rating with the people, and therefore it\u2019s important that he gives them the fruits of his rule.\u201d The Kremlin calls it \u201cmanaged democracy.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-25\">This, too, is crucial to understanding why Putin acts as he does, and how he is likely to think about new campaigns against the United States. The Kremlin\u2019s direction of the press, the close eye it keeps on polls and approval numbers, and especially its foreign policy\u2014they all exist to buttress Putin\u2019s legitimacy, to curry favor with his 144 million subjects. It\u2019s a complicated, hiccuping feedback loop designed to guarantee that Putin\u2019s authoritarian rule remains popular and unthreatened.<\/p>\n<p>This is why Putin insists on having elections, even if the result is always predictable. \u201cWithout renewing the mandate, the system can\u2019t survive,\u201d Chesnakov said. \u201cAccording to polls, two-thirds of Russians don\u2019t want a monarchy. They want a democracy. But they have a different sense of it than Americans and Europeans.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Putin\u2019s third presidential term is up in the spring of 2018. He didn\u2019t bother to declare that he\u2019d run for reelection until December 6 (the election is in March) and he likely won\u2019t campaign.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/magazine\/archive\/2018\/01\/putins-game\/546548\/#Correx\" data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'11',r'546548'\">*<\/a><a id=\"Text\" name=\"Text\" data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'12',r'546548'\"><\/a> This is Putin\u2019s carefully cultivated image at home: the phlegmatic leader who hovers coolly above the fray as it churns on beneath him. But in the past year or so, the fray has given him reason to worry.<\/p>\n<p>On a chilly afternoon this spring, I watched college students standing on the steps of a nondescript building off Volgograd\u2019s central square, waiting to meet with Alexey Navalny. The opposition leader and anti-corruption crusader has captured the imagination of many young Russians, as well as that of Westerners who see him as a potential rival of, or even replacement for, Putin. Navalny has declared that he is running for president in the upcoming election.<\/p>\n<p>Police had blocked off the street in front of the building, which housed Navalny\u2019s local campaign office. They stood groggily watching as Cossacks, members of a southern Russian tribe who have historically acted as the state\u2019s vigilante enforcers, strolled up and down the block, casually swinging their black-leather whips. Angry-looking young men in track pants and sneakers\u2014the other fists-for-hire preferred by the Kremlin\u2014paced around the students, eyeing them menacingly. Young women in vertiginous heels\u2014plainclothes cops\u2014milled around. Every few minutes, they took out identical camcorders tagged with numbered yellow stickers and filmed the students standing on the steps, zooming in on their faces.<\/p>\n<p>Navalny had recently been attacked by progovernment thugs who splashed \u201cBrilliant Green,\u201d a Soviet-era antiseptic, on his face. His supporters subsequently posted an image of <i>The Motherland Calls<\/i>, the giant statue commemorating the Soviet victory at Stalingrad, with its face Photoshopped green, to publicize his rally in Volgograd. The image touched a nerve in a country where the government fetishizes World War II. Within hours, pro-Kremlin social-media accounts were using the image to fuel local outrage. By the time Navalny arrived in Volgograd, from Moscow, the youth wing of Putin\u2019s party was waiting with a protest.<\/p>\n<p>The students standing on the steps of the campaign office found the manufactured outrage funny. They were at an age when most things were funny, even when the state was clearly watching them. The FSB had recently sent a summons to the home of Vlad, a fourth-year student at Volgograd State University who had previously picketed in support of Navalny\u2019s Progress Party. Roman, a bespectacled third-year student in veterinary science, had been called into the dean\u2019s office for participating in a protest. \u201cThe dean said, \u2018Don\u2019t go to Navalny\u2019s protests. His political position is wrong,\u2019\u2009\u201d Roman told me, shrugging and shoving his hands into the pockets of his puffy red jacket.<\/p>\n<p>These young men would soon graduate into an economy that had only recently started to grow again after a five-year malaise. But the growth is barely perceptible, while prices for basic goods have soared. Some of their neighbors and family acquaintances hadn\u2019t been paid in months, they said. \u201cOur parents say things have gotten worse,\u201d Roman told me. But their parents also knew the potential cost of openly opposing the government, and weren\u2019t happy that their sons were at the rally that day. They also believed, from watching state TV, that Navalny was an American agent.<\/p>\n<p>The young men laughed at this, too. Navalny had begun to build his base about a decade earlier, with a blog on LiveJournal that carefully documented how government officials supposedly carved thick slices off the state budget and stashed the money in Moscow mansions or real estate abroad. A few years ago, Navalny launched a YouTube channel where he posts slickly produced videos describing alleged government corruption schemes. On another YouTube channel, Navalny Live, he and his team at the Anti-Corruption Foundation host talk shows about politics, the kind of programming that would never be allowed on state-controlled television. Together, the channels have more than 1.5 million subscribers, and the videos have collected hundreds of millions of views.<\/p>\n<p>As the students and I stood chatting, a retinue of preschoolers marched past the office with their teachers. The college students broke into laughter and cheers. \u201cEveryone says that Navalny\u2019s supporters are really young, but I didn\u2019t know they were this young!,\u201d Roman said.<\/p>\n<p>But things quickly lost their comic lightness when a young man in track pants started loudly arguing with an older Navalny supporter, saying Navalny was funded by the U.S. State Department and noting the personal offense he took at the green-faced <i>Motherland Calls<\/i> statue. \u201cIt\u2019s a monument to a great victory!\u201d his friend, another angry young man in track pants, screamed. \u201cIt was built on bones! My grandfather fought for Stalingrad!\u201d (His grandfather, he later admitted to me, had been born in Georgia in 1941.)<\/p>\n<p>Suddenly, scores of anti-Navalny protesters appeared, some with brooms, as if preparing to sweep him out of their city. \u201cNavalny, come out!\u201d a middle-aged man with a shaved head screamed into a megaphone as the protesters surged across the sidewalk toward the campaign office. \u201cNavalny, come out!\u201d they yelled in response. The college students packed in tightly on the campaign office\u2019s front steps, ready to defend their leader. The two camps started pushing and shoving, the crowd swaying violently. The cops watched. I looked up and saw Roman\u2019s red jacket. He had taken off his glasses and stood on the top step, blinking and squinting into the noise. The swagger and irony had gone off his face. He looked vulnerable, like a child.<\/p>\n<p>Navalny emerged at the top of the steps, calm as ever. Part of the crowd started chanting, \u201cShame! Shame! Shame!\u201d Navalny invited the man with the megaphone and his comrades up the steps to talk with him calmly, face-to-face. They came up and grabbed him by the legs and started to drag him toward the hostile part of the crowd. Finally the cops acted, freeing Navalny and pushing the crowd back toward the street.<\/p>\n<p>Navalny escaped into his campaign office, where, for the next three hours, he fielded questions in a room so packed with supporters that his hair was soon dripping with sweat. He spoke about the contrast between government elites\u2019 luxurious lifestyles and the region\u2019s sagging wages; about rising utility fees, despite falling energy prices; about the pitiful state of the roads.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAlexey!\u201d one of his supporters yelled out. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left in our city since 1945 except the victory!\u201d Everyone clapped.<\/p>\n<p>Navalny laughed at the state\u2019s accusations that his supporters\u2014the hundreds of people sweating with him in the room\u2014had been paid by the U.S. State Department to show up. \u201cThis is the real political force of the country,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we will win. We are destined for victory, because in any culture, in any civilization, people like us win, because <i>they<\/i> lie and <i>we<\/i> tell the truth.\u201d<picture><\/picture>\n<p>I wiped clear a small rectangle on a fogged-up window. There was nothing left of the angry crowd, not even the police. They had vanished as quickly as they had materialized.<\/p>\n<p>Two days later, on March 26, Navalny rushed back to Moscow, where thousands of people had heeded his call to come out and protest state corruption. Tens of thousands more came out in nearly 100 other Russian cities and towns, across Russia\u2019s 11 time zones\u2014an unexpected showing that grabbed international headlines. Earlier that month, Navalny had posted an hour-long expos\u00e9 on YouTube about the extensive luxury-real-estate holdings of the prime minister and former president, Dmitry Medvedev\u2014who in 2008 had lamented that a sum equivalent to a third of the Russian federal budget had disappeared to corruption. Navalny contrasted the opulence of Medvedev\u2019s many homes, filmed by drones, with his awkward call for austerity to the residents of Crimea, who, on joining Russia, had lost access to a steady supply of water, electricity, and reasonably priced food. \u201cThere\u2019s no money,\u201d Medvedev advised them two years after the annexation, in 2016, \u201cbut you hang in there.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>By the time of the mass protests, the expos\u00e9 had been watched almost 12 million times. A couple of schoolboys climbed up on a lamppost in Moscow\u2019s iconic Pushkin Square, packed with protesters, and called to the cops trying to get them down, \u201cThere\u2019s no money, but we\u2019re hanging in there!\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"dropcap\"><span class=\"caps\">I<\/span><span class=\"smallcaps\">n recent years,<\/span> as the economy has struggled, Putin has purchased his popularity with a series of tactical measures. Putin pays extremely close attention to his approval ratings to see what works and what doesn\u2019t. He and his advisers are addicted to polls. According to Alexander Oslon, who runs the Public Opinion Foundation, which does polling for the Kremlin, \u201cThey can\u2019t live without them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Putin\u2019s approval rating surged in 2014 with the annexation of Crimea\u2014and, by extension, Russia\u2019s return to imperial grandeur. It was a risky maneuver, the equal, perhaps, of Putin\u2019s later interference in the U.S. election. And it paid off, at least in the short term. Russians rallied behind the Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine\u2014and behind Putin, their audacious president. \u201cThere was a spike in loyalty\u201d toward \u201cevery organ of the state,\u201d Kirill Rogov, a political analyst in Moscow who studies Russian polling, told me\u2014\u201ca conservative shift in all directions. People started paying more attention to the news, they watched more TV, and they became more indoctrinated.\u201d For a decade, a majority of Russians had told pollsters that they would rather be well-off than live in a great power. In 2014, those preferences flipped.<\/p>\n<p>But the rush of patriotism provided by the Crimean annexation proved fleeting. Connected by land only to Ukraine, Crimea is hard to supply from Russia. The peninsula is facing severe water shortages in its near future, and tourism, a mainstay of the local economy, has plummeted. On a recent trip there, I was told by even the most ardently pro-Russia locals, Cossacks who had staged protests supporting Moscow in 2014, that they had come to regret their stance. The violent lawlessness and corruption of Moscow had reached their home, and life had become much harder as Russian citizens. In some ways, they missed being Ukrainian.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the already sluggish Russian economy has lost cheap Western financing, following the imposition of American and European sanctions. Putin\u2019s response to those sanctions\u2014banning food imports from the United States and the EU\u2014made food prices climb by double-digit percentages. The economy sank into recession. By the beginning of 2017, the government\u2019s approval numbers had nearly returned to pre-annexation levels.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\u201cIt\u2019s the brand of the year,\u201d Minin said of Russia\u2019s hackers. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing when, aside from oil, we have cutting-edge specialists\u201d whom the whole world talks about.<\/span><\/aside>\n<p>Russia\u2019s intervention in Syria, which began in the fall of 2015, offered another flag-wrapped distraction. As America shrank from its traditional role in the Middle East, Russia expanded its own, making an ostentatious show of fighting Islamist terrorists on behalf of a reluctant Western Christendom. Shortly after the Syrian army, aided by Russian airpower and commandos, retook the ancient city of Palmyra from the Islamic State, the Russian military flew the Mariinsky Orchestra in from St. Petersburg for a concert in front of the city\u2019s historic ruins\u2014and a dozen press cameras. (Russian TV barely covered the loss of the city by Russian-backed forces to <span class=\"smallcaps\">isis<\/span> half a year later.)<\/p>\n<p>There will inevitably be a reckoning for the Syrian adventure, too. For the entirety of his reign, Putin has struggled to contain an Islamist insurgency in Russia\u2019s North Caucasus mountains, from which terrorists have launched attacks on Moscow. But on a trip this spring to Dagestan, a mostly Muslim enclave in the heart of the mountains, I found that the region, once extremely violent, was peaceful. Worried about potential terror attacks in nearby Sochi during the 2014 Olympics, the Russian secret services had allowed hundreds, if not thousands, of Islamist rebels, all of them Russian citizens, to go to Syria. According to one report in <i>Novaya Gazeta<\/i>, the FSB even provided some of them with a passport and transportation to the Russian border.<\/p>\n<p>It was a shortsighted counterterrorism strategy. Two Dagestani men who traveled to <span class=\"smallcaps\">isis<\/span>-controlled territories in Syria in order to bring back their children told me that they heard as much Russian as Arabic on the streets of <span class=\"smallcaps\">isis<\/span> cities. An October report by the Soufan Center, a security-intelligence nonprofit, showed that more foreign fighters in Iraq and Syria came from Russia than from any other country. What will become of these Russian fighters, now better trained and battle-hardened, as <span class=\"smallcaps\">isis<\/span> territory continues to shrink? Some 400 have already returned to Russia, according to the Soufan Center report, but even those who don\u2019t return home can wreak havoc: In April, a suicide bomber blew himself up at a St. Petersburg metro station, killing 13 people. Russian speakers outside the country who had joined <span class=\"smallcaps\">isis <\/span>were suspected of having radicalized him.<\/p>\n<p>Russia\u2019s interference in the U.S. election was just as shortsighted. At first, Donald Trump\u2019s victory seemed to be a great coup for Putin. Kremlin loyalists celebrated Trump\u2019s inauguration in Moscow, including at a live watch party with free-flowing champagne. And it conferred on Russia prestige of a sort. When I asked Victor Minin, the former Russian-government cybersecurity specialist who runs hackathons across Russia, about the effect of American media coverage of Russian hackers, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s the brand of the year. It\u2019s a good thing when, aside from oil, we have cutting-edge specialists and the whole world is talking about them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But this victory has burned out even faster than the others. The fingerprints that the Russians left behind, once discovered, raised an uproar in Washington. Congress, in a rare near-unanimous vote, stripped Trump of the ability to unilaterally lift American sanctions on Russia. They will very likely remain in place indefinitely, a prospect Medvedev bemoaned in a Facebook post the day Trump reluctantly signed the bill into law. Unable to get back the two diplomatic compounds in the U.S. that had been seized during the last days of the Obama administration, the Russians plunged headfirst into a destructive tit for tat\u2014which resulted in the seizure of three more Russian diplomatic posts.<\/p>\n<p>Ironically, one of the Russian institutions to suffer the most blowback for the Russian hack is the FSB, one of the agencies believed to be behind the 2016 interference. \u201cBefore 2016, the FSB had a good reputation in Washington,\u201d Andrei Soldatov, the Russian journalist, told me. The head of the FSB \u201cwas considered a reliable partner in fighting terrorism.\u201d But \u201cit all ended in 2016, and it ended very badly.\u201d FSB officers were put on the FBI\u2019s most-wanted list for cybercriminals, an unprecedented retaliation. The head of the FSB\u2019s elite cyber unit and his deputy were forced out; two other top officers from the unit ended up in Moscow\u2019s most notorious jail. \u201cThey\u2019re now under incredible pressure both from the inside and the outside,\u201d Soldatov said. \u201cSometimes,\u201d says Michael Hayden, a director of the National Security Agency under George W. Bush, \u201cyou have successful covert operations that you wish hadn\u2019t succeeded.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Meddling in the U.S. election might have destabilized the American political system, but it is unclear how carefully Putin considered the potential consequences for his country. His goal is to stay in power another day, another year, and to deal with complications when\u2014and if\u2014they arise.<\/p>\n<p class=\"dropcap\"><span class=\"caps\">T<\/span><span class=\"smallcaps\">he protests sparked by navalny<\/span> are a complication that has, for now, been dealt with. Police arrested 1,043 people on March 26 in Moscow alone. On October 7, following another, smaller round of protests, they arrested hundreds more. Navalny will not be allowed on the election ballot, according to various reports and one Kremlin insider I spoke with; a recent court finding against him following trumped-up charges of embezzlement will most likely be used to disqualify him.<\/p>\n<p>These were hardly the first protests that Putin has weathered. Massive prodemocracy, anti-Putin demonstrations rocked Moscow in the winter of 2011\u201312\u2014and were followed by a violent police crackdown on May 6, 2012, the day before Putin was sworn in for a third time. Dozens of people, some of them first-time protesters, were given multiyear prison sentences. The Kremlin soon raised the penalties for participating in any kind of unsanctioned protest. Several people are now in jail simply for sharing or liking posts on social media.<\/p>\n<p>Olga Romanova, who founded the NGO Russia Behind Bars to provide Russians with legal assistance, told me that the lesson the government is preparing for this new batch of young protesters \u201cwill be bigger and harsher\u201d than the one in 2012, and that \u201cit will last years.\u201d She said the state was threatening to separate protesting minors from their parents. The feared Investigative Committee \u201cis calling in school principals, school psychologists, teachers for questioning,\u201d Romanova said. \u201cAnd they testify against the kids.\u201d (This summer, under pressure from the Russian government, Romanova fled to Western Europe.)<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-26\">Having declared his candidacy, Putin will almost certainly win another six-year term. Instead of Navalny, the television celebrity Ksenia Sobchak, a daughter of the man who helped launch Putin\u2019s political career, will run against him\u2014acting, it is commonly believed, as a Kremlin-approved steam valve for the liberal opposition. The oligarch Mikhail Prokhorov, the majority owner of the Brooklyn Nets, is thought to have played this role in 2012. (Both Sobchak and Prokhorov have denied any Kremlin involvement in their campaigns.) In reality, Putin will run essentially unopposed. Other dummy candidates will likely include old men from the \u201cloyal opposition\u201d parties that are on the Kremlin\u2019s payroll. Protests notwithstanding, Putin is still broadly popular, especially among older Russians, and the election, in any case, will be engineered to deliver the right result.<\/p>\n<p>In 2012, when Putin ran for his third term amid protests, the Kremlin put out the message that the system had to deliver at least 50 percent of the vote to Putin to prevent an embarrassing runoff. But as that target moved down through the giant Russian bureaucracy, each layer added a little extra padding, to avoid the wrath of supervisors. The electoral machinery employed various tricks\u2014manipulating voter rolls, stuffing ballot boxes, driving busloads of supporters around to vote at multiple precincts. All the padding added up. On election night, Putin stood on a stage with the Kremlin behind him and tears gleaming on his cheeks: The people had resisted the Western-backed protesters and delivered him a resounding win\u201464 percent of the vote.<\/p>\n<p>But the margin of that win must now be exceeded, and given that election fraud was the issue that initially catalyzed the protests in 2011\u201312, the Kremlin has been trying to perform a tricky balancing act: delivering the right result while making the election look fair. On Christmas Eve 2016, at a gathering of deputy governors in Moscow, the Kremlin laid out its election strategy for 2018, which it called \u201c70\/70.\u201d The goal was a 70 percent turnout, with 70 percent of the vote to Putin. Without overt fraud, those are very hard targets to hit.<\/p>\n<p>So the Kremlin is said to be looking for the next ratings bump\u2014\u201ca rally-around-the-flag effect,\u201d said Kirill Rogov, the political analyst, \u201clike the surge in Bush\u2019s popularity after 9\/11, when, in a moment of national crisis or success, the opposition tamps down its criticism because it just won\u2019t resonate with the population.\u201d In most countries, this wave passes and the criticism reemerges. \u201cBut in Russia,\u201d Rogov said, \u201cthe rally around the flag never stops.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>IV. Double Down<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">On April 10, 2017, an assistant to Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Donald Trump\u2019s campaign for possible collusion with the Kremlin, patched in a long-planned call from Andriy Parubiy, the speaker of the Rada, the Ukrainian parliament. Parubiy said he had some potentially explosive information about Trump\u2019s visit to Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant in 2013.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>\u201cI would just caution that our Russian friends may be listening to the conversation, so I wouldn\u2019t share anything over the phone that you don\u2019t want them to hear,\u201d Schiff warned.<\/p>\n<p>But Parubiy persisted. \u201cIn November 2013, Mr. Trump visited Moscow, he visited competition Miss Universe, and there he met with Russian journalist and celebrity Ksenia Sobchak,\u201d he said in his heavily accented, awkward English. He explained that in addition to having ties to Putin, Sobchak is \u201calso known as a person who provides girls for escort for oligarchs. And she met with Trump and she brought him one Russian girl, celebrity Olga Buzova.\u201d Schiff soberly asked for clarification, and Parubiy answered directly: Sobchak, he said, is a \u201cspecial agent of Russian secret service.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Buzova \u201cgot compromising materials on Trump after their short relations,\u201d Parubiy said. \u201cThere were pictures of naked Trump.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Schiff betrayed no emotion. \u201cAnd so Putin was made aware of the availability of the compromising material?\u201d he asked.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Parubiy said. Putin wanted it communicated to Trump that \u201call those compromising materials will never be released if Trump will cancel all Russian sanctions.\u201d The biggest bombshell: He had obtained a recording of Buzova and Sobchak talking about the <i>kompromat<\/i> while the two were visiting Ukraine. He told Schiff, \u201cWe are ready to provide [those materials] to FBI.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Parubiy had more to say. He told Schiff about meetings that Trump\u2019s former national-security adviser, Michael Flynn, had had with a Russian pop singer who served as an intermediary for the Kremlin. They\u2019d met at a caf\u00e9 in Brighton Beach, a Russian-immigrant enclave in Brooklyn, where, Parubiy said, \u201cthey used a special password before their meetings.\u201d One would say, \u201cWeather is good on Deribasovskaya.\u201d The right response was \u201cIt rains again on Brighton Beach.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAll righty. Good, this is very helpful. I appreciate it,\u201d Schiff said. He told Parubiy that the U.S. would welcome the chance to review the evidence he had described. \u201cWe will try to work with the FBI to figure out, along with your staff, how we can obtain copies.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Schiff was right to be concerned about \u201cour Russian friends\u201d listening in, though not in the way he imagined. It wasn\u2019t Parubiy who\u2019d called. It was Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexey Stolyarov, two Russian pranksters known as Vovan and Lexus. There was no <i>kompromat<\/i>, no meetings between Flynn and a Russian pop star in Brighton Beach. The call made the Americans look gullible, which suited the callers. Kuznetsov and Stolyarov immediately sent the recording to Kremlin-friendly media, which gleefully made hay of it: another dumb American, ready to believe the most-ludicrous stories about a Russia run by sneaky, evil spies. Any Russian listening to the tape would have instantly recognized how silly the conversation was. There were the B-list Russian celebrities, plus other cultural signals, like the code phrase Flynn allegedly used, which is actually the title of a classic Russian comedy.<picture><\/picture>\n<p>\u201cWe wanted to talk to someone who specifically works on intelligence and give him a completely insane version of events,\u201d Kuznetsov told me of the prank.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe leaked him a bunch of disinformation,\u201d Stolyarov said. \u201cIt was completely absurd.\u201d (A spokesman for Schiff said, \u201cBefore agreeing to take the call, and immediately following it, the committee informed appropriate law-enforcement and security personnel of the conversation, and of our belief that it was probably bogus.\u201d)<\/p>\n<p>Kuznetsov and Stolyarov come off as the Jerky Boys of Russia, but they are more than that. We met at a Belgian pub in one of Moscow\u2019s bedroom communities. Kuznetsov, 31, wore a white shirt flecked with black skulls, and Stolyarov, 29, a gray hoodie with Putin\u2019s face superimposed on a map of Russia. (\u201cI see Putin positively,\u201d Stolyarov said. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything major I\u2019d disagree with him on,\u201d Kuznetsov concurred.) When the duo met, in 2014, they started pranking Russian celebrities, but quickly tired of it. \u201cIt\u2019s more interesting talking to people who decide people\u2019s fates,\u201d Kuznetsov said.<\/p>\n<p>He and Stolyarov have repeatedly denied any connection to the Russian secret services, but they clearly have cozy ties to the government. They have had shows on several Kremlin-controlled TV channels, which requires high-level approval. When I met them, they casually mentioned that they had been at the Russian Parliament the day before, meeting with a well-known elected official. \u201cWe\u2019re working on a project,\u201d Stolyarov said coyly, then bragged about having hacked the Skype account of the late Russian oligarch\u2014and Putin enemy\u2014Boris Berezovsky \u201cfor a long time.\u201d They had somehow obtained the cellphone numbers of foreign leaders such as Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.<\/p>\n<p>Kuznetsov and Stolyarov have an extensive list of American victims. In February, posing as the Ukrainian prime minister, they prank-called Senator John McCain, who confessed that the Trump era was the hardest time of his long political life. \u201cHe sounded like he didn\u2019t know what to do\u2014like, at all,\u201d Kuznetsov recalled. That same month, they prank-called Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who told them that new sanctions against Russia were unlikely.<\/p>\n<p>The point of Kuznetsov and Stolyarov\u2019s American work is both to uncover important information\u2014like what will happen regarding sanctions\u2014and to troll, distract, confuse, and ridicule people whom American voters might be inclined to respect but who are hostile to Russia. They play on what they see as American na\u00efvet\u00e9. \u201cThis would never happen in Russia,\u201d Stolyarov said. \u201cPeople wouldn\u2019t be so trusting, especially if they are a member of parliament or a civil servant.\u201d They\u2019d like to prank Hollywood actors, Kuznetsov added, but they are \u201cmuch harder to reach than American senators.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If one were to design avatars of Russia\u2019s approach to undermining the U.S.\u2014opportunistic, oblique, clownish, and shockingly effective\u2014it would be hard to do better than Vovan and Lexus. They and the future hackers trained by Minin are all small pieces of a shifting, multipronged covert-influence campaign against Western politicians, systems, and values\u2014a campaign built more on the premise of trial and error than on grand strategy. The Russians have \u201c1,000 ways to attack,\u201d a former U.S. intelligence official told me. \u201cThey don\u2019t need all of them to get through. Just a few are enough.\u201d<\/p>\n<aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\">U.S. investigations are mostly focused on what Russia did in 2016, instead of what it will inevitably do in 2018 and 2020.<\/aside>\n<p>Where the Russians have broken through, the apertures they\u2019ve exploited seem glaring in retrospect. \u201cI have been impressed over the last five weeks by how fragile our democracy is,\u201d Schiff told me not long before he was prank-called, as we sat in a cafeteria booth in the basement of the Capitol. What Russia showed in the 2016 election\u2014and what it has continued to show in the election\u2019s aftermath\u2014is not so much its own strength, but American vulnerability: that it doesn\u2019t take much to turn the American system on itself. \u201cCovert-influence operations don\u2019t create divisions on the ground; they amplify them,\u201d says Michael Hayden, the former NSA chief. John Sipher, the former CIA operative, agrees. \u201cIf there\u2019s anyone to blame, it\u2019s us,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we accept the stoking, it\u2019s our fault.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As Americans are left trying to puzzle out what exactly happened in 2016, and how they fell prey to what Hayden has called \u201cone of the most successful covert-influence campaigns in history,\u201d the campaign continues. Putin, ever the gambler, will continue to seize opportunities as they arise, and bend them to his immediate advantage. Given what\u2019s already been revealed\u2014and the extent to which Congress has tied Trump\u2019s hands on sanctions\u2014he knows that he\u2019ll see no immediate benefit from playing nice. Without meaningful new deterrence, he will continue lashing out as both he and his country age and decline.<\/p>\n<p>Some Americans, including the current president, believe that if only we could identify where our interests align, Russia could be a good partner. But those who have dealt with Putin for decades understand that this is, at best, a fantasy. \u201cPutin defines Russia\u2019s interests in opposition to\u2014and with the objective of thwarting\u2014Western policy,\u201d Ash Carter, Obama\u2019s last defense secretary, told me recently. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to build a bridge to that motivation. It makes it ipso facto impossible\u201d to \u201cwork cooperatively with Russia.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Putin is not a supervillain. He is not invincible, or unstoppable. He pushes only until the moment he meets resistance. His 2014 plans to lop off the eastern third of Ukraine, for instance, broke apart against the surprisingly fierce resistance of the Ukrainian army, and Western sanctions. Obama sanctioned the Russian government for its election interference during his last days in office, closing those Russian compounds and expelling some diplomats, but it was a belated, feeble response. More-forceful options\u2014revealing intelligence that would embarrass Putin, or introducing truly crippling new sanctions\u2014Obama decided not to use.<\/p>\n<p>The current presidential administration, meanwhile, is uninterested in punishing Russia. And the various investigations into Russian election meddling, along with the press\u2019s attention to them, are mostly focused on what happened in 2016, rather than on what Russia will inevitably do in the 2018 and 2020 elections if it is not penalized and credibly warned off future intervention. American counterintelligence forces sit idle, waiting for a directive to do battle with the Russians that insiders suspect will never come.<\/p>\n<p>Putin set out to show that there is nothing special about America, that it is just another country. Whether he is right depends in no small part on whether enough Americans\u2014especially powerful or politically connected Americans\u2014still believe their system is worth defending.<\/p>\n<p class=\"dropcap\"><span class=\"caps\">T<\/span><span class=\"smallcaps\">here is one dot<\/span> on the horizon that particularly worries the Kremlin. In 2024, Putin\u2019s next six-year presidential term will be up. The constitution limits Putin to two consecutive terms, and he will be 71 years old. \u201cAll these guys are thinking about 2024,\u201d said the businessman high up in United Russia, Putin\u2019s party. The parliament could change the constitution to allow Putin to serve yet another term. But that\u2019s not ideal. Putin, who trained as a lawyer before he was a KGB agent, has insisted on maintaining a simulacrum of legality. And anyway, he, a mortal man, can serve only so many terms.<\/p>\n<p>So what is Putin to do? Will he hand off his throne to a successor? There are ever fewer candidates. His circle of advisers has shrunk; now it\u2019s made up mostly of old men who, like him, came from Leningrad or served in the KGB. In recent years, he has replaced regional governors with young loyalists and even former bodyguards\u2014most of whom have no significant governing experience but owe everything to him. More and more, he appears to be a man without an exit strategy. As one Putin ally told me in 2013, \u201cWe don\u2019t have this tradition of, okay, you served two terms and you leave. We have no other tradition but to hold out to the end and leave feetfirst\u201d\u2014that is, in a coffin.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-27\">In 2014, Vyacheslav Volodin, now the speaker of the Russian Parliament, said, \u201cIf there is Putin, there is Russia. If there is no Putin, there is no Russia.\u201d Putin has personalized the institutions of the state\u2014the courts, the army, the security forces, the parliament, even the opposition parties\u2014and the economy, too. As the economic pie gets smaller, the elites are cannibalizing one another in the struggle over whatever resources remain, and can be squeezed out of the population. The people now filling Russia\u2019s most notorious jails are elite government officials: countless bureaucrats, at least four governors, and numerous mayors. A minister is under house arrest. They are the losers in an increasingly savage fight. The winners are typically those who spin in the orbit closest to Putin\u2019s dying star.<\/p>\n<p>Ironically, Putin has laid the groundwork for exactly the kind of chaotic collapse that he has spent his political life trying to avoid, the kind of collapse that gave rise to his reign. He has made himself a hostage to a system he built with his own hands. \u201cThe lack of alternatives worries everyone, including Putin,\u201d Andranik Migranyan said. He said that in 2012, Putin told him, \u201cI often have to spend time on <i>ruchnoe upravlenie<\/i>\u201d\u2014Russian for a car\u2019s manual transmission and a term that has come to signify micromanagement. \u201cI would love to leave if I felt like I did enough work to make institutions work independently of the next leader.\u201d<\/p>\n<aside class=\"callout\" data-omni-click=\"r'article',r' ',d,r'related',#data-omni-index,@data-article-id\"><\/aside>\n<p>But of course, the longer Putin spends using the stick shift, the less likely the gears will catch on their own, without his strong hand to guide them into place. \u201cIt\u2019s the dictator\u2019s dilemma,\u201d says one of Washington\u2019s veteran Russia-watchers. \u201cThe only way to take away risk is you can\u2019t leave. And you can\u2019t reform, because that leads to cracks in the system that lead to your overthrow.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Putin has been kicking the can down the road for a long time, and this has generally worked for him. He is still popular and still in good shape, as his shows of bare-chested masculinity are meant to remind us. But there is less road left every day, and one day, it will run out. Everyone in Moscow knows that day is coming, but no one knows what happens the day after. \u201cIf he suddenly leaves in 2024, we will be orphaned,\u201d says Konstantin Malofeev, an oligarch who was sanctioned by the West for supporting pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine (which he has denied doing). He believes that Putin was chosen by God to lead Russia. The next person, he fears, won\u2019t have the same sense of duty. \u201cThe next person,\u201d he says, \u201cwill be worse.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Russia&#8217;s strongman president has many Americans convinced of his manipulative genius.
