It is the eleventh largest country in Africa and is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, Morocco and the remnants of Western Sahara in the north, Algeria in the northeast, Mali in the east and southeast, and Senegal in the southwest.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The country derives its name from the ancient Berber Kingdom of Mauritania, which existed from the 3rd century BC to the 7th century, in the far north of modern-day Morocco. Approximately 90% of Mauritania&#8217;s land is within the Sahara and consequently, the population is concentrated in the south, where precipitation is slightly higher. The capital and largest city is Nouakchott, located on the Atlantic coast, and home to around one-third of the country&#8217;s 3.5 million people.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">About 20% of Mauritanians live on less than US$1.25 per day. Mauritania suffers from several human rights issues, including slavery, where an estimated roughly 4% (155,600 people) of the country&#8217;s population are being enslaved against their will, especially enemies of the government.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Official Name.<\/strong> Islamic Republic of Mauritania.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Capital.<\/strong> Nouakchott. 18\u00b009\u2019N 15\u00b058\u2019W<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Languages<\/strong>. The official language of Mauritania is Modern Standard Arabic. However, the Hassaniya dialect of Arabic is the language of the Moor majority, while other languages are spoken by Southern Black Africans including Pulaar, Wolof, and Soninke (especially in the Guidimakha region around Selibaby). French is spoken by many especially near towns.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It is considered polite to say Salaam Aleikum when entering a taxi, office or when greeting someone. It is the first greeting for most of the dialects spoken in the region.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Area.<\/strong> 1,030,000 sq. km (397,685 sq. mi)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Population.<\/strong> 2015 estimate 4,067,564. 2013 census 3,537,368.

Exchange rates in September 2016 were 1\u20ac = 400 MRO; 1US$ = 357 MRO. It is one of two circulating currencies, along with the Malagasy ariary, whose division units are not based on a power of ten.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Credit cards are accepted almost anywhere. It is easy to change euros, dollars and francs CFA in Nouakchott.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>VISAS.<\/strong> Nationals of Algeria, C\u00f4te d&#8217;Ivoire, the Gambia, Libya, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Syria and Tunisia do not need a visa. Holders of passports issued by any country can obtain a visa on arrival at Nouakchott International Airport. For tourist purposes, a letter of invitation is not needed<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Visas are no longer available on arrival at land borders, so overland travellers have to arrange them in Rabat, Morocco, Dakar, Senegal or Banjul, Gambia. The single entry visa fee is 62.5 EUR, and double entry is 125 EUR. Two passport-size photos are required, as well as a copy of the information pages of your passport. Visas are available on the next day for people of most nationalities, including Americans.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">For most people, there are no vaccinations required in Mauritania. Only ones coming from yellow fever endemic zones are required to present a vaccination certificate.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>Visas for Onward Travel<\/em>. We obtained the Democratic Republic of Congo visa here. It was difficult to obtain in Ghana, so Steve gave it a try even though we were not anticipated to arrive until March 5 at the earliest. They were able to issue a 1 month visa that expires on March 12, due to huge confusion and misunderstandings. The earliest we will arrive is March 5.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Travel insurance.<\/strong> The Canadian government\u2019s travel advisory stated \u201cavoid non-essential travel\u201d. I phoned my travel insurance company who reassured me that I was covered for all countries in the world except the USA..<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Visa.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>MAURITANIAN BORDER<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">After a 1\u00bdhr drive, we arrived in the line-up behind about 10 large trucks. This was lucky \u2013 last time there were 100 trucks in front and getting through the Moroccan side required all day (they were forced to camp at the border). We were moved ahead of several trucks and we walked through the border, attended the first office and got our exit stamp. We then went to a second office where some info was handwritten down. Meanwhile, the truck was X-rayed and the whole process required only 1\u00bd hrs. We had crossed into Mauritania.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">We then crossed the 3km \u201cno-man land\u201d. Previously there was no road (now there was 200m) so again there was no road just a track through the desert.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">At the actual Mauritanian border, we handed over all the passports, he asked if we had any alcohol, we all disembarked and a dog went through the back of the truck. He was starved for attention and mobbed the passengers to be petted.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Then it was a stop at the immigration office where our passports were scanned and our index fingers&#8217; fingerprints. It took about 4 hours to complete the whole process.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The border was a real shithole: garbage (thousands of plastic bottles), tiny travel trailers, and broken pavement. Most of us changed all our Dirhams or euros into? (1Dh = 35) and bought SIM cards. Steve had to pay a 10\u20ac \u201cprocessing fee\u201d. Everyone was very pleasant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>THE ATLANTIC COAST<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">No tacky resorts. No pollution. This coastline is a rapturous place for tranquillity seekers and nature lovers.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Parc National du Banc d\u2019Arguin. This World Heritage-listed park occupies most of the Atlantic coast in northern Mauritania. It is an important stopover and breeding ground for multitudes of birds migrating between Europe and southern Africa, and as a result, is one of the best birdwatching sites on the entire continent. It extends 200km north of Cape Timiris (155km north of Nouakchott) and 235km south of Nou\u00e2dhibou. The ideal way to approach the birds is by a traditional fishing boat, best organized from the fishing village of Iwik.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Inside the park, there are official campsites that are equipped with traditional tents. Meals can also be ordered. There\u2019s no public transport, so you\u2019ll need to hire a 4WD with a knowledgeable driver, either in Nouakchott or in Nou\u00e2dhibou, allowing a couple of days for the trip. Permits are issued either at the entrance gates or in Nou\u00e2dhibou at the park office.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>NOU\u00c3DHIBOU<\/strong> (pop 80,000)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">With the new tar road connecting the Moroccan border to Nouakchott, the fishing port of Nou\u00e2dhibou has lost much of its raison d\u2019\u00eatre for travellers, who prefer to dash to the capital or to the Adrar region. It\u2019s a good base, though, if you plan to visit Banc d\u2019Arguin. The setting is also appealing: Nou\u00e2dhibou is on the Baie du L\u00e9vrier, in the middle of a narrow 35km-long peninsula.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">After two nights in Nou\u00e2bhidou, we left at 5:30 am to try to get to Nouakchot in one day. Although it is only 400 km, it normally takes almost 12 hours, primarily because of the 15 police checks. We ate bread, jam, and peanut butter (not an uncommon breakfast) on the truck and by leaving so early, missed 5 checkpoints because they were still in bed.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Prior to two years ago, there was no direct road here. The truck was loaded on a flatbed on the iron ore train and taken to Cho\u016bm and then driven via At\u0101r and then the 6 hours to Nouakchott. Sometimes a \u201cbeach\u201d route was taken but this was fraught with problems. Huge salt flats are never-ending mud. The new road travels inland avoiding the flats.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The desert is very much like the Atacama \u2013 sand and small pebbly rock, very sparse vegetation and dead flat for miles. Occasionally small dunes formed and trees like<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">acacias appeared. As the highway returned to near the ocean, we went through a town of small shanties lining both sides of the road. Desperately poor, all were black. Fish hung drying from racks. Herds of goats and camels wandered around.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Possibly half the population of Nou\u00e1dhibou is light-skinned Moors and half is black. There is an obvious status and wealth disparity between the two. It has been estimated that there are 370,000 slaves in Mauritania, most in the Moorish north and they are all likely black. Although it was outlawed in the early 80\u2019s, little has changed in the slave trade. Hovels of decrepit shanties were not far off the main street. Many roofs had car parts (bumpers, body parts) on top.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I talked for some time on the street with a man from Gambia \u2013 here because the economy and work were better!! I can\u2019t imagine how bad The Gambia is. To him, slavery was the big \u201csecret\u201d. \u201cThe Moors are Africans too\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Cap Blanc<\/strong>. Has endangered Mediterranean monk seals that resemble elephant seals. There are roughly 150 seals, the last on earth. The colony is at the foot of the cliffs near the lighthouse at the southern tip of Cap Blanc. Also here is the spectacular wreck of the United Metlika, a cargo ship beached on a wide sandy beach.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">We stayed at a campsite in Nou\u00e2dhibou for two nights and went out to Cap Blanc on our second morning. The very rough road passed a wind farm \u2013 very old style with guy lines, half not working and several fallen over. The west half of the peninsula on which Nou\u00e2dhibou sits is Mauritanian, the other half Moroccan. A row of the hulks of old fishing boats littered the shore. The oil refining\/LNG? The facility looked nonfunctional. The rail line continues to a large ore loading facility a few km short of Cap Blanc.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The entrance fee was 1200UM. The museum was quite interesting \u2013 the seals once inhabited The Canary, Madeira, and Cape Verde Islands and down the coast to Senegal but now are mainly here and in the Madeira Islands. This is a particularly rich bit of ocean because of the upwelling of cold water. We saw one bull out in the water. Huge surf broke along the cape with steep undercuts on the white cliffs down to the rocks. Many walked down to the large beach on the SE. Little remains of the once giant ship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><b>BANC d&#8217;ARGUIN NATIONAL PARK <\/b>of\u00a0Bay of Arguin lies on the west coast of\u00a0Mauritania\u00a0between\u00a0Nouakchott\u00a0and\u00a0Nouadhibou. It is a major site for over one million migratory\u00a0birds and breeding birds from 108 species, including flamingos, pelicans, and terns\u00a0from Northern Europe, Siberia, and Greenland. Much of the breeding is on\u00a0sand banks including the islands with a mild climate and absence of human disturbance. The surrounding waters are some of the richest fishing waters in western Africa and serve as nesting grounds for the entire western region.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Marine mammals include monk seals, and dolphins (humpback bottlenose, pilot, Risso&#8217;s whales, dolphins, common, rough-toothed).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><sup id=\"cite_ref-SeretNaylor2016_12-0\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>Ras Nouadhibou (formerly Cap Blanc) peninsula is fifty km long and up to thirteen kilometres wide. Dakhlet Nouadhibou is 43 km long and 32 km wide. 50 km southeast of Ras Nouadhibou is Arguin.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Climate. Humid, temperate climate, with minimal rain<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>NOUAKCHOTT<\/strong> (pop 1 MILLION)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">We arrived after a ten-hour drive. We stayed at Auberge Menata with camping and many guests from all over: one spoke English, and an Algerian doing work experience. We were invited to share Moroccan couscous in the garden, easily the most delicious food so far on the trip.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Barely 50 years old, Nouakchott has to be simultaneously one of Africa\u2019s strangest and most unassuming capital cities. This is urban planning nomad style: a city simply plonked down 5km from the coast as if on an overnight caravan stop and left to grow by accident. Most travellers use it as a staging post before the Adrar, Parc National Banc d\u2019Arguin or the next international border.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It was a 25km drive west along the railway tracks to Nouakchott, which is on a peninsula. The hovels we passed were tiny separate wood shacks, lots of thin white and black goats and many small pens for the goats. Goats would be the only animal able to get any sustenance from this sandy, rocky soil.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Although it\u2019s not a highlight of the country, Nouakchott is sleepily idiosyncratic and you could do worse than spend an afternoon at the gloriously frantic fish market (one of the busiest in West Africa), treat yourself to a comfy guesthouse or feast in a good restaurant. It\u2019s also laid back and amazingly safe \u2013 bliss after the rigours of the desert.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Port de P\u00eache<\/strong>. The Port de P\u00eache is Nouakchott\u2019s star attraction. Both lively and colourful, you\u2019ll see hundreds of teams of mostly Wolof and Fula men dragging in heavy fishing nets. Small boys hurry back and forth with trays of fish, which they sort, gut, fillet, and layout on large trestles to dry (that must be the old way, we didn\u2019t see any of this. The best time is in the late afternoon when the fishing boats return.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">We went down at 5 pm. There were no nets but hundreds of boats already in and more coming. They ride the surf, usually broach and stabilize the front with an anchor. Then young men wearing green rubber jackets with doughnuts on their heads wade into the surf. Fish are shovelled out of the open boats into large plastic crates and carried into the market on their heads. It must be hot, back-breaking work. Getting the boats up the beach is tortuous to watch. Each incoming wave moves the boat a foot or two. Eventually, they get the boats onto rollers (old metal cylinders). The boats are painted in wildly colourful designs and the long rows make for great photos.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Major landmarks in the centre include the <strong>Grande Mosqu\u00e9e<\/strong>, also called the Mosqu\u00e9e Saoudienne, with its slender minarets, and a 10-story hotel with a swank restaurant on the top floor. Views were the best in town. We were staying close to the Grande Mosqu\u00e9e and peered into the doors. The endless white columns were painted in stark black bas-relief patterns. Non-muslims are not allowed to enter. Probably the same French soldiers walked into the mosques with their dirty boots.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The nearby market was very rough with sandy dirt paths amid tables all selling the same stuff. After searching for an hour, I finally found some playing cards. One of the card games we are playing requires two decks.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The large <strong>Mosqu\u00e9e Marocaine<\/strong> towers over a bustling market area. It\u2019s pretty safe as long as you\u2019re vigilant and sensible with your possessions, although people can be sensitive about photography. Take a taxi to get there from the centre.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Mus\u00e9e National.<\/strong> Moderately worthwhile for anyone with an interest in Moorish culture. On the 1st level is a prehistoric gallery with archaeological exhibits while the 2nd level is taken up with more recent ethnographic displays from Moorish society. The building is labelled as the Ministry of Culture.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Nouakchott beach.<\/strong> There are two decent beaches around 5km north of the centre, Plage Pichot and Plage Sultan. Popular with the small expat community on weekends. Beware of undertows.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Julia and Tom returned from London where they had gone to get their Ghana visa. Julia was able to use her British work permit so did not have to send her passport back home to New Zealand. As a result, they had only left the trip for about 10 days and missed only a lot of desert.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">We had applied for our DRC visa on December 7, but we needed to stay around until 2pm the next day for them to get their visas. The we left for Senegal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>THE ROAD TO SENEGAL<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Parc National Diawling.<\/strong> This little known national park is a sister to the Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary in Senegal on the opposite side of the border. It has important mangroves and an acacia forest, as well as large coastal dunes. Incredibly rich in birdlife, it\u2019s well-worth a detour if you have a 4WD. Facilities are almost completely undeveloped.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">After getting our DRC visas at 2pm, we left Nouakchott heading south,, drove for a record 4 hours without a pee break and bush camped 20kms north of the Senegal border. We passed through desert with heavy low bush then reached the actual Sahal with sand and acacia trees. Small villages with square flat-roofed homes were almost continuous along the highway. Some buildings had peaked roofs and symbolic wood structures on the roof. The mosques were all painted in nice pastel colours. Sand dunes were encroaching the villages.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Where we camped must have been lovely and green in the wet season as the ground was covered with dry straw. Watch for tall the acacia spines. We were off at 7:30 to get to the Senegal border (the Senegal River) at Rosso. The tiny ferry could only handle two big trucks and one car at once. We waited 2 1\/2 hrs to cross then another 2 1\/2 hrs on the Senegal side to get the free visa on arrival. The original yellow fever certificate was required.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>THE ROAD TO MALI<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">We did not go this way. The Rte de l\u2019Espoir (Road to Hope) from Nouakchott to N\u00e9ma (around 1100km) is now entirely tarred, giving a smooth (if still very long) trip to the border. Check trusted security sources before travelling toward the border.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The first major town on the road to the Malian border is Kiffa (population 30,000), an important regional trading centre and crossroads. You could also break up your journey at lively Ayo\u00fbn el-Atro\u00fbs, which is a good place to spend your last ouguiyas before crossing into Mali. The tarred road ends at the town of <strong>N\u00e9ma<\/strong>, the jumping-off point for Oual\u00e2ta and where you can get your passport stamped.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><br \/>\nOUAL\u00c2TA.<\/strong> Possibly one of Mauritania\u2019s best-kept secrets, Oual\u00e2ta is another ancient Saharan town high on atmosphere and personality. Dating from 1224, it used to be the last resting point for caravans heading for Timbuktu. It\u2019s about 100km north of N\u00e9ma but is worth the grueling ride to get here.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Entering the town you\u2019ll be struck by the red mudbrick houses adorned with decorative paintings on the exterior and interior. There\u2019s a small museum and a library, which houses ancient Islamic manuscripts. There are also several rock paintings and archaeological sites in the vicinity.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There are two dirt tracks between N\u00e9ma and Oual\u00e2ta (approximately 110km). Land Rovers in N\u00e9ma around the market ply the route between the two towns (2\u00bd hours) on an infrequent basis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>EAST OF NOU\u00c2DHIBOU<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">We didn\u2019t go here but I have included it for completeness sake. There were several of us interested in exploring this area from Nou\u0101dhibou. It is the most famous tourist area in Mauritania. The train arrives at about 2 am at Cho\u016bm, gets a taxi 3 hours to Atar and organizes a 4WD to see Chinguetti (2hrs) and Ouad\u00e2ne (4hrs). Possibly both could be seen that day, staying in Atar one night and then returning to Nouakchott (six hours) and rejoining the group. Steve thought that it would be too dangerous and the logistics difficult, but guests staying at the hostel in Nouakchott said that it was fine. Leaving the trip would invalidate most people\u2019s travel insurance.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">To see everything, get off the train to see Ben Amir and stop at Terjit on the way back to Nouakchott. This would add a few days to the trip, but both sound amazing.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Iron Ore Train.<\/strong> Africa offers some pretty wild train trips, but the train ferrying iron ore from the mines at Zou\u00e9rat to Nou\u00e2dhibou might just be the wildest. One of the longest trains in the world (typically a staggering 2.3km long), when it arrives at the \u2018station\u2019 in Nou\u00e2dhibou, a decrepit building in the open desert, a seemingly endless number of ore wagons pass before the passenger carriage at the rear finally appears. The lucky ones find a place on one of the two long benches; the rest stand or sit on the floor. There are also a dozen \u2018berths\u2019 that are so worn out you can see the springs. It\u2019s brutally basic. It\u2019s also possible to clamber into the ore cars and travel for free. Impossibly dusty, it\u2019s only for the hardcore. Plastic sheets are essential to wrap your bags (and person), plus plenty of warm clothes, as the desert can get fearsomely cold at night, as well as food and drink.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The train leaves Nou\u00e2dhibou at around 2 pm to 3 pm daily. Most travellers get off at Cho\u00fbm, 12 hours later, where bush taxis wait to take passengers to At\u00e2r, three hours away.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Ben Amira.<\/strong> Big rocks don\u2019t come much more awesome than Ben Amira. Rising 633m out of the desert, it\u2019s Africa\u2019s biggest monolith, and in size is second only to Australia\u2019s Uluru (Ayers Rock). It\u2019s visible from the train between Nou\u00e2dhibou and Zou\u00e9rat, but if you have a 4WD it makes a brilliant one-night camping trip from At\u00e2r.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There are two granite monoliths. Ben Amira is the largest, with slightly smaller A\u00efsha to the west. While Ben Amira is more massively spectacular, A\u00efsha holds a delightful surprise of her own. In December 1999, a symposium of 16 international sculptors was held here to celebrate the millennium, turning many of the boulders at the base of A\u00efsha into art. The natural shapes of the rocks were reinterpreted as animals, birds, faces and abstract creations. It\u2019s a wonderful spot, all the more so for being completely unheralded by its surroundings.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The monoliths are 4km north of the train track between Nou\u00e2dibhou and Cho\u00fbm, at Km 395. The route is sand rather than gravel piste. A\u00efsha is 5km west of Ben Amira. To find the sculptures, head for the eastern side of A\u00efsha, where it appears to join a lower mound made of giant \u2018melted\u2019 rocks: the sculptures are here.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>At\u0101r<\/strong> (pop 25,000). With the grandiose Adrar on its doorstep, this secluded town in the middle of the desert is an excellent place in which to organize camel or 4WD forays into the dune fields.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The main gare routi\u00e8re, in the heart of town, is where you can get vehicles for Nouakchott (six hours) and Cho\u00fbm (three hours). Cho\u00fbm transport is timed to meet the train heading to\/from Nou\u00e2dhibou<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>The Adrar.<\/strong> The Unesco-listed Adrar is the undoubted jewel in Mauritania\u2019s crown. It\u2019s an epic Saharan country and shows the great desert in all its variety: the ancient Saharan towns of Chinguetti and Ouad\u00e2ne, mighty sand dunes that look sculpted by an artist, vast rocky plateaus, and mellow oases fringed with date palms. For desert lovers, the Adrar is a must.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Vehicles for Chinguetti (about two hours) leave once a day from near a shop a block north of Hotel Monod. Most days there is also transport to Ouad\u00e2ne (bush taxi\/4WD about four hours), leaving from a street north of the rond-point (ask for \u2018gare de Ouad\u00e2ne\u2019).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Chinguetti<\/strong> (pop 4000). One of the more attractive of the ancient caravan towns in the Sahara, Chinguetti is Unesco World Heritage listed. It was once famous for its Islamic scholars, and was the ancient capital of the Moors; some of the buildings date from the 13th century. Chinguetti butts up against Erg Warane, Mauritania\u2019s biggest stretch of dunes, and is more than enough to meet traveller\u2019s expectations of the great Saharan sand ocean.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The highlight of any visit is a wander through the labyrinthine lanes of Le Ksar (Old Town). The principal attraction is the 16th-century stone mosque (no entry to non-Muslims). Also of great interest are the five old libraries, which house the fragile-as-dust ancient Islamic manuscripts of Chinguetti.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The dunes are best seen by camel.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Ouad\u0101ne.<\/strong> Sitting on the edge of the Adrar plateau, 120km northeast of Chinguetti, Ouad\u00e2ne is one of the most enchanting semi-ghost towns of the Sahara. As you arrive across the sands or plateau from At\u00e2r or Chinguetti, the stone houses of Le Ksar al Kiali (Old Quarter) seem to tumble down the cliff. The top of the hill is dominated by the minaret of the new mosque, which is a mere 200 years old, while at the western end, at the base of the town, is the 14th-century old mosque. In between, the crumbling structures seem to have been piled up higgledy-piggledy by some giant child playing with building blocks. Like Chinguetti, Ouad\u00e2ne was a place of scholarship and is home to over 3000 manuscripts held in private libraries. Only 20 to 30 families still live in the old town.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Take the northerly Piste du Dhar Chinguetti along the plateau. In very good condition, it departs the At\u00e2r\u2013Chinguetti road 18km before Chinguetti. Transport between Ouad\u00e2ne and Chinguetti runs next to never<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Terjit<\/strong>. We\u2019ve never visited an oasis quite like Terj\u00eet. About 40km south of At\u00e2r, a streak of palm groves is hemmed in by great red cliffs. At its head, two springs tumble out of the rocks. One is hot, the other cold, and they mix to form a natural swimming pool the perfect temperature for a dip. It\u2019s simply bliss. You pay UM1000 to enter the site.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">To get here by private car, drive 40km south of At\u00e2r on the road to Nouakchott, then turn left at the checkpoint and follow a sandy track for 11km. By public transport, take anything headed towards Nouakchott and hitch a ride from the checkpoint.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mauritania Dec 4-9, 2016 Mauritania is a country in the Maghreb region of western North Africa.
