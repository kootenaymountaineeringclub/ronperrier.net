This is a popular recreation area on weekends, with many ATV\/UTV\/Dirt Bikes and other vehicles, so watch for oncoming traffic.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Drive 22km on the Munson FSR, generally good gravel, no water bars and suitable for 2WD cars. Travel time will be about 1 hour each way.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Follow the main FSR north, past Grassy Mt., and just after the 10km marker take the right fork. This will climb up and over Grassy North\/Twin Peaks\/Pot Hill (many names).\u00a0 There is a brake check just past the 14km mark which is the start of a long descent down the backside. There are many new logging roads in the area for forestry work done in the last few years.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In 2020, there was a 50-meter stretch around a steep switchback of a very rough rutted road about 16km that requires a high clearance vehicle.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In general stay on the main road and ignore the obvious spurs.\u00a0 There are two main intersections on the way down &#8211; in each case keep right and continue down, even though the alternatives look newer\/more substantial.\u00a0 Don&#8217;t miss the very first right once you start descending as the new spur straight ahead is deceptive.\u00a0 The rough section is below the second right, after which the road flattens for a few km.\u00a0 At about the 18km mark pass a large rock pile landmark and descend a short distance downhill.\u00a0 The main road continues across a creek, but before you get that far turn left and follow a side road on the west side of the creek. This will climb the last section over the ridge to the starting point.\u00a0 Continue straight up the hill and over the saddle, ignoring the new spur road that switchbacks off about halfway up.\u00a0 There is parking for 5-6 cars at the first switchback down from the saddle on the north side, 1-2 spots a little further down near the west end of the trail, and 3-4 spots at the very bottom of the hill which is the lowest point in the loop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><u>From South Slocan:<\/u> Start at Hwy 3A, cross the dam\/bridge and start on the west end of Blewett Road. Make an acute right (south) turn onto Rover Creek FSR. Drive 8.7km turn right onto Rover Creek FSR to turn past Snowwater Lodge. The road past the lodge deteriorates HC. Park at the junction 5400&#8242;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Route:<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>From the south:\u00a0<\/strong>Bushwack through light huckleberry to get off and on the ridge system but 90% of the hike is an open ridge walk\/scramble. The route follows a circular path around the main cirque of the mountain, crossing seven summits along the way that form the bowl above Glade Creek. Siwash is the third peak in the ridge.\u00a0\u00a0There is one short section of narrow rock ridge which will require a definite scramble. Long pants are advised. There is no water except at the beginning and end.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The views are great all day. There is a fair bit of elevation gain\/loss, with some steeper bits so it is a good workout. The rating for this hike is C3.\u00a0 The main hazard is being on the ridge during a thunderstorm.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Hiking time is 5-6hrs depending on group speed.\u00a0 An optional side trip descends to the Steed Hut.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Doing the ridge counterclockwise has advantages. A nice alternative to the ugly, if short, bushwhack that was at the end uses a nice fairly gentle open ridge above a cut block, which is the beginning of the hike and easier to ascend than descend. Go down a gentle ridge at the other end, rather than the boulder field, then return by a km or two along the FSR.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>From the north:<\/strong> Climb to the col and then ridge walk over 5 peaks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"CToWUd a6T\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/mail.google.com\/mail\/u\/0?ui=2&amp;ik=2b87c5c1f4&amp;attid=0.2&amp;permmsgid=msg-f:1742814933871570777&amp;th=182fb8f2d2a92f59&amp;view=fimg&amp;fur=ip&amp;sz=s0-l75-ft&amp;attbid=ANGjdJ_nTl2Rbu4AlzSpTCFbq4gbsywDn3Q6aHjCzQiyNnNt6FPasBjr5PfcDB2ZZLCR2qec8lxReqPOjK9Cpl_OMx00RZqkk1LcWbwHa_-fOCeWoLvGw1luWBEAW48&amp;disp=emb&amp;realattid=ii_l7jorvhh1\" alt=\"image.png\" width=\"547\" height=\"291\" data-image-whitelisted=\"\" data-bit=\"iit\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><em>POT HILL<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong><em>This is a nickname given to the twin peaks halfway between Grassy and Siwash.<br \/>\n<\/em><strong>Drive:<\/strong> Munson FSR 14kms.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Route:<\/strong> Short hike, little elevation gain, great views, all above tree line.
