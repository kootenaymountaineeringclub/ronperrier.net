I had arranged a 2-day car rental through Sixt and had foolishly arranged a \u201cMeet and Greet\u201d to pick up the car at the Rixo Seagate hotel. This was a bad choice as the airport was much closer to the bus station. The rental had not been confirmed despite almost 48 hours having elapsed. They were not there so I took a cab to the airport, went to Terminal 1 arrivals, couldn\u2019t enter, went to departures and then arrivals and there was no Sixt office. I googled an office in Terminal 2, went to arrivals, then departures, and found there was no office there either. I looked up the Sixt main website and an office was listed in the Rosetta Mall so took a cab there. As it turns out this downtown office had been closed for 5 years. Luckily a fellow called Avis and after a couple of hours, I finally had a car \u2013 US$77\/day with full insurance and unlimited mileage.

Some of the fishing methods, such as using dynamite and knives were also impacting on the\u00a0coral reef\u00a0and the fish populations. In 1983, the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) established the area as a marine reserve for the protection of marine and terrestrial wildlife. The park was also established to protect against\u00a0urban sprawl\u00a0from\u00a0Sharm El Sheikh\u00a0and other coastal development. The name literally means &#8220;Mohammad&#8217;s Head&#8221;, where &#8220;head&#8221; in this instance means &#8220;headland&#8221;. It is said in the area that the name arose because in side view the contour of the cliff looks like the\u00a0profile\u00a0of a bearded man&#8217;s face, with horizontal hard\u00a0strata\u00a0providing the nose and bearded\u00a0chin.<br \/>\n<em>Geography.\u00a0<\/em>The park is situated in the tourist region of the\u00a0Red Sea Riviera, located 12\u00a0km from the city of\u00a0Sharm El Sheikh. The park spans an area of 480\u00a0km2, including 135\u00a0km2\u00a0of surface land area and 345\u00a0km2\u00a0area over water.\u00a0Marsa Bareika is a small bay inlet in Ras Mohammed, and Marsa Ghozlani is a very small inlet located across from the park visitors center.<br \/>\nRas Mohammad encompasses two islands,\u00a0Tiran\u00a0and\u00a0Sanafir. Tiran Island is located approximately 6\u00a0km offshore from the Sinai Peninsula.\u00a0Underwater caves formed as the result of\u00a0earthquakes\u00a0are located in Ras Mohammad.<br \/>\nAbout 0.9 hectares of mangrove forest covers a 1.16 km shallow channel at the southernmost end of the Ras Mohammad peninsula. Near the mangrove and approximately 150 m inland, there are open cracks in the land, caused by earthquakes. One of the cracks is approximately 40 m in length and 0.20\u22121.5 m in width. Within the cracks, there are pools of water, some with a depth of over 14 m.<br \/>\nThe inland area includes a diversity of\u00a0desert\u00a0habitats\u00a0such as mountains and\u00a0wadis, gravel and coastal mud plains, and sand dunes. The area also plays a role in\u00a0bird migration, serving as a place of rest and nourishment.<br \/>\n<em>Climate.\u00a0<\/em>Ras Mohammad National Park experiences a very dry climate, with only minimal rainfall during the winter. During the summer, temperatures often exceed 40\u00a0\u00b0C and low temperatures around 27\u00a0\u00b0C (81\u00a0\u00b0F). Temperatures are mild during the winter, with daytime high temperatures averaging around 23\u00a0\u00b0C and low temperatures 14\u00a0\u00b0C (56\u00a0\u00b0F).<br \/>\n<em>Ecology. <\/em>Coral reefs, of the fringing and hermatypic types, exist along the coast close to the shoreline. More than 220 species of coral are found in the Ras Mohammad area, 125 of them soft coral. The coral reefs are located 50 to 100 cm below the sea surface, and they have a width of 30 to 50 m in most places. However in some spots on the western coast, the coral reef is 8 to 9 km wide. Shark Reef and Yolanda Reef are popular areas of coral reef in the park for divers. Other coral reef sites include South Bereika, Marsa Ghozlani, Old Quay, and Shark Observatory. The wreckage of the SS Thistlegorm, located off the coast of Ras Mohammad, is a popular area for divers.<br \/>\nThe area is home to more than 1,000 species of fish, 40 species of\u00a0starfish, 25 species of\u00a0sea urchins, more than 100 species of\u00a0mollusk,\u00a0and 150 species of\u00a0crustaceans. Among others,\u00a0sea turtles, such as the\u00a0green turtle\u00a0and the\u00a0hawksbill turtle\u00a0appear regularly in Ras Mohammad.<br \/>\nThere are acacia trees and dum palms around the wadi mouths and ephemeral herbs and grasses.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rutho Monastery<\/strong> (01\/11\/1994) (Raitho Monastery).

It belongs to the Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem. The &#8220;Martyrs of Raithu&#8221; were 43 anchorites (early Christian hermits) murdered by Bedouins (desert dwellers) during the reign of Emperor Diocletian (284-305CE). Christian monks fleeing persecution had been present since the 3rd century, and the Raithu monastery (or Rutho) was commissioned in the 6th century by Byzantine emperor Justinian. The latter was proposed as a UNESCO World Heritage site on November 1, 1994, in the Cultural category.<br \/>\nThe monastery contains two basilica churches, oil press, well provisions stores, kitchens, rooms of monks, a number of ovens for bread and food, and is surrounded by a strong wall with two entrances.

The troops were able to disembark and the defenders came out to the shore but were pushed to the city not managing to close the city doors. As the city fell, the Portuguese were ready to loot, but two Priests came to the Commander and appealed to him to avoid the destruction.<\/p>\n<p><em>At 7 pm, I was too tired to drive so pulled into a \u201crest area\u201d and slept.<br \/>\n<\/em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Day 13<\/span><em><br \/>\nUp at 5 am, I drove to Suez on a 6-lane divided highway (with virtually no traffic) averaging over 140km\/hour.

I eventually found the North Suez tunnel (20 LE) and crossed the canal \u2013 which you never get a good look at (except for some giant container ships seen over walls). The turn south to Suez City was closed and Google Maps directed me to a long, circuitous route into the city that took 2 hours instead of 25 minutes.

The monastery is named after\u00a0Catherine of Alexandria.<br \/>\nThe monastery is controlled by the autonomous\u00a0Church of Sinai, part of the wider\u00a0Greek Orthodox Church, and became a\u00a0UNESCO\u00a0World Heritage Site\u00a0in 2002 for its unique importance in the traditions of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism.<br \/>\nThe Saint Catherine monastery is located in the shadow of a group of three mountains;\u00a0Ras Sufsafeh\u00a0(possibly &#8220;Mount Horeb&#8221; c.1\u00a0km west), Jebel Arrenziyeb, and\u00a0Jebel Musa, the &#8220;Biblical Mount Sinai&#8221; (peak c.2\u00a0km south).<br \/>\nBuilt between 548 and 565, the monastery is one of the oldest working Christian monasteries in the world. The site contains the world&#8217;s oldest continually operating library, founded sometime between 548 and 565, and preserves the second largest collection of early codices and manuscripts in the world, outnumbered only by the Vatican Library. It contains Greek, Christian Palestinian Aramaic, Syriac, Georgian, Arabic, Ethiopic\/Ge\u2018ez, Latin, Armenian, Church Slavonic, and Caucasian Albanian[30] manuscripts and books, and very rare Hebrew Language, some Coptic books. The most unique books are the Codex Sinaiticus until 1859, of which recently new folios have come to light, including the Syriac Sinaiticus.<br \/>\n<em>Christian traditions. <\/em>During Catherine&#8217;s imprisonment, more than 200 people came to see her, including Maxentius&#8217; wife,\u00a0Valeria Maximilla; all converted to Christianity and were subsequently\u00a0martyred.\u00a0The furious emperor condemned Catherine to death on a spiked\u00a0breaking wheel, but, at her touch, it shattered. Maxentius ordered her to be\u00a0beheaded. Catherine herself ordered the execution to commence. A milk-like substance rather than blood flowed from her neck.<br \/>\nThe monastery has become a favourite site of pilgrimage.<br \/>\n<em>History.<\/em> The oldest record of monastic life at Mount Sinai comes from the travel journal written in Latin by a pilgrim woman named\u00a0Egeria\u00a0(Etheria; St Sylvia of Aquitaine) about 381\/2\u2013386.<br \/>\nThe monastery was built by order of Emperor\u00a0Justinian I\u00a0(reigned 527\u2013565), enclosing the Chapel of the Burning Bush (also known as &#8220;Saint Helen&#8217;s Chapel&#8221;) ordered to be built by\u00a0Empress Consort Helena, mother of\u00a0Constantine the Great, at the site where Moses is supposed to have seen the\u00a0burning bush. The living bush on the grounds is purportedly the one seen by Moses.\u00a0Structurally the monastery&#8217;s\u00a0king post\u00a0truss is the oldest known surviving roof\u00a0truss\u00a0in the world.\u00a0The site is sacred to\u00a0Christianity,\u00a0Islam, and\u00a0Judaism.<br \/>\nA\u00a0mosque\u00a0was created by converting an existing chapel during the\u00a0Fatimid Caliphate\u00a0(909\u20131171), which was in regular use until the era of the\u00a0Mamluk Sultanate\u00a0in the 13th century and is still in use today on special occasions. During the\u00a0Ottoman Empire, the mosque was in desolate condition; it was restored in the early 20th century.<br \/>\nDuring the seventh century, the isolated Christian\u00a0anchorites\u00a0of the Sinai were eliminated: only the fortified monastery remained. The monastery is still surrounded by the massive fortifications that have preserved it. Until the twentieth century, access was through a door high in the outer walls. From the time of the\u00a0First Crusade, the presence of Crusaders in the Sinai until 1270 spurred the interest of European Christians and increased the number of intrepid pilgrims who visited the monastery.<br \/>\n<em>Manuscripts and icons. <\/em>The\u00a0Codex Sinaiticus, dating from the 4th century, at the time the oldest almost completely preserved manuscript of the Bible. The finding from 1859 left the monastery for\u00a0Russia, in circumstances that had been long disputed. The Codex was sold by Stalin in 1933 to the British Museum and is now in the\u00a0British Library, London, where it is on public display. Prior to September 1, 2009, a previously unseen fragment of Codex Sinaiticus was discovered in the monastery&#8217;s library,\u00a0as well as among the New Finds of 1975.\u00a0On other visits (1855, 1857)\u00a0Constantin von Tischendorf\u00a0also amassed there more valuable manuscripts (Greek,\u00a0Christian Palestinian Aramaic,\u00a0Georgian,\u00a0Syriac) and took them with him to St Petersburg and Leipzig, where they are stored today. The Monastery also has a copy of the\u00a0Ashtiname of Muhammad, in which the Islamic prophet\u00a0Muhammad\u00a0is claimed to have bestowed his protection upon the monastery.<br \/>\nAdditionally, the monastery houses a copy of Mok&#8217;c&#8217;evay K&#8217;art&#8217;lisay, a collection of supplementary books of the\u00a0Kartlis Cxovreba, dating from the 9th century.<br \/>\n<em>Works of art. <\/em>The complex houses irreplaceable works of art: mosaics, the best collection of early\u00a0icons\u00a0in the world, many in\u00a0encaustic, as well as liturgical objects, chalices and reliquaries, and church buildings. The large icon collection begins with a few dating to the 5th (possibly) and 6th centuries, which are unique survivals; the monastery having been untouched by\u00a0Byzantine iconoclasm\u00a0and never sacked.<br \/>\nThe monastery is reached by an 11 km, dead-end road off the main highway. There are multiple checkpoints and bureaucratic issues. Stop and have all your details recorded by a police officer. Pay a government fee of US$10, five for you and five for the car.

There is a bookstore, 2 coffee shops, a restaurant, 11 rooms for visitors, several greenhouses, and an orchard with, grape trellises, fruit, and olive trees. Outside, it appears to be a walled fortress with 20-meter-high walls.<br \/>\nEnter the monastery proper through a tiny thick metal door to see the well and bush, then go into the museum. It is very well done with a complete display of portable icons dating from the 6th century, many Bibles dating to the 11th century, crosses and other religious paraphernalia. 70 LE<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mountain Chains<\/strong> (12\/06\/2003). The High Mountain Region, home to the Jabaleya Bedouin, is around the town of St. Katherine. The town itself lies at about 1600 meters from sea level, and many of the surrounding mountains are above 2000 meters, with Mt. Katherine the tallest at 2642 meters. The high ranges continue on towards the coast in the west and south, with some of the most impressive mountains, such as Jebel Umm Shaumar and Jebel Serbal, offering magnificent views on the big sandy floodplain at El Tur city and the Gulf of Suez.\u00a0The area, little known for most Westerners, is a unique trekkers\u2019 paradise.<br \/>\nBecause of its elevation, the area receives more precipitation than the rest of the Sinai peninsula and is still relatively wet \u2013 it is a desert ecosystem, but there are hundreds of Bedouin orchards and several natural water pools. The area is mostly granite with characteristic smooth red domes and hidden basins, although about 20% is newer volcanic rock, black-coloured and covered with broken, loose gravel. The two rock types often combine, with half a mountain belonging to one and the other to the other rock type. The whole region stands above the rest of the peninsula, and from its perimeter, you can see down to smaller ranges, plains and at points to the sea. The climate is cooler than the rest of Egypt\u2019s, making possible a unique flora and a wide variety of domesticated fruit species. In winter there might be snow and the temperatures can drop far below zero at higher elevations, although the days are usually still pleasantly warm.<br \/>\n<strong>Mount Katharina<\/strong> is the highest mountain in Egypt at 2642 meters, with a small Orthodox church on the summit. According to tradition, this is the place where monks, after a dream, found the missing body of the martyred St.Katherina. Jebel Musa (Mt. Sinai) is right below, and the views of it and the whole high mountain area are stunning. In most winters there is at least a little snow and the temperature can be chilly even on summer nights.<br \/>\n<strong>Mount Sinai<\/strong> is a mountain that may be the same as the\u00a0biblical Mount Sinai, the place where, according to the Bible,\u00a0Moses\u00a0received the\u00a0Ten Commandments.<br \/>\nIt is a 2,285-metre (7,497 ft), moderately high mountain near the St Catherine monastery. It is surrounded by higher peaks in the mountain range of which it is a part. For example, it lies next to Mount Catherine, which, at 2,629 m or 8,625 ft, is the highest peak in Egypt.<br \/>\nMount Sinai&#8217;s rocks were formed during the late stage of the evolution of the\u00a0Arabian-Nubian Shield. Mount Sinai displays a\u00a0ring complex\u00a0that consists of alkaline\u00a0granites\u00a0intruded into diverse rock types, including\u00a0volcanics that are represented by subaerial flows and eruptions and\u00a0subvolcanic\u00a0porphyry. Generally, the nature of the exposed rocks in Mount Sinai indicates that they were formed at different depths from one another.<br \/>\nReligious significance. Judaism\/Christianity. Immediately north of the mountain is the 6th-century Saint Catherine&#8217;s Monastery. The summit has a mosque still used, and a Greek Orthodox chapel, constructed in 1934 on the ruins of a 16th-century church, that is not open to the public. The chapel encloses the rock which is considered to be the source for the biblical Tablets of Stone. At the summit also is &#8220;Moses&#8217; cave&#8221;, where Moses was said to have waited to receive the Ten Commandments.<br \/>\n<em>Ascent and summit. <\/em>There are two principal routes to the summit. The longer and shallower route,\u00a0Siket El Bashait, takes about 2.5 hours on foot, though\u00a0camels\u00a0can be used. The steeper, more direct route (Siket Sayidna Musa) is up the 3,750 &#8220;steps of penitence&#8221; in the ravine behind the monastery.

The\u00a0Fortress of an-Nekhel\u00a0is a\u00a0Ksar\u00a0(castle) located in the\u00a0Nekhel\u00a0Municipality. It holds a strategic location at the exact center of the peninsula. Excavations at the site have revealed remains dating from Ancient Egypt. It has historically been an important stop and staging ground for Muslim pilgrims undertaking the\u00a0Hajj\u00a0or\u00a0Umra, holy\u00a0Muslim\u00a0pilgrimages.<br \/>\n<em>Mamluk era. <\/em>A fortress was built on the site. A group of Christian pilgrims (including Felix Fabri) in 1483 recorded that there was a great well at an-Nekhel which was called the &#8220;Well of the Sultan&#8221; because during the pilgrimage season, the Sultan employed a man with two camels to draw water all day for the pilgrims. The Frenchmen were on their way to Saint Catherine&#8217;s Monastery and avoided the well due to the uncertainty of the reception they might receive.<br \/>\n<em>Ottoman era. <\/em>The existing fortress was built by\u00a0Sultan Selim\u00a0in the sixteenth century, following his invasion of Egypt in 1517. &#8220;Moorish&#8221; soldiers were stationed to protect the pilgrims who came from Egypt, Morocco, Algiers, and Spain.<br \/>\n<em>Mohammed Ali era. <\/em>Johann Ludwig Burckhardt, who visited the site in the first decade of the 19th century, reported a large building with stone walls and no habitations around it. There was a large reservoir for the pilgrims filled from a brackish well. The garrison consisted of about fifty soldiers and the fort was used as a magazine to provision the\u00a0Egyptian Army\u00a0in its\u00a0expeditions\u00a0against the\u00a0Wahabis.<br \/>\nIn the nineteenth century, when the route was still used by pilgrims, the road was infested with hyenas, and dabba, which fed on the dead camels which had fallen by the wayside. If very hungry, packs were known to have attacked solitary travellers. The residents of an-Nekhel would not leave the village at night for fear of attack and kept dogs to frighten off the scavengers.<br \/>\nAn explorer at the beginning of the 20th century described it as a square fort on &#8220;absolutely barren ground&#8221;, built as a place to provide Haj pilgrims with water. It was manned by an officer and ten soldiers; a village around the fort consisted of fifteen to twenty houses inhabited by ex-soldiers and their families. All food was transported from Gaza or Suez, though the villagers cultivated small patches of ground with corn and maize when Wadi el-Arish flooded. This did not occur every year and the Wadi dried up very quickly. Some of the villagers also kept camels. It took the Cairo pilgrims three days to reach an-Nekhel from Suez, and another three days to reach Aqaba.<br \/>\n<em>World War I. <\/em>Around 1900 the pilgrimage switched its route to one along the shores of the Gulf of Suez, and an-Nekhel went into decline. The fortress was blown up by the Turkish army during WWI. Two British cavalry columns with three airplanes, commanded by Colonel William Grant, approached an-Nekhel on 17 February 1917, to find that it had been abandoned. This was the last British action in their Sinai campaign against the Turks. T.E. Lawrence writes, in chapter 59 (Seven Pillars of Wisdom), of passing near the fort ruins on his way from the capture of Aqaba in July 1917 to report to the Egyptian British command.<br \/>\nA visitor, around 1930, found three policemen, a corporal, and one villager, and recommended the big reservoir as worth a visit. Travelling by car, the road to an-Nekhel was slow due to water gullies, several inches deep, every two or three hundred yards, reducing the vehicle&#8217;s speed to 25 miles per hour.<br \/>\n<em>1956 war. <\/em>During Israel&#8217;s\u00a0Sinai Campaign, an-Nekhel was captured by the\u00a0Israeli Army\u00a0on the evening of 30 October 1956.<br \/>\n<em>1967 war.<\/em> An-Nekhel fell on 7 June to the IDF&#8217;s 14th Armored Brigade, a force belonging to (now General) Ariel Sharon&#8217;s 38th Division. In the ensuing battle, the Egyptians lost 60 tanks, over 100 guns and 300 other vehicles. In 1969 Haidar Abdel-Shafi, a lawyer and Palestinian political leader from Gaza was exiled to an-Nekhel for three months, by the Israelis.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>National Parks<br \/>\n<\/em>Abu Galum Protected Area\u00a0<\/strong>covers an area of about 400km\u00b2, situated on the east coast of South Sinai, right between\u00a0Dahab\u00a0and\u00a0Nuweiba. It protects various coastal and mountain ecosystems that are unique to the\u00a0Gulf of Aqaba. The\u00a0coral reef\u00a0is mostly undisturbed with a high diversity of reef fish, whose richness of its\u00a0flora\u00a0and\u00a0fauna\u00a0is overwhelming.<br \/>\nThe reef at Abu Galum supports an active Beduine artisanal fishery. As in other protected areas, you can see them standing in the water (unfortunately also on the reef) and fishing. They supply as well the local restaurants with the fish they get throughout the day. However, the fishery was regulated (EEAA) just some years ago to reduce the damage done to the delicate coral reef.<br \/>\nProbably, Abu Galum is one of the most beautiful protectorates in Egypt. Its high mountains, its wadis, freshwater springs, picturesque sand dunes, coral reef, and gravel alluvial fans, this area hosts about 165 plant species. About 45 of these species can only be seen in Abu Galum and are unique to this area.<br \/>\nTo protect Abu Galum as a Natural Resource Area, it is only allowed to drive on marked trails that have been prepared. Bedouin guides lead you with camels to the places of interest.<br \/>\n<strong>Colored Canyon.<\/strong> One of those best-kept secrets of Egypt, it is located near Nuweiba accessible by private tour. Millions of years ago, the Sinai desert was eventually part of the Red Sea, and the canyon was created by the erosion of water upon sandstone and limestone. The canyon mouth is accessible by car, and its short length (about 700 meters) makes for perfect hiking. As one ventures into the canyon, the walls narrow in width to just a few feet in some places.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"lazy\" title=\"The Natural Wonder of the Colored Canyon\" src=\"https:\/\/images.memphistours.com\/large\/74e470d5deb57110e1e1c677a0c130c6.jpg\" alt=\"The Natural Wonder of the Colored Canyon\" width=\"621\" height=\"414\" border=\"0\" data-src=\"https:\/\/images.memphistours.com\/large\/74e470d5deb57110e1e1c677a0c130c6.jpg\" \/><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"lazy\" title=\"The Natural Wonder of the Colored Canyon\" src=\"https:\/\/images.memphistours.com\/large\/0046aeb4d687a7435e95c69a292254d8.jpg\" alt=\"The Natural Wonder of the Colored Canyon\" width=\"619\" height=\"413\" border=\"0\" data-src=\"https:\/\/images.memphistours.com\/large\/0046aeb4d687a7435e95c69a292254d8.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Day 14<\/span><br \/>\n<em>I stayed in My Hostel in Dahab for one night and drove the next day to Sharm El Sheik to return my rental car.

As I was coming from Dahab, Google Maps directed me off the highway well before Sharm El Sheikh. Follow the most prominent track deviating from the route on GM. It gets sandy in a few places but I had no problem in my small car. Eventually, I rejoined the GM track. But then the track disappeared, so I drove around and couldn\u2019t find the exact route. I drove to the left where there are some Bedouin camps and a small kid ran out to greet me and offered to \u201cguide\u201d me to the cinema. He spoke great English (along with some Russian) and his little brother jumped into the car. Dad asked me to be back in 30 minutes. He directed me to the cinema following some rocky bits and a rougher road.<br \/>\nThe kid would not stop asking to drive (even though he was only about 10).<br \/>\nThe theatre looks little like the old pictures \u2013 none of the seats remain and have collapsed onto the ground. A raised area looks like it held a screen at one time. At the back are 3 small domed buildings that I assume were the \u201cprojection facilities\u201d. After some photos, I drove the kids back home and gave him 50 LE for all his help. He didn\u2019t seem to care about the money as he was only interested in driving!<br \/>\nI put in the Dancing Fountain and drove to Sharm El Sheikh directly south trying to pick the best of several tracks created by all the ATVers who come out to this area.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Day 14-20<br \/>\n<\/span><em>I then stayed at My Hostel for the next 6 nights to go diving and repeat my PADI advanced diver course.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>DAHAB <\/strong>(pop 15,000) is a small Egyptian town on the southeast coast of the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt, approximately 80 km (50 mi) northeast of Sharm el-Sheikh. Formerly a Bedouin fishing village, Dahab is now considered to be one of Egypt&#8217;s most treasured diving destinations. Following the Six-Day War, Sinai was occupied by Israel. The Sinai Peninsula was restored to Egyptian rule under the Egypt\u2013Israel Peace Treaty in 1982. Egypt&#8217;s former president, Hosni Mubarak helped the arrival of many local and international tourism companies, and hotel chains, and the establishment of many other ancillary facilities has since made the town resorts a popular destination with tourists. Dahab is served by Sharm el-Sheikh International Airport. Masbat (within Dahab) is a popular diving destination, and there are many (50+) dive centers located within Dahab. Most of Dahab&#8217;s diving spots are shore dives.<br \/>\nDahab can be divided into three major parts. Masbat, which includes the Bedouin village Asalah, is in the north. South of Masbat is Mashraba, which is more tourist and has considerably more hotels. In the southwest is Medina which includes the Laguna area, famous for its excellent shallow-water windsurfing.<br \/>\nThe region of Asalah is quite developed and has many campsites and hostels. Most people who have visited Dahab in the past were backpackers interested in diving and snorkelling in the Red Sea.<br \/>\nDahab attracts large numbers of tourists. It is world-renowned for its windsurfing. Reliable winds provide superb flat-water conditions inside Dahab&#8217;s sand spit. Further away from shore, wavy conditions coupled with strong winds provide formidable conditions for keen windsurfers. However, in recent years, the lagoon inside the sand spit has been overtaken by kitesurfers, with two Russian-owned schools opening right on the beach. SCUBA diving, free-diving, and snorkelling are also popular activities with many reefs immediately adjacent to waterfront hotels. The nearby Blue Hole (nicknamed &#8220;The World&#8217;s Most Dangerous Diving Site&#8221;) and Canyon are internationally famous dive spots. The increasing destruction of coral by reckless divers\/dive centres diving is a pressing issue that is causing some worry, sparking the need to regulate dive centers more thoroughly.<br \/>\nLand-based activities include rock climbing,\u00a0camel\u00a0riding,\u00a0horse\u00a0riding,\u00a0cycling,\u00a0mountain biking\u00a0trips,\u00a0jeep,\u00a0and\u00a0quad bike\u00a0trips.\u00a0Mount Sinai\u00a0is a two-hour drive, with\u00a0Saint Catherine&#8217;s Monastery\u00a0being a popular tourist destination.<br \/>\nHistorically, most visitors to Dahab have been backpackers travelling independently and staying in hostels, motels or guesthouses in the Masbat area. In recent years, the development of hotels in the Medina area has facilitated the arrival of a wider range of tourists, many of whom visit Dahab specifically to partake in surfing, windsurfing, diving, kite surfing, sailing, and other activities.<br \/>\n<strong>Natural and tourist attractions.\u00a0<\/strong>The city has many of the most prominent attractions in Ras Abu Gallum, a nature reserve, and a diving area. It is one of the world&#8217;s most famous dive spots. The Kanoun region is one of the best diving areas in Al-Asala, a region where about 75% of the population of the city is divided into three areas (Mubarak City, Zarnouk, Al-Asala), Coral Island, and the remains of a historic fortress built by the Crusaders, Al-Mellil, a road parallel to the coast road, which includes some small hotels, cafeterias and houses, The main neighbourhood of the city starts with Al Fanar Street and then Masbat Bay with shops, diving clubs, cafes, camps, hotels and many cafeterias and diving centers. It also includes the only impact there is Tel Mashraba. It is located in the old city of Dahab.<br \/>\nWadi Qani is an area that represents the future urban expansion of the city because it includes a wide range of hotels, service and residential complexes, as well as the areas of Lighthouse and the Garden Garden and Oasis. Dahab comprises two gulfs, the Laguna or Ghazala, which is characterized by the city&#8217;s only sandy beach and the city&#8217;s cistern, as well as resorts along its shores that integrate with the surrounding nature with log-and-palm kiosks for tourists.<br \/>\n<strong>Climate.<\/strong> Dahab has a hot desert climate like the rest of Egypt and hot at night. Winter days are warm and nights are mild. Dahab has a dry climate and rain is rare, even during the winter months. The precipitation peaks in February.<\/p>\n<p>Diving.
