There are 5 people buried here, all descendants of Peter V. Verigin &#8211; the leader of the Doukhobors between 1908 and 1936. Verigins Tomb was built in 1924 and is the burial place for the Doukhobor leader, Peter V Verigin, his son Peter P Verigin and their wives Evdokia Grigoryevna and Anna Fyodorovna. Just down the way, a memorial garden is the final resting place of the Doukhobor leader.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">From its perch, the tomb enjoys views of the Kootenay River and the Highway #3A Bridge. The tomb grounds are very well maintained. The grass lawns are trimmed, the garden flowers enjoy rainbow colours, the slab rock tomb is dominant and there is a gazebo for sightseeing. A unique feature of Verigin&#8217;s Tomb is a large slab of rock engraved with the eulogy of Peter V Verigin.
