It turned over the responsibility for many people who would have been destined for institutions to local authorities. Thousands of children who would have been invisible in previous generations were dumped back into communities that had few resources and services for them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>MILDRED CREEK.<\/strong><br \/>\nA psychiatrist at the Great Ormond Hospital in London, it was the first such facility in Britain to offer state-of-the-art medical care to the children of families with limited means. She contended that \u201cpsychosis\u201d among children was not rare. The constellation of traits shared by many of these children \u2013 a lack of \u201csocial awareness.\u201d \u201cRigidity of behaviour and speech irregularities could have been lifted directly from Kanner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>LORNA WING<br \/>\n<\/strong>She was a British psychiatrist who embarked on a quest to discover the kinds of assistance and services that would be most useful to families like her autistic daughter. When she was 6, she decided that what she wanted to do for a living was to figure out how things worked and studied biology, chemistry, and physics. At 16, she decided to study medicine. She married John Wing, a doctor with similar interests. Their first child had autism, and one of her early teachers was Sybil Edgar, who ran classes for autistic children in her house. With other parents, they founded what was to become the National Autistic Society in 1961. The logo adopted by the society \u2013 a puzzle piece \u2013 eventually became the universal symbol of autism parents&#8217; organizations worldwide. The Sybil Edgar School found larger quarters, and even the Beatles became involved, with John Lennon a major donor.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As Elgar\u2019s students became teenagers, she turned her attention to autistic adults, realizing they were not \u201ccured\u201d and would require a living environment suited to their needs for the rest of their lives. \u201cChildren need praise and encouragement, but most of all they need the opportunity to continue their education and training to maintain and extend abilities&#8230; and acquire occupational skills.\u201d In 1972, the society launched Somerset House, the first residential facility and European school for autistic adults.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">These achievements put Lorna and her colleagues light years ahead of their American peers in understanding autism. They knew that autism might manifest itself in varying degrees of severity. She thought Kanner\u2019s theories of refrigerator mothers were bloody stupid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Michael Ritter conducted the first twin study of autism, providing proof of the genetic basis for the first time. He also untangled autism from schizophrenia, showing that they were separate conditions that only rarely occur together. <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Using restrictive criteria, an attempt to determine the prevalence of autism came up with an estimate of 4.5 per 10,000, a very low number. Other researchers replicated this and became the oft-quoted baseline against which all future autism prevalence estimates would be compared in the coming decades.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Lorna realized that the study left out most children likely to fall on the Asperger side of the spectrum. She also had Asperger\u2019s paper translated from German to English and realized that Asperger had seen the same thing in his Vienna clinic that she was seeing. They were kids that nobody knew what to do with. They didn\u2019t fit into Kanner\u2019s narrow box. They were also brilliant, but couldn\u2019t pick up subtle social signals from the people they were talking to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">No diagnostic label on the books would enable them to access psychiatric services. There were many shades and hues along the autistic continuum, and all autistic people seemed to benefit from the same highly structured and supportive educational approaches, just as Asperger had predicted. Some children remained profoundly disabled, while others blossomed in unexpected ways when given an accommodating environment and special consideration by their teachers.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Lorna then introduced a new diagnostic label \u2013 Asperger\u2019s syndrome \u2013 as autism had so many negative connotations. She then wrote a case series in 1981. She changed the continuum to the autism spectrum, indicating that the continuum shades imperceptibly into garden-variety eccentricity \u2013 all the features that characterize Asperger\u2019s syndrome can be found in varying degrees in the normal population.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>BRITAIN Britain passed the Mental Health Act in 1959 in response to a series of scandals about overcrowding and inhumane conditions in the country\u2019s mental institutions and homes for the \u201csubnormal.\u201d The Mental Health Act dismantled the legal apparatus that &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2021\/11\/01\/britain-lorna-wing\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-15652","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-uncategorized"],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p2Ncip-44s","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/15652","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=15652"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/15652\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":24515,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/15652\/revisions\/24515"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=15652"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=15652"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=15652"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
