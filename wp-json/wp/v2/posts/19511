But health experts are alarmed by its growing and widespread use under lax safety conditions.<\/p>\n<p>Last month the U.S. Food and Drug Administration published a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/drugs\/human-drug-compounding\/fda-warns-patients-and-health-care-providers-about-potential-risks-associated-compounded-ketamine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">notice to patients and providers<\/a>\u00a0outlining potentially serious physical and psychological dangers from ketamine, which is frequently administered in clinics or practitioners\u2019 offices by intravenous infusion or injection and induces a quasi-psychedelic state filled with fantastical thoughts and imagery.<\/p>\n<p>The FDA also asserted that because it had only approved the use of this drug during surgery, robust clinical trials for the wide range of pain and mental health conditions it is used for are lacking.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe overall benefit-risk profile of ketamine for treatment of psychiatric disorders is unknown,\u201d the agency asserted. (The statement does not cover Spravato, a nasal spray delivery of a specific form of ketamine, esketamine, which the FDA approved in 2019 for adults with treatment-resistant depression when taken with antidepressants. But\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S016503272032766X?via=ihub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">some research shows the spray is not as effective<\/a>\u00a0as the intravenous version.)<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not that nobody should try the drug. Ketamine does work in a lot of people. I\u2019ve seen it change lives.\u00a0But it\u2019s definitely a case of patient beware, she says.<\/p>\n<p>Ketamine is unique in how rapid a response it provides, recently described <a href=\"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fpsyt.2023.1160442\/full\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">significant improvements in anxiety and depression after one to six ketamine-assisted psychotherapy sessions<\/a> in 18 patients at her clinic with substance use disorder.<\/p>\n<p>Conditions like suicidal depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder are really impactful in people\u2019s functioning and quality of life and are difficult to treat even with good psychotherapy and expert medication management.<\/p>\n<h2>Significant side effects<\/h2>\n<p>Ketamine should only be administered in settings equipped to handle medical emergencies, Holmes says, which is not generally the case for the many wellness clinics and telehealth providers adopting the drug for a wide range of mental health applications and fueling a $3 billion industry that is\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.grandviewresearch.com\/industry-analysis\/us-ketamine-clinics-market-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">projected to grow 10 percent annually<\/a>\u00a0through the end of the decade.<\/p>\n<p>More research is needed to better understand who might benefit from ketamine therapy, what the proper protocol should be, and, importantly, how it works. Current thinking is the drug increases the connections between synapses in the brain, allowing for new thought pathways to develop.<\/p>\n<p>While some people experience only mild and fleeting nausea, headaches, or upset stomach while on the drug, others may have slowed breathing or increased blood pressure.<\/p>\n<p>If someone has a preexisting cardiac issue, this could be dangerous &#8211; all prospective ketamine patients at Yale undergo an electrocardiogram heart test beforehand and their vitals are monitored during each session.<\/p>\n<p>Equally crucial, some clinics also don\u2019t provide sufficient psychological support. Patients may be frightened during the hallucinations, Whinkin says. These generally last under an hour, much shorter than for true psychedelics like psilocybin or lysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD. (To capitalize on the growing interest in psychedelic medicine, many clinics advertise ketamine as psychedelic-assisted therapy even though it is not an actual psychedelic.)<\/p>\n<p>Post-treatment \u201cintegration\u201d sessions are a vital part of the experience. It is an opportunity to explore psychological material that came up during the journey, and if there\u2019s any confusion or confrontation of preexisting beliefs about the self or the world, that deserves skilled support.<\/p>\n<p>As its name implies, integration therapy, when properly done, also incorporates the altered experience into practical actions. What\u2019s the way forward to harness the experience to make a notable change to how you live day to day?.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the biggest concern is the growing use of ketamine at home\u2014via oral capsules or pills held under the tongue, which are two delivery systems that are poorly understood. Thanks to regulations that began in 2020 after the start of the pandemic, only a brief telehealth appointment rather than an in-person visit is needed before ketamine arrives at the home.<\/p>\n<p>Prescribing it for at-home use is irresponsible, because it needs to be taken under supervision by trained professionals. Using these products without concurrent monitoring by a healthcare provider \u201cmay put patients at risk for serious adverse events,\u201d the FDA notice states.<\/p>\n<p>At-home usage also increases the potential for abuse, since ketamine is illegally sold recreationally under the name Special K. This is especially troubling since some clinics use it to treat substance abuse. I\u2019ve seen my pain patients, opioid-dependent, given nasal ketamine and they\u2019ve gone home and abused it by stocking up and then binging, he says.<\/p>\n<h2>For some, lasting relief<\/h2>\n<p>Others worry that a medicine they consider a lifeline is being misused. Shira Renee Thomas, the 45-year-old artistic director of a Southern California performing arts company, believes she might not be here were it not for ketamine.<\/p>\n<p>For 25 years, Thomas experienced bouts of such extreme depression she regularly pondered suicide. Unable to leave her bed for months at a time, the disease severely impacted her quality of life and derailed an opera singing career.<\/p>\n<p>Over the years she was hospitalized multiple times, prescribed some 20 different medications\u2014individually and in combination\u2014and even had electroconvulsive therapy, which she had to stop after losing so much memory she couldn\u2019t remember how to drive a car or sign her name on a check.<\/p>\n<p>Four years ago, Thomas found a clinic offering ketamine.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy very first infusion was like magic,\u201d she recalls. While under its spell, she watched an earth goddess effortlessly flick away the demeaning words she would yell at herself while depressed, such as that she was stupid or useless. That behaviour subsequently ceased.<\/p>\n<p>It took several years for other symptoms to be extinguished, but after close to 100 ketamine sessions, with maintenance sessions ongoing, she has not had a depressive episode in almost a year. (This cost her family some $30,000, because ketamine treatment is often not covered by insurance, although her insurer recently agreed to start paying.)<\/p>\n<p>Given its potential and its risks, Schatman wants people to be clearly informed of the pros and cons of ketamine therapy before they receive a treatment.<\/p>\n<p>Some patients go into infusion clinics being told this will help them, who are not even aware they might hallucinate. People should also know there is no scientifically proven protocol, so each provider can invent their own rules about how much and how often to give it.<\/p>\n<p>People need to understand they are experimenting. Some are in so much pain they are willing to roll the dice.<\/p>\n<p>If they do so they should boost their odds by seeing a practitioner with deep knowledge of the drug who takes safety seriously as opposed to some local clinic or telehealth provider.<br \/>\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<\/p>\n<header class=\"ArticleHero_root__3w7kV ArticleHero_articleStandard__2tcdv\" data-event-module=\"hero\">\n<div class=\"\">\n<div class=\"ArticleHero_defaultArticleLockup__vb8lz\">\n<div class=\"ArticleHero_title__PQ4pC\">\n<h1 class=\"ArticleTitle_root__VrZaG\" data-flatplan-title=\"true\">What Ketamine Does to the Human Brain<\/h1>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"ArticleHero_dek__EqdkK\" data-flatplan-description=\"true\">\n<p class=\"ArticleDek_root__P3leE\">Excessive use of the drug can make anyone feel like they rule the world.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"ArticleHero_byline__iFT6A\">\n<div class=\"ArticleBylines_root__IBR5V\">\n<address id=\"byline\">By\u00a0<a class=\"ArticleBylines_link__kNP4C\" href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/author\/shayla-love\/\" data-event-element=\"author\" data-flatplan-author-link=\"true\">Shayla Love<\/a><\/address>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"ArticleLeadArt_root__nRSLU\">\n<figure class=\"ArticleLeadFigure_root__Bj81R ArticleLeadFigure_standard__20Izv\">\n<div class=\"ArticleLeadFigure_media__R1npW\" data-flatplan-lead_figure_media=\"true\"><picture><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" id=\"article-lead-image\" class=\"Image_root__XxsOp ArticleLeadArt_image__HZS4B\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.theatlantic.com\/thumbor\/eiFNJekfeLtXdr8VxGUBC0Gpvbc=\/0x0:2000x1125\/960x540\/media\/img\/mt\/2025\/03\/20250227_ketamine_1\/original.jpg\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 976px) 976px, 100vw\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn.theatlantic.com\/thumbor\/lO9uacAkmhri18l7Ao7ubgeGACY=\/0x0:2000x1125\/750x422\/media\/img\/mt\/2025\/03\/20250227_ketamine_1\/original.jpg 750w, https:\/\/cdn.theatlantic.com\/thumbor\/olIdZs58LR2EYjujej78AUJXUUw=\/0x0:2000x1125\/828x466\/media\/img\/mt\/2025\/03\/20250227_ketamine_1\/original.jpg 828w, https:\/\/cdn.theatlantic.com\/thumbor\/eiFNJekfeLtXdr8VxGUBC0Gpvbc=\/0x0:2000x1125\/960x540\/media\/img\/mt\/2025\/03\/20250227_ketamine_1\/original.jpg 960w, https:\/\/cdn.theatlantic.com\/thumbor\/GJHBfnaM-N5YeoX34ZxKehsv0p4=\/0x0:2000x1125\/976x549\/media\/img\/mt\/2025\/03\/20250227_ketamine_1\/original.jpg 976w, https:\/\/cdn.theatlantic.com\/thumbor\/gs8T19bLKPJKME6nAfWly4sYAyY=\/0x0:2000x1125\/1952x1098\/media\/img\/mt\/2025\/03\/20250227_ketamine_1\/original.jpg 1952w\" alt=\"Collage of overlapping, translucent profile images of Elon Musk in shades of purple, gray, and yellow\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" \/><\/picture><\/div><figcaption class=\"ArticleLeadFigure_caption__Byu7W ArticleLeadFigure_standardCaption__PsDkd\" data-flatplan-lead_figure_caption=\"true\">Illustration by The Atlantic.

Last year, Musk told CNN\u2019s Don Lemon that he has a ketamine prescription and uses the drug roughly every other week to help with depression symptoms. When Lemon asked if Musk ever abused ketamine, Musk replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think so. If you use too much ketamine you can\u2019t really get work done,\u201d then said that<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2024\/03\/18\/tech\/elon-musk-ketamine-use-don-lemon-interview\/index.html\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">\u00a0investors<\/a>\u00a0in his companies should want him to keep up his drug regimen. Not everyone is convinced.\u00a0<em>The Wall Street Journal<\/em>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/silicon-valley-microdosing-ketamine-lsd-magic-mushrooms-d381e214\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">has<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/business\/elon-musk-illegal-drugs-e826a9e1\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">\u00a0reported<\/a>\u00a0that Musk also takes the drug recreationally, and in 2023, Ronan Farrow reported in\u00a0<em>The New Yorker<\/em>\u00a0that Musk\u2019s \u201cassociates\u201d worried that ketamine, \u201calongside his isolation and his increasingly embattled relationship with the press, might contribute to his tendency to make chaotic and impulsive statements and decisions.\u201d (Musk did not respond to my requests for comment. In a post on X responding to\u00a0<em>The New Yorker<\/em>\u2019s story, Musk wrote, \u201cTragic that Ronan Farrow is a puppet of the establishment and against the people.\u201d)<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Ketamine is called a dissociative drug because during a high, which lasts about an hour, people might feel detached from their body, their emotions, or the passage of time. Frequent, heavy recreational use\u2014say, several times a week\u2014has been linked to cognitive effects that last beyond the high, including impaired memory, delusional thinking, superstitious beliefs, and a sense of specialness and importance. You can see why people might wonder about ketamine use from a man who is trying to usher in multi-planetary human life, who has\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2025\/02\/28\/us\/politics\/musk-federal-bureaucracy-takeover.html\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">barged<\/a>\u00a0into global politics and is attempting to reengineer the U.S. government. With Musk\u2019s new political power, his cognitive and psychological health is of concern not only to shareholders of his companies\u2019 stocks but to all Americans. His late-night posts on X, mass emails to federal employees, and non sequiturs uttered on television have prompted even more questions about his drug use.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Ketamine\u2019s great strength has always been its ability to sever humans from the world around them. It was first approved as an anesthetic in 1970, because it could make people lose consciousness without affecting the quality of their breathing. In the 1990s, as a street drug known as\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.3402\/ehtj.v4i0.7107#d1e470\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">Special K<\/a>, ketamine took ravers to euphoric states. Then, in the 2000s, researchers found that doses of<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S0006322399002309?via%3Dihub\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">\u00a0ketamine<\/a>\u00a0that didn\u2019t put people to sleep could rapidly reduce symptoms of depression, because, the thinking went, the drug altered the physical circuitry of the brain. In 2019, the FDA approved a nasal spray containing a form of ketamine called esketamine (sold under the brand name Spravato) for patients with depression who hadn\u2019t responded to other treatments. Spravato came with a list of rules for how the drug should be administered: in a certified medical setting by a health-care professional, and with\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.spravatohcp.com\/files\/chaesk_digital_smdd_dosing_adminguide.pdf\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">limited dosage amounts<\/a>\u00a0determined by how long a person has been in treatment.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">But Spravato\u2019s approval was followed by a surge in prescriptions for generic ketamine, which, because it\u2019s already FDA-approved as an anesthetic, can be administered off-label without the rules that govern esketamine. (Recreational use has\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/today.ucsd.edu\/story\/ketamine-use-on-the-rise-in-u.s-adults-new-trends-emerge\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">shot up<\/a>\u00a0over the past decade too.) Some providers pair low-dose injections with talk therapy. Across the country,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.harpersbazaar.com\/beauty\/a43920470\/ketamines-woo-woo-rebrand\/\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">bespoke<\/a>\u00a0ketamine clinics offer shots and lozenges to treat a wide variety of mental-health conditions, including anxiety and PTSD; some focus on IV drips at doses high enough that maintaining a conversation is not feasible. Few take insurance. One market\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.grandviewresearch.com\/industry-analysis\/us-ketamine-clinics-market-report\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">report<\/a>\u00a0estimated that the ketamine industry was worth nearly $3.5 billion in 2023. Outside the clinic, the drug is\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/silicon-valley-microdosing-ketamine-lsd-magic-mushrooms-d381e214\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">reportedly<\/a>\u00a0popular among Silicon Valley\u2019s tech elite, and a feature at some wellness\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/ketamine-psychedelic-slumber-parties-tech-executives\/\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">retreats, including those for<\/a>\u00a0leadership development, corporate team building, or couples counseling.<\/p>\n<p id=\"injected-recirculation-link-0\" class=\"ArticleRelatedContentLink_root__VYc9V\" data-view-action=\"view link - injected link - item 1\" data-event-element=\"injected link\" data-event-position=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/health\/archive\/2024\/11\/psychedelics-maga-kennedy-trump\/680479\/\">Read: The horseshoe theory of psychedelics<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Research has not yet established the side effects of long-term ketamine therapy, but older studies of recreational users offer some insight on heavy, extended dosing. Celia Morgan, now a psychopharmacology professor at the University of Exeter, in England, led a 2010\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/19919593\/\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">study<\/a>\u00a0that followed 120 recreational ketamine users for a year. Even infrequent users\u2014those who used, on average, roughly three times a month\u2014scored higher on a delusional-thought scale than ex\u2013ketamine users, people who took other drugs, and people who didn\u2019t use drugs at all. Those who averaged 20 uses a month scored even higher. People believed that they were the sole recipients of secret messages, or that society and people around them were especially attuned to them. The psychological profile of a frequent ketamine user, Morgan and her team concluded, was someone who had \u201cprofound\u201d impairments in short- and long-term memory and was \u201cdistinctly dissociated in their day-to-day existence.\u201d Morgan\u2019s study was not designed to determine whether people who are more likely to be delusional are also more likely to recreationally use ketamine, but Morgan told me that stopping the drug, in most cases, will dramatically reduce these side effects.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Psychedelic enthusiasts have for decades cautioned about the dangers of prolonged ketamine use, including serious damage to the bladder, intense stomach cramps, and a struggle to stop using. In 1994, the researcher D. M. Turner wrote, \u201cA fairly large percentage of those who try Ketamine will consume it non-stop until their supply is exhausted.\u201d John Lilly, a neurophysiologist and psychedelic researcher who once used LSD to investigate dolphin communication, famously abused ketamine until he believed that he was contacted by an extraterrestrial entity who removed his penis. \u201cFor anyone who is using a very significant amount of ketamine on a regular basis over a long period of time, I think there\u2019s good reason to suspect that they could have different kinds of cognitive and psychological forms of impairment,\u201d David Mathai, a psychiatrist who offers ketamine therapy to some of his patients in Miami, told me.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Such theoretical impairments would be concerning in any context\u2014but especially when contemplating a person who has achieved enough power to be unironically described as\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2025\/02\/president-elon-musk-trump\/681558\/\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">co-president of the United States<\/a>. To be sure, ketamine may have nothing to do with his actions. He may be simply acting in accordance with his\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2024\/11\/x-white-supremacist-site\/680538\/\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">far-right political ideology<\/a>. Musk also famously brags that he\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/health\/400854\/elon-musk-trump-doge-sleep-studies\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">rarely sleeps<\/a>\u2014never a good strategy for measured speech or actions.<\/p>\n<p id=\"injected-recirculation-link-1\" class=\"ArticleRelatedContentLink_root__VYc9V\" data-view-action=\"view link - injected link - item 2\" data-event-element=\"injected link\" data-event-position=\"2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2025\/02\/president-elon-musk-trump\/681558\/\">Read: Elon Musk is president<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Musk hasn\u2019t publicly acknowledged the risks of ketamine, despite having once claimed that SSRIs, the drugs commonly used to treat depression, \u201czombify\u201d patients. Other highly visible ketamine promoters tend to do the same. Dylan Beynon, the founder of the ketamine telemedicine company Mindbloom, recently\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/dylanbeynon\/status\/1891682189550432426\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">wrote<\/a>\u00a0on X, \u201cKetamine is not physically addictive. SSRIs are very difficult to wean off of for many.\u201d (Beynon\u2019s wife, the former head of engineering at Mindbloom,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/futurism.com\/neoscope\/elon-musk-doge-staffer-ketamine\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">now works<\/a>\u00a0at DOGE.) Although ketamine doesn\u2019t lead to the same kind of physical withdrawal symptoms as opioids or alcohol, Morgan, the University of Exeter professor, said its abuse potential is widely accepted, partly because people build a tolerance to the drug very quickly. In the United Kingdom, where health data are more centralized, more than 2,000 people sought treatment for\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/statistics\/substance-misuse-treatment-for-adults-statistics-2022-to-2023\/adult-substance-misuse-treatment-statistics-2022-to-2023-report\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">ketamine addiction<\/a>\u00a0in 2023. More to the point, ketamine\u2019s most dramatic risks depend on simply how much ketamine a person takes, and for how long.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Swaths of the tech world have long been drawn to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en\/article\/the-revival-of-stoicism\/\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">Stoic philosophy<\/a>, which encourages a detachment from that which is out of your control.
