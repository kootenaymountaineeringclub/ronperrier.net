Following a declaration of national sovereignty on 15 October 1991 as the former Yugoslavia began to disintegrate, a\u00a0referendum for independence\u00a0was held on 29 February 1992. The result, in favour of independence, was rejected by the political representatives of the Bosnian Serbs who had boycotted the referendum. The\u00a0Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina\u00a0was formally recognised by the\u00a0European Community\u00a0and the United States in April 1992. Following the declaration of independence, Bosnian Serb forces, supported by the\u00a0Serbian government\u00a0of\u00a0Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107\u00a0and the\u00a0Yugoslav People&#8217;s Army\u00a0(JNA), attacked the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to unify and secure Serb territory. A fierce struggle for territorial control ensued, accompanied by the\u00a0ethnic cleansing\u00a0of the non-Serb population from areas under Serb control; in particular, the Bosniak population of Eastern Bosnia, near the border with Serbia.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1992 ethnic cleansing campaign<br \/>\n<\/strong>The predominantly Bosniak area of Central\u00a0Podrinje\u00a0(the region around Srebrenica) had a primary strategic importance to Serbs, as without it there would be no territorial integrity within their new political entity of\u00a0Republika Srpska.\u00a0They thus proceeded with the\u00a0ethnic cleansing\u00a0of Bosniaks from Bosniak ethnic territories in Eastern Bosnia and Central Podrinje. In the words of the ICTY judgement:<br \/>\nOnce towns and villages were securely in their hands, the Serb forces\u2014the military, the police, the paramilitaries and, sometimes, even Serb villagers\u2014applied the same pattern: Muslim houses and apartments were systematically ransacked or burnt down, Muslim villagers were rounded up or captured and, in the process, sometimes beaten or killed. Men and women were separated, with many of the men detained in the former KP Dom prison.<br \/>\nIn neighbouring\u00a0Bratunac, Bosniaks were either killed or forced to flee to Srebrenica, resulting in 1,156 deaths, according to Bosnian government data.Thousands of Bosniaks were also killed in\u00a0Fo\u010da,\u00a0Zvornik,\u00a0Cerska\u00a0and\u00a0Snagovo.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fate of Bosniak villages<br \/>\n<\/strong>The Bosnian Institute in the UK has published a list of 296 villages destroyed by Serb forces around Srebrenica during the first three months of war (April \u2013 June 1992):<br \/>\nMore than three years before the 1995 Srebrenica genocide, Bosnian Serb nationalists\u2014with the logistical, moral and financial support of Serbia and the Yugoslav People&#8217;s Army (JNA)\u2014destroyed 296 predominantly Bosniak villages in the region around Srebrenica, forcibly uprooting some 70,000 Bosniaks from their homes and systematically massacring at least 3,166 Bosniaks (documented deaths) including many women, children and elderly.<br \/>\nAccording to the\u00a0Naser Ori\u0107\u00a0trial judgement:\u00a0Between April 1992 and March 1993, the town of Srebrenica and the villages in the area held by Bosniak were constantly subjected to Serb military assaults, including artillery attacks, sniper fire, as well as occasional bombing from aircraft. Each onslaught followed a similar pattern. Serb soldiers and paramilitaries surrounded a Bosnian Muslim village or hamlet, called upon the population to surrender their weapons, and then began with indiscriminate shelling and shooting. In most cases, they then entered the village or hamlet, expelled or killed the population, who offered no significant resistance, and destroyed their homes. During this period, Srebrenica was subjected to indiscriminate shelling from all directions on a daily basis. Poto\u010dari in particular was a daily target for Serb artillery and infantry because it was a sensitive point in the defence line around Srebrenica. Other Bosnian Muslim settlements were routinely attacked as well. All this resulted in a great number of refugees and casualties.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Struggle for Srebrenica 1992\u20131993<br \/>\n<\/strong>Serb military and paramilitary forces from the area and neighbouring parts of eastern Bosnia and Serbia gained control of Srebrenica for several weeks in early 1992, killing and expelling Bosniak civilians. In May 1992, Bosnian government forces under the leadership of Ori\u0107 recaptured the town.<br \/>\nOver the remainder of 1992, offensives by Bosnian government forces from Srebrenica increased the area under their control, and by January 1993 they had linked with Bosniak-held\u00a0\u017depa\u00a0to the south and Cerska to the west. At this time, the Srebrenica enclave had reached its peak size of 900 square kilometres (350 sq miles), although it was never linked to the main area of Bosnian-government controlled land in the west and remained, in the words of the ICTY, &#8220;a vulnerable island amid Serb-controlled territory&#8221;. During this time,\u00a0Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina\u00a0(ARBiH) forces under the command of\u00a0Naser Ori\u0107\u00a0used\u00a0Srebrenica\u00a0as a staging ground to attack neighboring Serb villages inflicting many casualties.\u00a0On one occasion in 1993, the village of\u00a0Kravica\u00a0was attacked by ARBIH and resulted in numerous Serb civilian casualties. The actions carried out by the ARBIH under the command of\u00a0Naser Ori\u0107\u00a0were seen as a catalyst for what occurred in Srebrenica in 1995. According to General\u00a0Philippe Morillon&#8217;s testimony at the session of the ICTY 12 February 2004:<br \/>\nOver the next few months, the Serb military captured the villages of Konjevi\u0107 Polje and Cerska, severing the link between Srebrenica and \u017depa and reducing the size of the Srebrenica enclave to 150 square kilometres. Bosniak residents of the outlying areas converged on the town of Srebrenica and its population swelled to between 50,000 and 60,000 people.<br \/>\nGeneral\u00a0Philippe Morillon\u00a0of France, Commander of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), visited Srebrenica in March 1993. By then, the town was overcrowded and\u00a0siege\u00a0conditions prevailed. There was almost no running water as the advancing Serb forces had destroyed the town&#8217;s water supplies; people relied on makeshift generators for electricity. Food, medicine and other essentials were extremely scarce. Before leaving, General Morillon told the panicked residents of Srebrenica at a public gathering that the town was under the protection of the UN and that he would never abandon them.<br \/>\nDuring March and April 1993 several thousand Bosniaks were evacuated from Srebrenica under the auspices of the\u00a0UN High Commissioner for Refugees\u00a0(UNHCR). The evacuations were opposed by the Bosnian government in\u00a0Sarajevo\u00a0as contributing to the ethnic cleansing of predominantly Bosniak territory.<br \/>\nThe Serb authorities remained intent on capturing the enclave. On 13 April 1993, the Serbs told the UNHCR representatives that they would attack the town within two days unless the Bosniaks surrendered and agreed to be evacuated. The Bosniaks refused to surrender.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Starvation in Srebrenica 1992\u20131995<br \/>\n<\/strong>With the failure to demilitarize and lack of supplies getting into the city, Naser Ori\u0107 consolidated his power and controlled the black market. Ori\u0107&#8217;s men began hoarding food, fuel, cigarettes and embezzled money sent by foreign aid agencies to support Muslim orphans.\u00a0Basic necessities were out of reach for many of the people in Srebrenica due to Ori\u0107&#8217;s actions. UN officials were beginning to lose patience with the ARBiH in Srebrenica and saw them as &#8220;criminal gang leaders, pimps and black marketeers&#8221;.<br \/>\nA former Serb soldier of the &#8220;Red Berets&#8221; unit described the tactics used to starve and kill the besieged population of Srebrenica:\u00a0It was almost like a game, a cat-and-mouse hunt. But of course we greatly outnumbered the Muslims, so in almost all cases, we were the hunters and they were the prey. We needed them to surrender, but how do you get someone to surrender in a war like this? You starve them to death. So very quickly we realised that it wasn&#8217;t really weapons being smuggled into Srebrenica that we should worry about, but food. They were truly starving in there, so they would send people out to steal cattle or gather crops, and our job was to find and kill them&#8230; No prisoners. Well, yes, if we thought they had useful information, we might keep them alive until we got it out of them, but in the end, no prisoners&#8230; The local people became quite indignant, so sometimes we would keep someone alive to hand over to them [to kill] just to keep them happy.<br \/>\nWhen Australian journalist Tony Birtley visited the besieged Srebrenica in March 1993, he took footage of Bosniak civilians starving to death.<br \/>\nThe judgment of the Hague Tribunal in the case of Naser Ori\u0107 found that:\u00a0Bosnian Serb forces controlling the access roads were not allowing international humanitarian aid\u2014most importantly, food and medicine\u2014to reach Srebrenica. As a consequence, there was a constant and serious shortage of food causing starvation to peak in the winter of 1992\/1993. Numerous people died or were in an extremely emaciated state due to malnutrition. Bosnian Muslim fighters and their families, however, were provided with food rations from existing storage facilities. The most disadvantaged group among the Bosnian Muslims was that of the refugees, who usually lived on the streets and without shelter, in freezing temperatures. Only in November and December 1992, did two UN convoys with humanitarian aid reach the enclave, and this despite Bosnian Serb obstruction.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Organisation of UNPROFOR and UNPF<\/strong> &#8211; United Nations Protection Force<br \/>\nIn April 1995, UNPROFOR became the name used for the Bosnia regional command of the now-renamed\u00a0United Nations Peace Forces\u00a0(UNPF).\u00a0The 2011 report\u00a0Srebrenica: a &#8216;safe&#8217; area\u00a0says that &#8220;On 12 June 1995 a new command was created under UNPF,\u00a0with &#8220;12,500 British, French and Dutch troops equipped with tanks and high calibre artillery in order to increase the effectiveness and the credibility of the peacekeeping operation&#8221;.\u00a0The report states:\u00a0In the UNPROFOR\u00a0chain of command,\u00a0Dutchbat\u00a0occupied the fourth tier, with the sector commanders occupying the third tier. The fourth tier primarily had an operational task. Within this structure, Dutchbat was expected to operate as an independent unit with its own logistic arrangements. Dutchbat was dependent on the UNPROFOR organization to some extent for crucial supplies such as fuel. For the rest, it was expected to obtain its supplies from the Netherlands. From an organizational point of view, the battalion had two lifelines: UNPROFOR and the Royal Netherlands Army. Dutchbat had been assigned responsibility for the Srebrenica Safe Area. Neither UNPROFOR nor Bosnia-Hercegovina paid much attention to Srebrenica, however. Srebrenica was situated in eastern Bosnia, which was geographically and mentally far removed from Sarajevo and Zagreb. The rest of the world was focused on the fight for Sarajevo and the peace process. As a Safe Area, Srebrenica only occasionally managed to attract the attention of the world press or the UN Security Council. That is why the Dutch troops there remained of secondary importance, in operational and logistic terms, for so long; and why the importance of the enclave in the battle for domination between the Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Muslims failed to be recognised for so long.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Srebrenica &#8220;safe area&#8221;<br \/>\n<\/strong>April 1993: the Security Council declares Srebrenica a &#8220;safe area&#8221;. On 16 April 1993, the\u00a0United Nations Security Council\u00a0passed\u00a0Resolution 819, which demanded that &#8220;all parties and others concerned treat Srebrenica and its surroundings as a\u00a0safe area\u00a0which should be free from any armed attack or any other hostile act&#8221;.\u00a0On 18 April 1993, the first group of UNPROFOR troops arrived in Srebrenica. On 8 May 1993 agreement was reached for demilitarization of Srebrenica. According to UN reports, &#8220;General [Sefer] Halilovi\u0107 and General [Ratko] Mladi\u0107 agreed on measures covering the whole of the Srebrenica enclave and the adjacent enclave of \u017depa. Under the terms of the new agreement, Bosniak forces within the enclave would hand over their weapons, ammunition and mines to UNPROFOR, after which Serb &#8220;heavy weapons and units that constituted a menace to the demilitarised zones which will have been established in \u017depa and Srebrenica will be withdrawn.&#8221; Unlike the earlier agreement, the agreement of 8 May stated specifically that Srebrenica was to be considered a &#8220;demilitarised zone&#8221;, as referred to in article 60 of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I).&#8221;<br \/>\nBetween 1,000 and 2,000 soldiers from three of the VRS Drina Corps\u00a0Brigades\u00a0were deployed around the enclave, equipped with tanks, armoured vehicles, artillery and\u00a0mortars. The 28th Mountain Division of the\u00a0Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) remaining in the enclave was neither well organised nor equipped: a firm command structure and communications system was lacking, and some soldiers carried old hunting rifles or no weapons at all. Few had proper uniforms.<br \/>\nFrom the outset, both parties to the conflict violated the &#8220;safe area&#8221; agreement.\u00a0Lieutenant-Colonel\u00a0Thomas Karremans\u00a0(the\u00a0Dutchbat\u00a0Commander) testified to the ICTY that his personnel were prevented from returning to the enclave by Serb forces and that equipment and ammunition were also prevented from getting in.\u00a0Bosniaks in Srebrenica complained of attacks by Serb soldiers, while to the Serbs it appeared that Bosnian government forces in Srebrenica were using the &#8220;safe area&#8221; as a convenient base from which to launch counter-offensives against the Army of the Republika Srpska (VRS) and that UNPROFOR was failing to take any action to prevent it.\u00a0General\u00a0Sefer Halilovi\u0107admitted that ARBiH helicopters had flown in violation of the no-fly zone and that he had personally dispatched eight helicopters with ammunition for the 28th Division.<\/p>\n<p><strong>United Nations failure to demilitarise Srebrenica<br \/>\n<\/strong>A Security Council mission led by\u00a0Diego Arria\u00a0arrived in Srebrenica on 25 April 1993 and, in their subsequent report to the U.N., condemned the Serbs for perpetrating &#8220;a slow-motion process of genocide.&#8221; The mission then stated that &#8220;Serb forces must withdraw to points from which they cannot attack, harass or terrorise the town. UNPROFOR should be in a position to determine the related parameters. The mission believes, as does UNPROFOR, that the actual 4.5\u00a0km by 0.5\u00a0km decided as a safe area should be greatly expanded.&#8221; Specific instructions from United Nations Headquarters in New York stated that UNPROFOR should not be too zealous in searching for Bosniak weapons and, later, that the Serbs should withdraw their heavy weapons before the Bosniaks gave up their weapons. The Serbs never did withdraw their heavy weapons.<br \/>\nMultiple attempts to demilitarise the ARBiH and force the withdrawal of the VRS proved futile. The ARBiH hid the majority of their heavy weapons, modern equipment and ammunition in the surrounding forest and only handed over disused and old weaponry.\u00a0On the other hand, given the failure to disarm the ARBiH, the VRS refused to withdraw from the front lines given the intelligence they had regarding hidden weaponry.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Early 1995: the situation in the Srebrenica &#8220;safe area&#8221; deteriorates<br \/>\n<\/strong>By early 1995, fewer and fewer supply convoys were making it through to the enclave. The situation in Srebrenica and in other enclaves had deteriorated into lawless violence as prostitution among young Muslim girls, theft and black marketeering proliferated.\u00a0The already meager resources of the civilian population dwindled further, and even the UN forces started running dangerously low on food, medicine, ammunition and fuel, eventually being forced to start patrolling the enclave on foot. Dutch soldiers who left the area on leave were not allowed to return,\u00a0and their number dropped from 600 to 400 men.\u00a0In March and April, the Dutch soldiers noticed a build-up of Serb forces near two of the observation posts, &#8220;OP Romeo&#8221; and &#8220;OP Quebec&#8221;.<br \/>\nIn March 1995,\u00a0Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107, President of the Republika Srpska (RS), despite pressure from the international community to end the war and ongoing efforts to negotiate a peace agreement, issued a directive to the VRS concerning the long-term strategy of the VRS forces in the enclave. The directive, known as &#8220;Directive 7&#8221;, specified that the VRS was to:\u00a0complete the physical separation of Srebrenica from \u017depa as soon as possible, preventing even communication between individuals in the two enclaves. By planned and well-thought-out combat operations, create an unbearable situation of total insecurity with no hope of further survival or life for the inhabitants of Srebrenica.<br \/>\nBy mid-1995, the humanitarian situation of the Bosniak civilians and military personnel in the enclave was catastrophic. In May, following orders, Ori\u0107 and his staff left the enclave by helicopter to\u00a0Tuzla, leaving senior officers in command of the 28th Division. In late June and early July, the 28th Division issued a series of reports including urgent pleas for the\u00a0humanitarian corridor\u00a0to the enclave to be reopened. When this failed, Bosniak civilians began dying from starvation. On Friday, 7 July the mayor of Srebrenica reported that eight residents had died of starvation.<br \/>\nOn 4 June 1995, UNPROFOR commander\u00a0Bernard Janvier, a Frenchman, secretly met with Ratko Mladi\u0107 to obtain the release of hostages, many of whom were French. Mladi\u0107 demanded of Janvier that there would be no more air strikes.<br \/>\nIn the weeks leading up to the assault on Srebrenica by the\u00a0VRS, ARBiH forces were ordered to carry out diversion and disruption attacks on the VRS by high command.\u00a0On one particular occasion on the evening of 25\u201326 June, ARBiH forces attacked VRS units on the\u00a0Sarajevo-Zvornik\u00a0road inflicting high casualties and looting VRS stockpiles. These continued attacks prompted a response from Mladi\u0107, who contacted the UN headquarters in Sarajevo and advised that he would no longer tolerate ARBiH incursions into the Bosnian Serb countryside.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6\u201311 July 1995: Serb take-over of Srebrenica<\/strong> &#8211; Operation Krivaja &#8217;95<br \/>\nThe Serb offensive against Srebrenica began in earnest on 6 July 1995. The\u00a0VRS, with 2,000 soldiers, were outnumbered by the defenders and did not expect the assault to be an easy conquest.\u00a0In the following days, the five UNPROFOR observation posts in the southern part of the enclave fell one by one in the face of the Bosnian Serb advance. Some of the Dutch soldiers retreated into the enclave after their posts were attacked, but the crews of the other observation posts surrendered into Serb custody. Simultaneously, the defending Bosnian forces numbering 6,000 came under heavy fire and were pushed back towards the town. Once the southern perimeter began to collapse, about 4,000 Bosniak residents who had been living in a Swedish housing complex for refugees nearby fled north into the town of Srebrenica. Dutch soldiers reported that the advancing Serbs were &#8220;cleansing&#8221; the houses in the southern part of the enclave.<br \/>\nOn 8 July, a Dutch\u00a0YPR-765\u00a0armoured vehicle took fire from the Serbs and withdrew. A group of Bosniaks demanded that the armoured vehicle stay to defend them, and established a makeshift barricade to prevent its retreat. As the armoured vehicle continued to withdraw, a Bosniak farmer who was manning the barricade threw a hand grenade onto it and subsequently killed Dutch soldier Raviv van Renssen.\u00a0Late on 9 July 1995, emboldened by early successes and little resistance from the largely demilitarised Bosniaks as well as the absence of any significant reaction from the international community, President Karad\u017ei\u0107 issued a new order authorising the 1,500-strong\u00a0VRS Drina Corps to capture the town of Srebrenica.<br \/>\nThe following morning, 10 July 1995, Lieutenant-Colonel Karremans made urgent requests for air support from\u00a0North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u00a0(NATO) to defend Srebrenica as crowds filled the streets, some of whom carried weapons. VRS tanks were approaching the town, and NATO airstrikes on these began on the afternoon of 11 July 1995. NATO bombers attempted to attack VRS artillery locations outside the town, but poor visibility forced NATO to cancel this operation. Further NATO air attacks were cancelled after VRS threats to bomb the UN&#8217;s Poto\u010dari compound, to kill Dutch and French military hostages and to attack surrounding locations where 20,000 to 30,000 civilian refugees were situated.<br \/>\nLate in the afternoon of 11 July, General Mladi\u0107, accompanied by General \u017divanovi\u0107 (then-Commander of the Drina Corps), General Krsti\u0107 (then-Deputy Commander and Chief of Staff of the Drina Corps) and other VRS officers, took a triumphant walk through the deserted streets of the town of Srebrenica.<br \/>\nIn the evening, Lieutenant-Colonel\u00a0Thom Karremans\u00a0was filmed drinking a toast with General Mladi\u0107 during the bungled negotiations on the fate of the civilian population grouped in Poto\u010dari.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MASSACRE<\/strong><br \/>\nThe two highest ranking Serb politicians from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Karad\u017ei\u0107 and\u00a0Mom\u010dilo Kraji\u0161nik, both indicted for genocide, were warned by military commander General Mladi\u0107 (found guilty of genocide at a UN Tribunal in November 2017) that their plans could not be realised without committing genocide. Mladi\u0107 said:\u00a0People are not little stones, or keys in someone&#8217;s pocket, that can be moved from one place to another just like that&#8230;. Therefore, we cannot precisely arrange for only Serbs to stay in one part of the country while removing others painlessly. I do not know how Mr. Kraji\u0161nik and Mr. Karad\u017ei\u0107 will explain that to the world. That is genocide.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Increasing concentration of refugees in Poto\u010dari<br \/>\n<\/strong>By the evening of 11 July 1995, approximately 20,000 to 25,000 Bosniak refugees from Srebrenica were gathered in Poto\u010dari, seeking protection within the\u00a0UNPROFOR\u00a0Dutchbat headquarters. Several thousand had pressed inside the compound itself, while the rest were spread throughout the neighbouring factories and fields. Although the vast majority were women, children, elderly or disabled, 63 witnesses estimated that there were at least 300 men inside the perimeter of the UNPROFOR compound and between 600 and 900 men in the crowd outside.\u00a0UNPROFOR Dutchbat soldiers [on site] claimed\u00a0their base was full.<br \/>\nConditions in Poto\u010dari included &#8220;little food or water available&#8221; and sweltering heat. One UNPROFOR Dutchbat officer described the scene as follows:\u00a0They were panicked, they were scared, and they were pressing each other against the soldiers, my soldiers, the UN soldiers that tried to calm them. People that fell were trampled on. It was a chaotic situation.<br \/>\nOn 12 July, the United Nations Security Council, in\u00a0Resolution 1004, expressed concern at the humanitarian situation in Poto\u010dari, which also condemned the offensive by Bosnian Serb forces and demanded immediate withdrawal.<br \/>\nOn 13 July, the Dutch forces expelled five Bosniak refugees from the United Nations compound despite knowing that men outside the compound were being killed and abused.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Crimes committed in Poto\u010dari<br \/>\n<\/strong>On 12 July 1995, as the day wore on, the refugees in the compound could see VRS soldiers setting houses and haystacks on fire. Throughout the afternoon, Serb soldiers mingled in the crowd and\u00a0summary executions\u00a0of men occurred.\u00a0In the late morning of 12 July a witness saw a pile of 20 to 30 bodies heaped up behind the Transport Building in Poto\u010dari, alongside a tractor-like machine. Another testified that he saw a soldier slay a child with a knife in the middle of a crowd of expellees. He also said that he saw Serb soldiers execute more than a hundred Bosnian Muslim men in the area behind the Zinc Factory and then load their bodies onto a truck, although the number and nature of the murders stand in contrast to other evidence in the Trial Record, which indicates that the killings in Poto\u010dari were sporadic in nature. Soldiers were picking people out of the crowd and taking them away. A witness recounted how three brothers\u2014one merely a child and the others in their teens\u2014were taken out in the night. When the boys&#8217; mother went looking for them, she found them stark naked and with their throats slit.\u00a0That night, a Dutchbat medical orderly witnessed two Serb soldiers raping a young woman.<br \/>\nOne survivor described the murder of a baby and the rape of women occurring in the close vicinity of Dutch U.N. peacekeepers who did nothing to prevent it. According to the survivor, a Serb told a mother to make her child stop crying, and when it continued to cry he took it and slit its throat, after which he laughed.\u00a0Stories about rapes and killings spread through the crowd and the terror in the camp escalated.\u00a0Several individuals were so terrified that they committed suicide by hanging themselves.<br \/>\nOne of the survivors, Zarfa Turkovi\u0107, described the horrors of rapes as follows: &#8220;Two [Serb soldiers] took her legs and raised them up in the air, while the third began raping her. Four of them were taking turns on her. People were silent, no one moved. She was screaming and yelling and begging them to stop. They put a rag into her mouth and then we just heard silent sobs&#8230;.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Separation and murder of Bosniak men and boys in Poto\u010dari<br \/>\n<\/strong>From the morning of 12 July, Serb forces began gathering men and boys from the refugee population in Poto\u010dari and holding them in separate locations, and as the refugees began boarding the buses headed north towards Bosniak-held territory, Serb soldiers separated out men of military age who were trying to clamber aboard. Occasionally, younger and older men were stopped as well (some as young as 14 or 15).\u00a0These men were taken to a building in Poto\u010dari referred to as the &#8220;White House&#8221;. As early as the evening of 12 July 1995, Major Franken of the Dutchbat heard that no men were arriving with the women and children at their destination in\u00a0Kladanj.\u00a0At this time, the UNHCR Director of Operations, Peter Walsh, was dispatched to Srebrenica by the UNHCR Chief of Mission, Damaso Feci, to evaluate what emergency aid could be provided rapidly. Peter Walsh and his team arrived at Gostilj, just outside Srebrenica, in the early afternoon only to be turned away by VRS forces. Despite claiming freedom of movement rights, the UNHCR team was not allowed to proceed and was forced to head back north to Bijelina. Throughout this time, Peter Walsh relayed reports back to UNHCR in Zagreb about the unfolding situation including witnessing the enforced movement and abuse of Muslim men and boys and the sound of summary executions taking place.<br \/>\nOn 13 July 1995, Dutchbat troops witnessed definite signs that the Serb soldiers were murdering some of the Bosniak men who had been separated. For example, Corporal Vaasen saw two soldiers take a man behind the &#8220;White House&#8221;, heard a shot and saw the two soldiers reappear alone. Another Dutchbat officer saw Serb soldiers murder an unarmed man with a single gunshot to the head and heard gunshots 20\u201340 times an hour throughout the afternoon. When the Dutchbat soldiers told Colonel Joseph Kingori, a\u00a0United Nations Military Observer\u00a0(UNMO) in the Srebrenica area, that men were being taken behind the &#8220;White House&#8221; and not coming back, Colonel Kingori went to investigate. He heard gunshots as he approached, but was stopped by Serb soldiers before he could find out what was going on.<br \/>\nSome of the executions were carried out at night under arc lights, and bulldozers then pushed the bodies into mass graves.\u00a0According to evidence collected from Bosniaks by French policeman Jean-Ren\u00e9 Ruez, some were buried alive; he also heard testimony describing Serb forces killing and torturing refugees at will, streets littered with corpses, people committing suicide to avoid having their noses, lips and ears chopped off, and adults being forced to watch the soldiers kill their children.<\/p>\n<p><strong>RAPE AND ABUSE OF CIVILIANS<br \/>\n<\/strong>Thousands of women and girls suffered rape and sexual abuse and other forms of torture. According to the testimony of Zumra \u0160ehomerovic:\u00a0The Serbs began at a certain point to take girls and young women out of the group of refugees. They were raped. The rapes often took place under the eyes of others and sometimes even under the eyes of the children of the mother. A Dutch soldier stood by and he simply looked around with a\u00a0Walkman\u00a0on his head. He did not react at all to what was happening. It did not happen just before my eyes, for I saw that personally, but also before the eyes of us all. The Dutch soldiers walked around everywhere. It is impossible that they did not see it.<br \/>\nThere was a woman with a small baby a few months old. A\u00a0Chetnik\u00a0told the mother that the child must stop crying. When the child did not stop crying, he snatched the child away and cut its throat. Then he laughed. There was a Dutch soldier there who was watching. He did not react at all.<br \/>\nI saw yet more frightful things. For example, there was a girl, she must have been about nine years old. At a certain moment some Chetniks recommended to her brother that he rape the girl. He did not do it and I also think that he could not have done it for he was still just a child. Then they murdered that young boy. I have personally seen all that. I really want to emphasize that all this happened in the immediate vicinity of the base. In the same way I also saw other people who were murdered. Some of them had their throats cut. Others were\u00a0beheaded.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Testimony of Ramiza Gurdi\u0107:\u00a0<\/strong>I saw how a young boy of about ten was killed by Serbs in Dutch uniform. This happened in front of my own eyes. The mother sat on the ground and her young son sat beside her. The young boy was placed on his mother&#8217;s lap. The young boy was killed. His head was cut off. The body remained on the lap of the mother. The Serbian soldier placed the head of the young boy on his knife and showed it to everyone. \u2026 I saw how a pregnant woman was slaughtered. There were Serbs who stabbed her in the stomach, cut her open and took two small children out of her stomach and then beat them to death on the ground. I saw this with my own eyes.<br \/>\n<strong>Testimony of Kada Hoti\u0107:\u00a0<\/strong>There was a young woman with a baby on the way to the bus. The baby cried and a Serbian soldier told her that she had to make sure that the baby was quiet. Then the soldier took the child from the mother and cut its throat. I do not know whether Dutchbat soldiers saw that. \u2026 There was a sort of fence on the left-hand side of the road to Potocari. I heard then a young woman screaming very close by (4 or 5 meters away). I then heard another woman beg: &#8220;Leave her, she is only nine years old.&#8221; The screaming suddenly stopped. I was so in shock that I could scarcely move. \u2026 The rumour later quickly circulated that a nine year old girl had been raped.<br \/>\nThat night, a DutchBat medical orderly came across two Serb soldiers raping a young woman:<br \/>\nWe saw two Serb soldiers, one of them was standing guard and the other one was lying on the girl, with his pants off. And we saw a girl lying on the ground, on some kind of mattress. There was blood on the mattress, even she was covered with blood. She had bruises on her legs. There was even blood coming down her legs. She was in total shock. She went totally crazy.<br \/>\nBosnian Muslim refugees nearby could see the rape, but could do nothing about it because of Serb soldiers standing nearby. Other people heard women screaming, or saw women being dragged away. Several individuals were so terrified that they committed suicide by hanging themselves. Throughout the night and early the next morning, stories about the rapes and killings spread through the crowd and the terror in the camp escalated.<br \/>\nScreams, gunshots and other frightening noises were audible throughout the night and no one could sleep. Soldiers were picking people out of the crowd and taking them away: some returned; others did not. Witness T recounted how three brothers\u2014one merely a child and the others in their teens\u2014were taken out in the night. When the boys&#8217; mother went looking for them, she found them with their throats slit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DEPORTATION OF WOMEN<br \/>\n<\/strong>As a result of exhaustive UN negotiations with Serb troops, around 25,000 Srebrenica women were forcibly transferred to the Bosniak-controlled territory.\u00a0Some buses apparently never reached safety. According to a witness account given by Kadir Habibovi\u0107, who hid himself on one of the first buses from the base in Poto\u010dari to Kladanj, he saw at least one vehicle full of Bosniak women being driven away from Bosnian government-held territory.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Column of Bosniak men<br \/>\n<\/strong>On the evening of 11 July 1995, word spread through the Bosniak community that able-bodied men should take to the woods, form a\u00a0column\u00a0together with members of the ARBiH&#8217;s 28th Division and attempt a breakthrough towards Bosnian government-held territory in the north.\u00a0The men believed they stood a better chance of surviving by trying to escape than if they let themselves fall into Serb hands.<br \/>\nAround 10\u00a0pm on 11 July the Division command, together with the municipal authorities, took the decision, on their own initiative, to form a column and leave the safe area in an attempt to reach government-controlled territory around Tuzla.\u00a0Dehydration made finding drinking water a major problem, along with lack of sleep and physical exhaustion\u2014many were exhausted before setting out. There was little cohesion or sense of common purpose in the column. Along the way, the column was shelled and ambushed. In severe mental distress, some of the refugees killed themselves. Others were induced to surrender. Survivors claimed they were attacked with a chemical agent that caused hallucinations, disorientation and strange behaviour. Infiltrators in civilian clothing confused, attacked and killed refugees, including the wounded.\u00a0Many of those taken prisoner were killed on the spot. Others were collected together before being taken to remote locations for mass execution.<br \/>\nThe attacks on the column broke it up into smaller segments. Only about one third of the men succeeded in crossing the asphalt road between\u00a0Konjevi\u0107 Polje\u00a0and\u00a0Nova Kasaba. It was this group that eventually crossed Bosnian Serb lines to reach Bosnian government territory on and after 16 July. The vast majority of the victims of the massacre were members of the column who failed to complete the perilous journey.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Other groups<br \/>\n<\/strong>A second, smaller group of refugees (estimated at between 700 and 800) attempted to escape into Serbia via Mount Kvarac via Bratunac, or across the river\u00a0Drina\u00a0and via\u00a0Bajina Ba\u0161ta. It is not known how many were intercepted, arrested and killed on the way. A third group headed for \u017depa, possibly having first tried to reach Tuzla. The estimates of the numbers involved vary widely, from 300 to around 850. In addition, small pockets of resistance apparently remained behind and engaged Serb forces.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tuzla column departs<br \/>\n<\/strong>Almost all the 28th Division, 5500 to 6000 soldiers, not all armed, gathered in the village of \u0160u\u0161njari, in the hills north of the town of Srebrenica, along with about 7,000 civilians. They included a very small number of women, not more than ten.\u00a0Others assembled in the nearby village of Jagli\u0107i.<br \/>\nAt around midnight on 11 July 1995, the column started moving along the axis between Konjevi\u0107 Polje and Bratunac. The main column was preceded by a reconnaissance party of four scouts, approximately five kilometres ahead.\u00a0Members of the column walked one behind the other, following the paper trail laid down by a de-mining unit.<br \/>\nThe column was led by a group of 50\u2013100 of the best soldiers from each brigade, carrying the best available equipment. Elements of the 284th Brigade were followed by the 280th Brigade, with them the Chief of Staff Ramiz Be\u0107irovi\u0107. Civilians accompanied by other soldiers followed, and at the back was the independent battalion which was part of the 28th Division.\u00a0The elite of the enclave, including the mother and sister of Naser Ori\u0107,\u00a0accompanied the best troops at the front of the column.\u00a0Others in the column included the political leaders of the enclave, medical staff of the local hospital and the families of prominent persons in Srebrenica. A small number of women, children and elderly travelled with the column in the woods.\u00a0Each brigade was responsible for a group of refugees, and many civilians joined the military units spontaneously as the journey got underway. The column was between 12 and 15 kilometres long, about two and a half hours separating head from tail.<br \/>\nThe breakout from the enclave and the attempt to reach Tuzla came as a surprise to the VRS and caused considerable confusion, as the VRS had expected the men to go to Poto\u010dari. Serb general\u00a0Milan Gvero\u00a0in a briefing referred to members of the column as &#8220;hardened and violent criminals who will stop at nothing to prevent being taken prisoner and to enable their escape into Bosnian territory&#8221;.\u00a0The Drina Corps and the various brigades were ordered by the VRS Main Staff to assign all available manpower to the task of finding any Muslim groups observed, preventing them from crossing into Muslim territory, taking them prisoner and holding them in buildings that could be secured by small forces.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ambush at Kamenica Hill<br \/>\n<\/strong>During the night, poor visibility, fear of mines and panic induced by artillery fire split the column in two.<br \/>\nOn the afternoon of 12 July, the front section emerged from the woods and crossed the asphalt road from Konjevi\u0107 Polje and Nova Kasaba. Around 18.00 hours, the RS Army located the main part of the column still in the hilly area around Kamenica (outside the village of\u00a0Pobu\u0111e). Around 20.00 hours this part of the column, led by the municipal authorities and the wounded, started descending Kamenica Hill (44\u00b019\u203253\u2033N\u00a018\u00b014\u20325\u2033E) towards the road. After a few dozen men had crossed, soldiers of the RS Army arrived from the direction of\u00a0Kravica\u00a0in trucks and armoured vehicles including a white vehicle with UNPROFOR symbols, calling out for Bosniaks over the loudspeaker to surrender.<br \/>\nIt was around this time that yellow smoke was observed, followed by observations of strange behaviour, including suicides, hallucinations and members of the column attacking one another.\u00a0Numerous survivors interviewed by Human Rights Watch claimed they were attacked with a chemical agent that caused hallucinations and disorientation.(Gen. Zdravko Tolimir was an advocate of the use of chemical weapons against the ArBiH.<br \/>\nHeavy shooting and shelling began, which continued into the night. The armed members of the column returned fire and all scattered. Survivors describe a group of at least 1000 engaged at close range by small arms. Hundreds appear to have been killed as they fled the open area and some were said to have killed themselves to escape capture.<br \/>\nRS Army and Ministry of Interior persuaded members of the column to surrender by promising them protection and safe transportation towards Tuzla under UNPROFOR and Red Cross supervision. Appropriated UN and Red Cross equipment was used to deceive the refugees into believing the promises. Surrendering prisoners&#8217; personal belongings were confiscated and some were executed on the spot.<br \/>\nThe rear of the column lost contact with the front and panic broke out. Many people remained in the Kamenica Hill area for a number of days, unable to move on with the escape route blocked by Serb forces. Thousands of Bosniaks surrendered or were captured. Some prisoners were ordered to summon friends and family members from the woods. There were reports of Serb forces using megaphones to call on the marchers to surrender, telling them that they would be exchanged for Serb soldiers held captive by Bosniak forces. It was at Kamenica that VRS personnel in civilian dress were reported to have infiltrated the column. Men from the rear of the column who survived this ordeal described it as a manhunt.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sandi\u0107i massacre<br \/>\n<\/strong>Close to Sandi\u0107i, on the main road from Bratunac to Konjevi\u0107 Polje, one witness describes the Serbs forcing a Bosniak man to call other Bosniaks down from the mountains. Some 200 to 300 men, including the witness&#8217; brother, followed his instructions and descended to meet the VRS, presumably expecting some exchange of prisoners would take place. The witness hid behind a tree to see what would happen next. He watched as the men were lined up in seven ranks, each some forty metres in length, with their hands behind their heads; they were then mowed down by machine gun fire.<br \/>\nA small number of women, children and elderly people who had been part of the column were allowed to join the buses evacuating the women and children out of Poto\u010dari. Among them was Alma Delimustafi\u0107, a soldier of the 28th Brigade; at this time, Delimustafi\u0107 was in her civilian clothes and was released.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Trek to Mount Udr\u010d<br \/>\n<\/strong>The central section of the column managed to escape the shooting and reached Kamenica at about 11.00 hours and waited there for the wounded.\u00a0Captain\u00a0Ejub Goli\u0107 and the Independent Battalion turned back towards Hajdu\u010dko Groblje to help the casualties. A number of survivors from the rear, who managed to escape crossed the asphalt roads to the north or the west of the area, had joined those in the central section of the column. The front third of the column, which had already left Kamenica Hill by the time the ambush occurred, headed for Mount Udr\u010d (44\u00b016\u203259\u2033N\u00a019\u00b03\u20326\u2033E); crossing the main asphalt road, they then forded the river Jadar. They reached the base of the mountain early on the morning of Thursday, 13 July and regrouped. At first, it was decided to send 300 ARBiH soldiers back in an attempt to break through the blockades. When reports came in that the central section of the column had nevertheless succeeded in crossing the road at Konjevi\u0107 Polje, this plan was abandoned. Approximately 1,000 additional men managed to reach Udr\u010d that night.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Snagovo ambush<br \/>\n<\/strong>From Udr\u010d the marchers moved toward the River Drinja\u010da and on to Mount Velja Glava, continuing through the night. Finding a Serb presence at Mount Velja Glava, where they arrived on Friday, 14 July, the column was forced to skirt the mountain and wait on its slopes before it was able to move on toward\u00a0Liplje\u00a0and Mar\u010di\u0107i. Arriving at Mar\u010di\u0107i in the evening of 14 July, the marchers were again ambushed near Snagovo by Serb forces equipped with anti-aircraft guns, artillery, and tanks.<br \/>\nAccording to Lieutenant D\u017eemail Be\u0107irovi\u0107, the column managed to break through the ambush and, in so doing, captured a VRS officer, Major Zoran Jankovi\u0107\u2014providing the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina with a significant bargaining counter. This prompted an attempt at negotiating a cessation in the fighting, but negotiations with local Serb forces failed.\u00a0Nevertheless, the act of repulsing the ambush had a positive effect on morale of the marchers, who also captured an amount of weapons and supplies.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Approaching the frontline<br \/>\n<\/strong>The evening of 15 July saw the first radio contact between the 2nd Corps and the 28th Division, established using a\u00a0walkie-talkie\u00a0captured from the VRS. After initial distrust on the part of the 28th Division, the brothers \u0160abi\u0107 were able to identify each other as they stood on either side of the VRS lines. Early in the morning, the column crossed the asphalt road linking Zvornik with Caparde and headed in the direction of Planinci, leaving a unit of some 100 to 200 armed marchers behind to wait for stragglers.<br \/>\nThe column reached Kri\u017eevi\u0107i later that day, and remained there while an attempt was made to negotiate with local Serb forces for safe passage through the Serb lines into Bosnian government controlled territory. The members of the column were advised to stay where they were, and to allow the Serb forces time to arrange for safe passage. It soon became apparent, though, that the small Serb force deployed in the area was only trying to gain time to organise a further attack on the marchers. In the area of Mar\u010di\u0107i &#8211; Crni Vrh, the RS armed forces deployed 500 soldiers and policemen in order to stop the split part of the column (about 2,500 people), which was moving from Glodi towards Mar\u010di\u0107i.<br \/>\nAt this point, the column&#8217;s leaders decided to form several small groups of between 100 and 200 persons and send these to reconnoiter the way ahead. Early in the afternoon, the 2nd Corps and the 28th Division of the ARBiH met each other in the village of Poto\u010dani. The presidium of Srebrenica were the first to reach Bosnian terrain.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Breakthrough at Baljkovica<br \/>\n<\/strong>The hillside at Baljkovica (44\u00b027\u2032N\u00a018\u00b058\u2032E) formed the last VRS line separating the column from Bosnian-held territory. The VRS cordon actually consisted of two lines, the first of which presented a front on the Tuzla side against the 2nd Corps and the other a front against the approaching 28th Division.<br \/>\nOn the evening of 15 July a heavy hailstorm caused the Serb forces to take cover. The column&#8217;s advance group took advantage of this to attack the Serb rear lines at Baljkovica. During the fighting, the main body of what remained of the column began to move from Krizevici. It reached the area of fighting at about 3\u00a0am on Sunday, 16 July.<br \/>\nAt approximately 05.00 hours on 16 July, the 2nd Corps made its first attempt to break through the VRS cordon from the Bosnian side. The objective was to force a breakthrough close to the hamlets of Parlog and Resnik. They were joined by Naser Ori\u0107 and a number of his men.<br \/>\nAround 8\u00a0am on the morning of 16 July parts of the 28th Division, with the 2nd Corps of the RBiH Army from Tuzla providing artillery support, attacked and breached RS Army lines. There was fierce fighting across the general area of Baljkovica.<br \/>\nCaptured heavy arms including two Praga\u00a0self-propelled anti-aircraft\u00a0guns were fired at the Serb front line and the column finally succeeded in breaking through to Bosnian government controlled territory and linking up with BiH units at between 1\u00a0pm and 2\u00a0pm on 16 July.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Baljkovica corridor<br \/>\n<\/strong>Following radio negotiations between the 2nd Corps and the Zvornik Brigade, the Zvornik Brigade Command, which had lost three lines of trenches, agreed to open a corridor to allow &#8220;evacuation&#8221; of the column in return for the release of captured policemen and soldiers. The Baljkovica corridor was open from 14.00 to 17.00 hours.<br \/>\nAfter the corridor was closed between 17.00 and 18.00 hours the Zvornik Brigade Command reported that around 5000 civilians, with probably &#8220;a certain number of soldiers&#8221; with them had been let through, but &#8220;all those who passed were unarmed&#8221;.<br \/>\nArrival at TuzlaBy 4 August or thereabouts, the ArBiH determined that 3,175 members of the 28th Division had managed to get through to Tuzla. 2,628 members of the Division, soldiers and officers, were considered certain to have been killed. The approximate number of individual members of the column killed was estimated at between 8,300 and 9,722.<\/p>\n<p><strong>After the closure of the corridor<br \/>\n<\/strong>Once the corridor had closed Serb forces recommenced hunting down parts of the column still in areas under their control. Around 2,000 refugees were reported to be hiding in the woods in the area of Pobudje.<br \/>\nOn 17 July 1995, &#8220;searching the terrain&#8221;, the RS Army captured a number of Bosniaks. Four children aged between 8 and 14 captured by the Bratunac Brigade were taken to the military barracks in Bratunac.\u00a0When one of them described seeing a large number of ARBiH soldiers committing suicide and shooting at each other, Brigade Commander Blagojevi\u0107 suggested that the Drina Corps&#8217; press unit should record this testimony on video.\u00a0The fate of the boys remains uncertain.<br \/>\nOn 18 July, after a soldier was killed &#8220;trying to capture some persons during the search operation&#8221;, the Zvornik Brigade Command issued an order to execute prisoners in its zone of responsibility in order to avoid any risks associated with their capture. The order was presumed to have remained effective until it was countermanded on 21 July.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mass hysteria<br \/>\n<\/strong>According to a 1998\u00a0qualitative study\u00a0involving survivors of the column, many of the members of the column exhibited symptoms of hallucinations to varying degrees.\u00a0On a number of occasions, Bosniak men began attacking one another in an apparent fear that the other member in the column was a Serb soldier. Members of the column also reported seeing people speaking incoherently, running towards VRS lines in a fit of rage and also, men committing suicide using firearms and hand grenades. Although there was no evidence to suggest what exactly caused the mass hallucinations, the study suggested that fatigue and stress may have induced these symptoms.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Plan to execute the men of Srebrenica<br \/>\n<\/strong>Although Serb forces had long been blamed for the massacre, it was not until June 2004\u2014following the Srebrenica commission&#8217;s preliminary report\u2014that Serb officials acknowledged that their security forces planned and carried out the mass killing. A Serb commission&#8217;s final report on the 1995 Srebrenica massacre acknowledged that the\u00a0mass murder\u00a0of the men and boys was planned. The commission found that more than 7,800 were killed after it compiled thirty-four\u00a0lists of victims.<br \/>\nA concerted effort was made to capture all Bosniak men of military age.\u00a0In fact, those captured included many boys well below that age and elderly men several years above that age who remained in the enclave following the take-over of Srebrenica. These men and boys were targeted regardless of whether they chose to flee to Poto\u010dari or to join the Bosnian Muslim column. The operation to capture and detain the Bosnian Muslim men was well organised and comprehensive. The buses which transported the women and children were systematically searched for men.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MASS EXECTIONS<br \/>\n<\/strong>The vast amount of planning and high-level coordination invested in killing thousands of men in a few days is apparent from the scale and the methodical nature in which the executions were carried out. A concerted effort was made to capture all Bosniak men of military age. In fact, those captured included many boys well below that age and elderly men above it.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Army of Republika Srpska\u00a0took the largest number of prisoners on 13 July, along the Bratunac-Konjevi\u0107 Polje road. It remains impossible to cite a precise figure, but witness statements describe the assembly points such as the field at Sandi\u0107i, the agricultural\u00a0warehouses\u00a0in Kravica, the school in Konjevi\u0107 Polje, the\u00a0football field\u00a0in Nova Kasaba, the village of Loli\u0107i and the village school of Luke. Several thousands of people were herded together in the field near Sandi\u0107i and on the Nova Kasaba football pitch, where they were searched and put into smaller groups. In a video tape made by journalist Zoran Petrovi\u0107, a Serb soldier states that at least 3,000 to 4,000 men had given themselves up on the road. By the late afternoon of 13 July, the total had risen to some 6,000 according to the intercepted radio communication; the following day, Major Franken of Dutchbat was given the same figure by Colonel Radislav Jankovi\u0107 of the Serb army. Many of the prisoners had been seen in the locations described by passing convoys taking the women and children to Kladanj by bus, while various aerial photographs have since provided evidence to confirm this version of events.<br \/>\nOne hour after the evacuation of the females from Poto\u010dari was completed, the Drina Corps staff diverted the buses to the areas in which the men were being held. Colonel Krsmanovi\u0107, who on 12 July had arranged the buses for the evacuation, ordered the 700 men in Sandi\u0107i to be collected, and the soldiers guarding them made them throw their possessions on a large heap and hand over anything of value. During the afternoon, the group in Sandi\u0107i was visited by Mladi\u0107 who told them that they would come to no harm, that they would be treated as prisoners of war, that they would be exchanged for other prisoners and that their families had been escorted to Tuzla in safety. Some of these men were placed on the transport to Bratunac and other locations, while some were marched on foot to the warehouses in Kravica. The men gathered on the soccer ground at Nova Kasaba were forced to hand over their personal belongings. They too received a personal visit from Mladi\u0107 during the afternoon of 13 July; on this occasion, he announced that the Bosnian authorities in Tuzla did not want the men and that they were therefore to be taken to other locations. The men in Nova Kasaba were loaded onto buses and trucks and were taken to Bratunac or the other locations.<br \/>\nThe Bosnian men who had been separated from the women, children and elderly in Poto\u010dari numbering approximately 1,000 were transported to Bratunac and subsequently joined by Bosnian men captured from the column.\u00a0Almost without exception, the thousands of Bosnian prisoners captured, following the take-over of Srebrenica, were executed. Some were killed individually or in small groups by the soldiers who captured them and some were killed in the places where they were temporarily detained. Most, however, were killed in carefully orchestrated mass executions, commencing on 13 July 1995 in the region just north of Srebrenica.<br \/>\nThe mass executions followed a well-established pattern. The men were first taken to empty schools or warehouses. After being detained there for some hours, they were loaded onto buses or trucks and taken to another site for execution. Usually, the execution fields were in isolated locations. The prisoners were unarmed and in many cases, steps had been taken to minimise resistance, such as\u00a0blindfolding\u00a0them, binding their wrists behind their backs with ligatures or removing their shoes. Once at the killing fields, the men were taken off the trucks in small groups, lined up and shot. Those who survived the initial round of shooting were individually shot with an extra round, though sometimes only after they had been left to suffer for a time.<br \/>\nThe process of finding victim bodies in the Srebrenica region, often in mass graves,\u00a0exhuming\u00a0them and finally identifying them was relatively slow.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Morning of 13 July: Jadar River.\u00a0<\/strong>A small-scale execution took place prior to midday at the Jadar River on 13 July. Seventeen men were transported by bus a short distance to a spot on the banks of the Jadar River. The men were then lined up and shot. One man, after being hit in the hip by a bullet, jumped into the river and managed to escape.<br \/>\n<strong>Afternoon of 13 July: Cerska Valley.\u00a0<\/strong>The first large-scale mass executions began on the afternoon of 13 July 1995 in the valley of the River Cerska, to the west of Konjevi\u0107 Polje. One witness, hidden among trees, saw two or three trucks, followed by an armoured vehicle and an earthmoving machine proceeding towards Cerska. After that, he heard gunshots for half an hour and then saw the armoured vehicle going in the opposite direction, but not the earthmoving machine. Other witnesses report seeing a pool of blood alongside the road to Cerska that day. Muhamed Durakovi\u0107, a UN translator, probably passed this execution site later that day. He reports seeing bodies tossed into a ditch alongside the road, with some men still alive.<br \/>\nAerial photos and excavations later confirmed the presence of a mass grave near this location. Ammunition cartridges found at the scene reveal that the victims were lined up on one side of the road, whereupon their executioners shot from the other. The bodies\u2014150 in number\u2014were covered with earth where they lay. It could later be established that they had been killed by guns. All were men, between the ages of 14 and 50. All but three of the 150 were wearing civilian clothes. Many had their hands tied behind their backs. Nine could later be identified and were indeed on the list of missing persons from Srebrenica.<br \/>\n<strong>Late afternoon of 13 July: Kravica.\u00a0<\/strong>Later that same afternoon, 13 July 1995 executions were also conducted in the largest of four warehouses (farm sheds) owned by the Agricultural Cooperative in Kravica. Between 1,000 and 1,500 men had been captured in fields near Sandi\u0107i and detained in Sandi\u0107i Meadow. They were brought to Kravica, either by bus or on foot, the distance being approximately one kilometer. A witness recalls seeing around 200 men, stripped to the waist and with their hands in the air, being forced to run in the direction of Kravica. An aerial photograph taken at 14:00 hours that afternoon shows two buses standing in front of the sheds.<br \/>\nAt around 18:00 hours, when the men were all being held in the warehouse, VRS soldiers threw in\u00a0hand grenades\u00a0and shot with various weapons, including\u00a0rocket propelled grenades. The mass murder in Kravica seemed &#8220;well organised and involved a substantial amount of planning, requiring the participation of the Drina Corps Command.\u201d<br \/>\nSupposedly, there was more killing in and around Kravica and Sandi\u0107i. Even before the murders in the warehouse, some 200 or 300 men were formed up in ranks near Sandi\u0107i and then were executed en masse with concentrated machine guns. At Kravica, it seems that the local population had a hand in the killings. Some victims were mutilated and killed with knives. The bodies were taken to Bratunac or simply dumped in the river that runs alongside the road. One witness states that this all took place on 14 July. There were three survivors of the mass murder in the farm sheds at Kravica.<br \/>\nArmed guards shot at the men who tried to climb out the windows to escape the massacre. When the shooting stopped, the shed was full of bodies. Another survivor, who was only slightly wounded, reports:\u00a0I was not even able to touch the floor, the concrete floor of the warehouse&#8230;. After the shooting, I felt a strange kind of heat, warmth, which was coming from the blood that covered the concrete floor and I was stepping on the dead people who were lying around. But there were even men (just men) who were still alive, who were only wounded and as soon as I would step on him, I would hear him cry, moan, because I was trying to move as fast as I could. I could tell that people had been completely disembodied and I could feel bones of the people that had been hit by those bursts of bullets or shells, I could feel their ribs crushing. Then I would get up again and continue&#8230;.<br \/>\nWhen this witness climbed out of a window, he was seen by a guard who shot at him. He then pretended to be dead and managed to escape the following morning. The other witness quoted above spent the night under a heap of bodies; the next morning, he watched as the soldiers examined the corpses for signs of life. The few survivors were forced to sing Serbian songs, and were then shot. Once the final victim had been killed, an excavator was driven in to shunt the bodies out of the shed; the asphalt outside was then hosed down with water. In September 1996, however, it was still possible to find the evidence.<br \/>\nAnalyses of hair, blood and explosives residue collected at the Kravica Warehouse provide strong evidence of the killings. Experts determined the presence of bullet strikes, explosives residue, bullets and shell cases, as well as human blood, bones and tissue adhering to the walls and floors of the building. Forensic evidence presented by the ICTY Prosecutor established a link between the executions in Kravica and the &#8216;primary&#8217; mass grave known as Glogova 2, in which the remains of 139 people were found. In the &#8216;secondary&#8217; grave known as Zeleni Jadar 5 there were 145 bodies, a number of which were charred. Pieces of brick and window frame which were found in the Glogova 1 grave that was opened later also established a link with Kravica. Here, the remains of 191 victims were found.<br \/>\n<strong>13\u201314 July: Ti\u0161\u0107a.\u00a0<\/strong>As the buses crowded with Bosnian women, children and elderly made their way from Poto\u010dari to Kladanj, they were stopped at Ti\u0161\u0107a village, searched, and the Bosnian men and boys found on board were removed from the bus. The evidence reveals a well-organised operation in Ti\u0161\u0107a.<br \/>\nFrom the checkpoint, an officer directed the soldier escorting the witness towards a nearby school where many other prisoners were being held. At the school, a soldier on a field telephone appeared to be transmitting and receiving orders. Sometime around midnight, the witness was loaded onto a truck with 22 other men with their hands tied behind their backs. At one point the truck stopped and a soldier on the scene said: &#8220;Not here. Take them up there, where they took people before.&#8221; The truck reached another stopping point where the soldiers came around to the back of the truck and started shooting the prisoners. The survivor escaped by running away from the truck and hiding in a forest.<br \/>\n<strong>14 July: Grbavci and Orahovac.\u00a0<\/strong>A large group of the prisoners who had been held overnight in Bratunac were bussed in a convoy of 30 vehicles to the Grbavci school in\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Orahovac\">Orahovac<\/a>\u00a0early in the morning of 14 July 1995. When they got there, the school gym was already half-filled with prisoners who had been arriving since the early morning hours and within a few hours, the building was completely full. Survivors estimated that there were 2,000 to 2,500 men there, some of them very young and some quite elderly, although the ICTY Prosecution suggested this may have been an over-estimation and that the number of prisoners at this site was probably closer to 1,000. Some prisoners were taken outside and killed. At some point, a witness recalled, General Mladi\u0107 arrived and told the men: &#8220;Well, your government does not want you and I have to take care of you.&#8221;<br \/>\nAfter being held in the gym for several hours, the men were led out in small groups to the execution fields that afternoon. Each prisoner was blindfolded and given a drink of water as he left the gym. The prisoners were then taken in trucks to the execution fields less than one kilometre away. The men were lined up and shot in the back; those who survived the initial shooting were killed with an extra shot. Two adjacent meadows were used; once one was full of bodies, the executioners moved to the other. While the executions were in progress, the survivors said, earth-moving equipment was digging the graves. A witness who survived the shootings by pretending to be dead, reported that General Mladi\u0107 drove up in a red car and watched some of the executions.<br \/>\nThe forensic evidence supports crucial aspects of the survivors&#8217; testimony. Both aerial photos show that the ground in Orahovac was disturbed between 5 and 27 July 1995 and again between 7 and 27 September 1995. Two primary mass graves were uncovered in the area and were named Lazete 1 and Lazete 2 by investigators.<br \/>\nThe Lazete 1 gravesite was exhumed by the ICTY Prosecution between 13 July and 3 August 2000. All of the 130 individuals uncovered, for whom sex could be determined, were male; 138 blindfolds were uncovered in the grave. Identification material for 23 persons, listed as missing following the fall of Srebrenica, was located during the exhumations at this site. The gravesite Lazete 2 was partly exhumed by a joint team from the Office of the Prosecutor and Physicians for Human Rights between August and September 1996 and completed in 2000. All of the 243 victims associated with Lazete 2 were male and the experts determined that the vast majority died of gunshot injuries. In addition, 147 blindfolds were located.<br \/>\nForensic analysis of soil\/pollen samples, blindfolds, ligatures, shell cases and aerial images of creation\/disturbance dates, further revealed that bodies from the Lazete 1 and 2 graves were removed and reburied at secondary graves named Hod\u017ei\u0107i Road 3, 4 and 5. Aerial images show that these secondary gravesites were created between 7 September and 2 October 1995 and all of them were exhumed in 1998.<br \/>\n<strong>14\u201315 July: Petkovi\u0107i.\u00a0<\/strong>On 14 and 15 July 1995, another large group of prisoners numbering some 1,500 to 2,000 were taken from Bratunac to the school in Petkovi\u0107i. The conditions under which these men were held at the Petkovi\u0107i school were even worse than those in Grbavci. It was hot, overcrowded and there was no food or water. In the absence of anything else, some prisoners chose to drink their own urine. Every now and then, soldiers would enter the room and physically abuse prisoners, or would call them outside. A few of the prisoners contemplated an escape attempt, but others said it would be better to stay since the International Red Cross would be sure to monitor the situation and they could not all be killed.<br \/>\nThe men were called outside in small groups. They were ordered to strip to the waist and to remove their shoes, whereupon their hands were tied behind their backs. During the night of 14 July, the men were taken by truck to the dam at Petkovi\u0107i. Those who arrived later could see immediately what was happening there. A large number of bodies were strewn on the ground, their hands tied behind their backs. Small groups of five to ten men were taken out of the trucks, lined up and shot. Some begged for water but their pleas were ignored. A survivor described his feelings of fear combined with thirst thus:<br \/>\nI was really sorry that I would die thirsty, and I was trying to hide amongst the people as long as I could, like everybody else. I just wanted to live for another second or two. And when it was my turn, I jumped out with what I believe were four other people. I could feel the gravel beneath my feet. It hurt&#8230;. I was walking with my head bent down and I wasn&#8217;t feeling anything&#8230;. And then I thought that I would die very fast, that I would not suffer. And I just thought that my mother would never know where I had ended up. This is what I was thinking as I was getting out of the truck. [As the soldiers walked around to kill the survivors of the first round of shooting] I was still very thirsty. But I was sort of between life and death. I didn&#8217;t know whether I wanted to live or to die anymore. I decided not to call out for them to shoot and kill me, but I was sort of praying to God that they&#8217;d come and kill me.<br \/>\nAfter the soldiers had left, two survivors helped each other to untie their hands, and then crawled over the heap of bodies towards the woods, where they intended to hide. As dawn arrived, they could see the execution site where bulldozers were collecting the bodies. On the way to the execution site, one of the survivors had peeked out from under his blindfold and had seen that Mladi\u0107 was also on his way to the scene.<br \/>\nAerial photos confirmed that the earth near the Petkovi\u0107i dam had been disturbed, and that it was disturbed yet again sometime between 7 and 27 September 1995. When the grave here was opened in April 1998, there seemed to be many bodies missing. Their removal had been accomplished with mechanical apparatus, causing considerable disturbance to the grave and its contents. At this time, the grave contained the remains of no more than 43 persons. Other bodies had been removed to a secondary grave, Liplje 2, prior to 2 October 1995. Here, the remains of at least 191 individuals were discovered.<br \/>\n<strong>14\u201316 July: Branjevo.\u00a0<\/strong>On 14 July 1995 more prisoners from Bratunac were bussed northward to a school in the village of Pilica, north of Zvornik. As at other detention facilities, there was no food or water and several men died in the school gym from heat and dehydration. The men were held at the Pilica school for two nights. On 16 July 1995, following a now familiar pattern, the men were called out of the school and loaded onto buses with their hands tied behind their backs. They were then driven to the Branjevo Military Farm, where groups of 10 were lined up and shot.<br \/>\nDra\u017een Erdemovi\u0107\u2014who confessed killing at least 70 Bosniaks\u2014was a member of the VRS 10th\u00a0Sabotage\u00a0Detachment (a Main Staff subordinate unit) and participated in mass executions. Erdemovi\u0107 appeared as a prosecution witness and testified: &#8220;The men in front of us were ordered to turn their backs. When those men turned their backs to us, we shot at them. We were given orders to shoot.&#8221;<br \/>\nOn this point, one of the survivors recalls:\u00a0When they shot, I threw myself on the ground&#8230; one man fell on my head. I think that he was killed on the spot. I could feel the hot blood pouring over me&#8230;. I could hear one man crying for help. He was begging them to kill him. And they simply said &#8220;Let him suffer. We&#8217;ll kill him later.&#8221;<br \/>\nErdemovi\u0107 said that all but one of the victims wore civilian clothes and that, except for one person who tried to escape, they offered no resistance before being shot. Sometimes the executioners were particularly cruel. When some of the soldiers recognised acquaintances from Srebrenica, they beat and humiliated them before killing them. Erdemovi\u0107 had to persuade his fellow soldiers to stop using a machine gun for the killings; while it mortally wounded the prisoners it did not cause death immediately and prolonged their suffering.\u00a0Between 1,000 and 1,200 men were killed in the course of that day at this execution site.<br \/>\nAerial photographs, taken on 17 July 1995 of an area around the Branjevo Military Farm, show a large number of bodies lying in the field near the farm, as well as traces of the excavator that collected the bodies from the field.Erdemovi\u0107 testified that, at around 15:00 hours on 16 July 1995 after he and his fellow soldiers from the 10th Sabotage Detachment had finished executing the prisoners at the Branjevo Military Farm, they were told that there was a group of 500 Bosnian prisoners from Srebrenica trying to break out of a nearby Dom Kultura club. Erdemovi\u0107 and the other members of his unit refused to carry out any more killings. They were then told to attend a meeting with a\u00a0Lieutenant Colonel\u00a0at a caf\u00e9 in Pilica. Erdemovi\u0107 and his fellow-soldiers travelled to the caf\u00e9 as requested and, as they waited, they could hear shots and grenades being detonated. The sounds lasted for approximately 15\u201320 minutes after which a soldier from Bratunac entered the caf\u00e9 to inform those present that &#8220;everything was over&#8221;.<br \/>\nThere were no survivors to explain exactly what had happened in the Dom Kultura. The executions at the Dom Kultura were remarkable in that this was no remote spot but a location in the centre of town on the main road from Zvornik to Bijeljina.\u00a0Over a year later, it was still possible to find physical evidence of this crime. As in Kravica, many traces of blood, hair and body tissue were found in the building, with cartridges and shells littered throughout the two storeys.\u00a0It could also be established that explosives and machine guns had been used. Human remains and personal possessions were found under the stage, where blood had dripped down through the floorboards.<br \/>\nTwo of the three survivors of the executions at the Branjevo Military Farm were arrested by local Bosnian Serb police on 25 July and sent to the\u00a0prisoner of war\u00a0compound at Batkovici. One had been a member of the group separated from the women in Poto\u010dari on 13 July. The prisoners who were taken to Batkovici survived the ordeal.\u00a0and were later able to testify before the Tribunal.<br \/>\n\u010can\u010dari Road 12 was the site of the re-interment of at least 174 bodies, moved here from the mass grave at the Branjevo Military Farm.\u00a0Only 43 were complete sets of remains, most of which established that death had taken place as the result of rifle fire. Of the 313 various body parts found, 145 displayed gunshot wounds of a severity likely to prove fatal.<br \/>\n<strong>14\u201317 July: Kozluk.\u00a0<\/strong>The exact date of the executions at Kozluk is not known, although it can be narrowed down to the period of 14 to 17 July 1995. The most probable dates are 15 and 16 July, not least due to the geographic location of Kozluk, between Petkovi\u0107i Dam and the Branjevo Military Farm. It therefore falls within the pattern of ever more northerly execution sites: Orahovac on 14 July, Petkovi\u0107i Dam on 15 July, the Branjevo Military Farm and the Pilica Dom Kultura on 16 July.\u00a0Another indication is that a Zvornik Brigade excavator spent eight hours in Kozluk on 16 July and a truck belonging to the same brigade made two journeys between Orahovac and Kozluk that day. A bulldozer is known to have been active in Kozluk on 18 and 19 July.<br \/>\nAmong Bosnian refugees in Germany, there were rumors of executions in Kozluk, during which the five hundred or so prisoners were forced to sing Serbian songs as they were being transported to the execution site. Although no survivors have since come forward, investigations in 1999 led to the discovery of a mass grave near Kozluk.\u00a0This proved to be the actual location of an execution as well, and lay alongside the Drina accessible only by driving through the barracks occupied by the\u00a0Drina Wolves, a regular police unit of Republika Srpska. The grave was not dug specifically for the purpose: it had previously been a quarry and a landfill site. Investigators found many shards of green glass which the nearby &#8216;Vitinka&#8217; bottling plant had dumped there. This facilitated the process of establishing links with the secondary graves along \u010can\u010dari Road.\u00a0The grave at Kozluk had been partly cleared some time prior to 27 September 1995 but no fewer than 340 bodies were found there nonetheless.\u00a0In 237 cases, it was clear that they had died as the result of rifle fire: 83 by a single shot to the head, 76 by one shot through the torso region, 72 by multiple bullet wounds, five by wounds to the legs and one person by bullet wounds to the arm. The ages of the victims were between 8 and 85 years old. Some had been physically disabled, occasionally as the result of amputation. Many had clearly been tied and bound using strips of clothing or nylon thread.<br \/>\nAlong the \u010can\u010dari Road are twelve known mass graves, of which only two\u2014\u010can\u010dari Road 3 and 12\u2014have been investigated in detail (as of 2000).\u00a0\u010can\u010dari Road 3 is known to have been a secondary grave linked to Kozluk, as shown by the glass fragments and labels from the Vitinka factory.\u00a0The remains of 158 victims were found here, of which 35 bodies were still more or less intact and indicated that most had been killed by gunfire.<br \/>\n<strong>13\u201318 July: Bratunac-Konjevi\u0107 Polje road.\u00a0<\/strong>On 13 July, near Konjevi\u0107 Polje, Serb soldiers summarily executed hundreds of Bosniaks, including women and children.<br \/>\nThe men who were found attempting to escape by the Bratunac-Konjevi\u0107 Polje road were told that the Geneva Convention would be observed if they gave themselves up. In Bratunac, men were told that there were Serbian personnel standing by to escort them to\u00a0Zagreb\u00a0for an exchange of prisoners. The visible presence of UN uniforms and UN vehicles, stolen from Dutchbat, were intended to contribute to the feeling of reassurance. On 17 to 18 July, Serb soldiers captured about 150\u2013200 Bosnians in the vicinity of Konjevic Polje and summarily executed about one half of them.<br \/>\n<strong>18\u201319 July: Nezuk-Baljkovica frontline.\u00a0<\/strong>After the closure of the corridor at Baljkovica, several groups of stragglers nevertheless attempted to escape into Bosnian territory. Most were captured by VRS troops in the Nezuk\u2014Baljkovica area and killed on the spot. In the vicinity of Nezuk, about 20 small groups surrendered to Bosnian Serb military forces. After the men surrendered, Bosnian Serb soldiers ordered them to line up and summarily executed them.<br \/>\nOn 19 July, for example, a group of approximately 11 men was killed at Nezuk itself by units of the 16th\u00a0Krajina\u00a0Brigade, then operating under the direct command of the Zvornik Brigade. Reports reveal that a further 13 men, all ARBiH soldiers, were killed at Nezuk on 19 July.\u00a0The report of the march to Tuzla includes the account of an ARBiH soldier who witnessed several executions carried out by police that day. He survived because 30 ARBiH soldiers were needed for an exchange of prisoners following the ARBiH&#8217;s capture of a VRS officer at Baljkovica. The soldier was himself exchanged late 1995; at that time, there were still 229 men from Srebrenica in the Batkovici\u00a0prisoner of war camp, including two men who had been taken prisoner in 1994.<br \/>\nAt the same time, RS Ministry of the Interior forces conducting a search of the terrain from Kamenica as far as Snagovo killed eight Bosniaks.\u00a0Around 200 Muslims armed with\u00a0automatic\u00a0and\u00a0hunting rifles\u00a0were reported to be hiding near the old road near Snagovo.\u00a0During the morning, about 50 Bosniaks attacked the Zvornik Brigade line in the area of Pandurica, attempting to break through to Bosnian government territory.\u00a0The Zvornik Public Security Centre planned to surround and destroy these two groups the following day using all available forces.<br \/>\n<strong>20\u201322 July: Meces area.\u00a0<\/strong>According to ICTY indictments of Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107 and Ratko Mladi\u0107, on 20 to 21 July 1995 near the village of Meces, VRS personnel, using megaphones, urged Bosniak men who had fled Srebrenica to surrender and assured them that they would be safe. Approximately 350 men responded to these entreaties and surrendered. The soldiers then took approximately 150 of them, instructed them to dig their own graves and summarily executed them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>AFTER THE MASSACRE<br \/>\n<\/strong>ICMP&#8217;s\u00a0Podrinje Identification Project\u00a0(PIP) was formed to deal with the identification primarily of victims of 1995 Srebrenica massacre. PIP includes a facility for storing, processing, and handling exhumed remains. Much of the remains are only fragments or commingled body fragments since they were recovered from secondary\u00a0mass graves. The photo depicts one section of the refrigerated\u00a0mortuary.<br \/>\nDuring the days following the massacre, American\u00a0spy planes\u00a0overflew the area of Srebrenica, and took photos showing the ground in vast areas around the town had been removed, a sign of mass burials.<br \/>\nOn 22 July, the commanding officer of the\u00a0Zvornik Brigade, Lieutenant Colonel\u00a0Vinko Pandurevi\u0107, requested the Drina Corps to set up a committee to oversee the exchange of prisoners. He also asked for instructions where the prisoners of war his unit had already captured should be taken and to whom they should be handed over. Approximately 50 wounded captives were taken to the Bratunac hospital. Another group of prisoners was taken to the Batkovi\u0107i camp (near Bijeljina), and these were mostly exchanged later.\u00a0On 25 July, the Zvornik Brigade captured 25 more ARBiH soldiers who were taken directly to the camp at Batkovi\u0107i, as were 34 ARBiH men captured the following day.<br \/>\nZvornik Brigade reports up until 31 July continue to describe the search for refugees and the capture of small groups of Bosniaks.<br \/>\nA number of Bosniaks managed to cross over the River Drina into Serbia at\u00a0Ljubovija\u00a0and Bajina Ba\u0161ta. 38 of them were returned to RS. Some were taken to the Batkovi\u0107i camp, where they were exchanged. The fate of the majority has not been established.\u00a0Some of those attempting to cross the Drina drowned.<br \/>\nBy 17 July 201 Bosniak soldiers had arrived in \u017depa, exhausted and many with light wounds.\u00a0By 28 July another 500 had arrived in \u017depa from Srebrenica.<br \/>\nAfter 19 July 1995, small Bosniak groups were hiding in the woods for days and months, trying to reach Tuzla. Numerous refugees found themselves cut off for some time in the area around Mount Udrc. They did not know what to do next or where to go; they managed to stay alive by eating snails, leaves and mushrooms. The atmosphere was one of tension, hunger and desperation. On or about 23 July, the Bosnian Serbs swept through this area too, and according to one survivor they killed many people as they did so.<br \/>\nMeanwhile, the VRS had commenced the process of clearing the bodies from around Srebrenica, \u017depa, Kamenica and Snagovo. Work parties and municipal services were deployed to help. In Srebrenica, the refuse that had littered the streets since the departure of the people was collected and burnt, the town disinfected and deloused.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Wanderers.\u00a0<\/strong>Many people in the part of the column which had not succeeded in passing Kamenica did not wish to give themselves up and decided to turn back towards \u017depa. Others remained where they were, splitting up into smaller groups of no more than ten. Some wandered around for months, either alone or groups of two, four or six men. Few knew the way and so attempted to navigate by following overhead power cables. They often found corpses, by now in a state of decomposition. Sometimes one group met another group from Srebrenica who knew of a deserted Bosniak village in the region; they would then proceed there together.<br \/>\nSome of the Bosniak men decided to retrace their steps towards the Srebrenica region, since this was familiar territory and they knew where to find food. From here, they would once again set out towards \u017depa or attempt to reach Tuzla. Some arrived in Tuzla after many months, having been wandering around the area between Srebrenica and Udrc with absolutely no sense of direction. A few hundred managed to reach \u017depa just before the Serb military, paramilitary and police forces occupied the enclave on 25 July 1995. Once \u017depa had succumbed to the Serb pressure, they had to move on once more, either trying to reach Tuzla or crossing the River Drina into Serbia.<br \/>\nTo feed themselves, the men took potatoes and other vegetables from the fields around the Serbian villages at night. The local Serb population therefore began to mount patrols around their villages. The Bosniaks would generally sleep by day and wait for the cover of darkness before moving on. This continued for a long time. For example, the people of Milici, a village on the route to Tuzla, discovered the disappearance of livestock in November 1995 and formed an armed group in search of stragglers from the column.<br \/>\nThere are many stories recalling the experiences of those who lost contact with the column, their wanderings and the horrors they saw. One involves three young men aged 17, 18 and 19, who on several occasions attempted to cross the main Konjevi\u0107 Polje to Nova Kasaba road but were unsuccessful in doing so each time. They eventually managed to reach \u017depa only after the enclave had fallen as well. The group had set up camp in a couple of deserted Bosniak villages where they managed to hide out for several months without attracting attention. Sometimes the teenagers would escort groups of other refugees as far as the next obstacle, before eventually returning to their base. Finally, on 26 April 1996, a full six months after the signing of the\u00a0Dayton Accord, they crossed the Drina into Serbia.<br \/>\n<strong>Zvornik 7.\u00a0<\/strong>The most famous group of seven men wandered about in occupied territory for the entire winter. On 10 May 1996, after nine months on the run and over six months after the end of the war, they were discovered in a quarry by American\u00a0IFOR\u00a0soldiers. They immediately turned over to the patrol; they were searched and their weapons (two\u00a0pistols\u00a0and three hand grenades) were confiscated. The men said that they had been in hiding in the immediate vicinity of Srebrenica since the fall of the enclave. They did not look like soldiers and the Americans decided that this was a matter for the police.\u00a0The operations officer of this American unit ordered that a Serb patrol should be escorted into the quarry whereupon the men would be handed over to the Serbs.<br \/>\nThe prisoners said they were initially tortured after the transfer, but later were treated relatively well. In April 1997 the local court in\u00a0Republika Srpska\u00a0convicted the group, known as the\u00a0Zvornik 7, for illegal possession of firearms and three of them for the murder of four Serbian woodsmen. When announcing the verdict the presenter of the TV of Republika Srpska described them as\u00a0the group of Muslim terrorists from Srebrenica who last year massacred Serb civilians.\u00a0The trial was widely condemned by the international community as &#8220;a flagrant miscarriage of justice&#8221;,\u00a0and the conviction was later quashed for &#8216;procedural reasons&#8217; following pressure from the international community. In 1999, the three remaining defendants in the Zvornik 7 case were swapped for three Serbs serving 15 years each in a Bosnian prison.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reburials in the secondary mass graves.\u00a0<\/strong>From approximately 1 August 1995 to 1 November 1995, there was an organised effort to remove the bodies from primary mass gravesites and transport them to secondary and tertiary gravesites.\u00a0In the ICTY court case &#8220;Prosecutor v. Blagojevi\u0107 and Joki\u0107&#8221;, the trial chamber found that this reburial effort was an attempt to conceal evidence of the mass murders.\u00a0The trial chamber found that the cover up operation was ordered by the\u00a0VRS Main Staff\u00a0and subsequently carried out by members of the\u00a0Bratunac\u00a0and Zvornik Brigades.<br \/>\nThe cover-up operation has had a direct impact on the recovery and identification of the remains. The removal and reburial of the bodies have caused them to become dismembered and co-mingled, making it difficult for forensic investigators to positively identify the remains.\u00a0For example, in one specific case, the remains of one person were found in two different locations, 30\u00a0km apart.\u00a0In addition to the ligatures and blindfolds found at the mass graves, the effort to hide the bodies has been seen as evidence of the organised nature of the massacres and the non-combatant status of the victims, since had the victims died in normal combat operations, there would be no need to hide their remains.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Greek Volunteers controversy.\u00a0<\/strong>According to\u00a0Agence France Presse\u00a0(AFP), a dozen Greek volunteers fought alongside the Serbs at Srebrenica. They were members of the Greek Volunteer Guard (\u0395\u0395\u03a6), or GVG, a contingent of Greek paramilitaries formed at the request of Ratko Mladi\u0107 as an integral part of the Drina Corps. The Greek volunteers were motivated by the desire to support their &#8220;Orthodox\u00a0brothers&#8221; in battle.\u00a0They raised the Greek flag at Srebrenica after the fall of the town at Mladi\u0107&#8217;s request, to honour &#8220;the brave Greeks fighting on our side.&#8221;\u00a0Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107 subsequently decorated four of them.<br \/>\nIn 2005, Greek deputy\u00a0Andreas Andrianopoulos\u00a0called for an investigation into the role of Greek volunteers in Srebrenica.\u00a0The Greek Minister of Justice\u00a0Anastasios Papaligouras\u00a0commissioned an inquiry, which had still not reported as of July\u00a02010.<br \/>\nIn 2009,\u00a0Stavros Vitalis\u00a0announced that the volunteers were suing the writer\u00a0Takis Michas\u00a0for libel over allegations in his book\u00a0Unholy Alliance, in which Michas described aspects of the Greek state&#8217;s tacit support for the Serbs during the Bosnian War. Insisting that the volunteers had simply taken part in what he described as the &#8220;re-occupation&#8221; of the town, Vitalis acknowledged that he himself was present with senior Serb officers in &#8220;all operations&#8221; for Srebrenica&#8217;s re-occupation by the Serbs.\u00a0Michas said that the volunteers were treated like heroes and at no point did Greek justice contact them to investigate their knowledge of potential crimes to assist the work of the ICTY at The Hague.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>BACKGROUND Conflict in eastern Bosnia The multiethnic\u00a0Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina\u00a0was mainly inhabited by Muslim\u00a0Bosniaks\u00a0(44 percent),\u00a0Orthodox\u00a0Serbs\u00a0(31 percent) and Catholic\u00a0Croats\u00a0(17 percent).
