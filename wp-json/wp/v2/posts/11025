It borders\u00a0Bosnia and Herzegovina\u00a0to the north;\u00a0Serbia\u00a0and\u00a0Kosovo\u00a0to the east,\u00a0Albania\u00a0to the south and\u00a0Croatia\u00a0to the west. Montenegro has an area of 13,812 square kilometres and a population of 620,079 (2011 census). Its capital is \u00a0Podgorica\u00a0and\u00a0Cetinje\u00a0is designated as the Old Royal Capital.<br \/>\nDuring the\u00a0Early Medieval\u00a0period, three principalities were located on the territory of modern-day Montenegro:\u00a0Duklja, roughly corresponding to the southern half;\u00a0Travunia, the west; and\u00a0Rascia\u00a0proper, the north. In 1042,\u00a0archon\u00a0Stefan Vojislav\u00a0led a revolt that resulted in the independence of Duklja from the\u00a0Byzantine Empire\u00a0and the establishment of the\u00a0Vojislavljevi\u0107 dynasty. The independent\u00a0Principality of Zeta\u00a0emerged in the 14th and 15th centuries, ruled by the\u00a0House of Bal\u0161i\u0107\u00a0between 1356 and 1421, and by the\u00a0House of Crnojevi\u0107\u00a0between 1431 and 1498, when the name Montenegro started being used for the country. After falling under\u00a0Ottoman rule, Montenegro regained\u00a0de facto\u00a0independence in 1697 under the rule of the\u00a0House of Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161, first under the theocratic rule of\u00a0prince-bishops, before being transformed into a secular\u00a0principality\u00a0in 1852. Montenegro&#8217;s\u00a0de jure independence was recognised by the\u00a0Great Powers\u00a0at the\u00a0Congress of Berlin\u00a0in 1878, following the\u00a0Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War. In 1905, the country became a\u00a0kingdom. After\u00a0World War I, it became part of\u00a0Yugoslavia. Following the\u00a0breakup of Yugoslavia, the republics of\u00a0Serbia\u00a0and\u00a0Montenegro\u00a0together established a\u00a0federation\u00a0known as the\u00a0Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which was renamed\u00a0State Union of Serbia and Montenegro\u00a0in 2003. On the basis of an\u00a0independence referendum\u00a0held in May 2006, Montenegro declared independence and the federation peacefully dissolved on 3 June of that year.<br \/>\nSince 1990, the\u00a0sovereign state\u00a0of Montenegro has been governed by the\u00a0Democratic Party of Socialists\u00a0and its minor coalition partners. Classified by the\u00a0World Bank\u00a0as an upper middle-income country, Montenegro is a member of the\u00a0UN,\u00a0NATO, the\u00a0World Trade Organization, the\u00a0Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the\u00a0Council of Europe, and the\u00a0Central European Free Trade Agreement. It is a founding member of the\u00a0Union for the Mediterranean.<\/p>\n<p>The country&#8217;s name derives from\u00a0Venetian\u00a0and translates as &#8220;Black Mountain&#8221;, deriving from the appearance of\u00a0Mount Lov\u0107en\u00a0when covered in dense evergreen forests.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GEOGRAPHY<\/strong><br \/>\nMontenegro ranges from high peaks along its borders with Serbia, Kosovo, and Albania, a segment of the\u00a0Karst\u00a0of the western Balkan Peninsula, to a narrow coastal plain that is only 1.5 to 6kms wide. The plain stops abruptly in the north, where\u00a0Mount Lov\u0107en\u00a0and\u00a0Mount Orjen\u00a0plunge into the inlet of the Bay of Kotor.<br \/>\nMontenegro&#8217;s large karst region lies generally at elevations of 1,000m above sea level; some parts, however, rise to 2,000\u00a0m (6,560\u00a0ft), such as\u00a0Mount Orjen\u00a0(1,894\u00a0m or 6,214\u00a0ft), the highest massif among the coastal limestone ranges. The\u00a0Zeta River\u00a0valley, at an elevation of 500\u00a0m (1,600\u00a0ft), is the lowest segment.<br \/>\nThe mountains of Montenegro include some of the most rugged terrain in Europe, averaging more than 2,000 metres (6,600 feet) in elevation. One of the country&#8217;s notable peaks is\u00a0Bobotov Kuk\u00a0in the\u00a0Durmitor\u00a0mountains, which reaches a height of 2,522\u00a0m (8,274\u00a0ft). Owing to the hyperhumid climate on their western sides, the Montenegrin mountain ranges were among the most ice-eroded parts of the Balkan Peninsula during the last glacial period.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ECONOMY<\/strong><br \/>\nThe economy of Montenegro is mostly\u00a0service-based\u00a0and is in\u00a0late transition\u00a0to a\u00a0market economy. According to the\u00a0International Monetary Fund, the\u00a0nominal GDP\u00a0of Montenegro was $4.376 billion in 2016.\u00a0The\u00a0GDP PPP\u00a0for 2016 was $10.428 billion, or $16,749 per capita. According to\u00a0Eurostat\u00a0data, the Montenegrin GDP per capita stood at 46% of the EU average in 2017.\u00a0The\u00a0Central Bank of Montenegro\u00a0is not part of the euro system but the country is &#8220;euroised&#8221;, using\u00a0the euro unilaterally\u00a0as its currency.<br \/>\nGDP grew at 10.7% in 2007 and 7.5% in 2008.\u00a0The country entered a\u00a0recession\u00a0in 2008 as a part of the\u00a0global recession, with GDP contracting by 4%. However, Montenegro remained a target for\u00a0foreign investment, the only country in the Balkans to increase its amount of direct foreign investment.\u00a0The country exited the recession in mid-2010, with GDP growth at around 0.5%.\u00a0However, the significant dependence of the Montenegrin economy on\u00a0foreign direct investment\u00a0leaves it susceptible to external shocks and a high export\/import trade deficit.<br \/>\nIn 2007, the\u00a0service sector\u00a0made up 72.4% of GDP, with industry and agriculture making up the rest at 17.6% and 10%, respectively. There are 50,000 farming households in Montenegro that rely on agriculture to fill the family budget.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TOURISM <\/strong><br \/>\nMontenegro has both a picturesque coast and a mountainous northern region. The country was a well-known tourist spot in the 1980s. Yet, the\u00a0Yugoslav wars\u00a0that were fought in neighbouring countries during the 1990s crippled the tourist industry and damaged the image of Montenegro for years.<br \/>\nWith a total of 1.6\u00a0million visitors, the nation is the 36th (out of 47 countries) most visited country in Europe.<br \/>\nThe Montenegrin\u00a0Adriatic\u00a0coast is 295\u00a0km (183\u00a0mi) long, with 72\u00a0km (45\u00a0mi) of beaches, and with many well-preserved ancient old towns.\u00a0National Geographic Traveler features Montenegro among the &#8220;50 Places of a Lifetime&#8221;, and Montenegrin seaside\u00a0Sveti Stefan was used as the cover for the magazine.\u00a0The coast region of Montenegro is considered one of the great new &#8220;discoveries&#8221; among world tourists. In January 2010,\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0ranked the Ulcinj South Coast region of Montenegro, including\u00a0Velika Plaza,\u00a0Ada Bojana, and the\u00a0Hotel Mediteran\u00a0of Ulcinj, as among the &#8220;Top 31 Places to Go in 2010&#8221; as part of a worldwide ranking of tourism destinations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DEMOGRAPHICS<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Ethnic structure.<\/strong> Montenegro is\u00a0multiethnic state\u00a0in which no ethnic group forms a majority.\u00a0Major ethnic groups include\u00a0Montenegrins\u00a0and\u00a0Serbs, others are\u00a0Bosniaks,\u00a0Albanians and\u00a0Croats. The number of &#8220;Montenegrins&#8221; and &#8220;Serbs&#8221; fluctuates widely from census to census due to changes in how people perceive, experience, or choose to express, their identity and ethnic affiliation.<br \/>\n<strong>Languages.\u00a0<\/strong>The official language in Montenegro is\u00a0Montenegrin. Also,\u00a0Serbian,\u00a0Bosnian,\u00a0Albanian\u00a0and\u00a0Croatian\u00a0are recognized in usage. Montenegrin, Serbian, Bosnian, and Croatian are\u00a0mutually intelligible, all being\u00a0standard varieties\u00a0of\u00a0Serbo-Croatian language. Montenegrin is the plurality mother tongue of the population under 18 years of age and the majority of the population claims Montenegrin as their mother tongue.\u00a0Previous constitutions endorsed Serbo-Croatian as the official language in\u00a0SR Montenegro\u00a0and Serbian of\u00a0Ijekavian standard during the\u00a01992\u20132006 period.<br \/>\n<strong>Religion<\/strong><br \/>\nOrthodox\u00a0Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Podgorica2.\u00a0Roman Catholic cathedral in Kotor3.

Montenegrins have been, historically, members of the\u00a0Serbian Orthodox Church\u00a0and\u00a0Serbian Orthodox Christianity\u00a0is the most popular religion today in Montenegro. The\u00a0Montenegrin Orthodox Church\u00a0was recently founded and is followed by a small minority of Montenegrins although it is not in communion with any other Christian Orthodox Church as it has not been officially recognized.<br \/>\nDespite tensions between religious groups during the\u00a0Bosnian War, Montenegro remained fairly stable, mainly due its population having a historic perspective on religious tolerance and faith diversity.\u00a0Religious institutions from Montenegro all have guaranteed rights and are separate from the state.<br \/>\nThe second largest religion is Islam, which amounts to 19% of the total population of the country. One third of\u00a0Albanians\u00a0are\u00a0Catholics\u00a0(8,126 in the 2004 census) while the two other thirds (22,267) are mainly\u00a0Sunni Muslims; in 2012 a protocol passed that recognizes\u00a0Islam\u00a0as an official religion in Montenegro, ensures that\u00a0halal\u00a0foods will be served at military facilities, hospitals, dormitories and all social facilities; and that Muslim women will be permitted to wear headscarves in schools and at public institutions, as well as ensuring that Muslims have the right to take Fridays off work for the\u00a0Jumu&#8217;ah\u00a0(Friday)-prayer.\u00a0There is also a small Roman Catholic population, mostly Albanians with some Croats, divided between the\u00a0Archdiocese of Antivari\u00a0headed by the Primate of Serbia and the\u00a0Diocese of Kotor\u00a0that is a part of the\u00a0Church of Croatia.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Montenegro\u00a0(Montenegrin)\u00a0is a country in\u00a0Southeastern Europe\u00a0on the\u00a0Adriatic Sea.
