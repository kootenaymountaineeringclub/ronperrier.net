The daily grind confronts us with dirt, germs, and sweat, and a soapy shower provides the simple, pleasurable antidote.<\/p>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-0 text-left\">Uncontroversial though soap may seem, some people are very troubled by your sudsy lather: dermatologists. \u201cIf you talk to most dermatologists, probably none of them use actual soap, except on their hands,\u201d says Dr. Erin Chen, herself a dermatologist at Massachusetts General Hospital.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mb-8\">\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-6 text-left\">Here\u2019s what Chen and four other experts say about avoiding soap, healthier substitutes, and tips to make sure your cleaning rituals aren\u2019t accidentally undermining your skin health.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"text-mobile-h3 lg:text-h3 font-editorial mb-2 text-black-coffee text-left\">The many downsides of soap<\/h2>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-6 text-left\">Soap rubs skin the wrong way for\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0196655306009503\">several reasons<\/a>. It \u201ccontains many ingredients that just don\u2019t do well for the skin,\u201d says Dr. Anthony Rossi, a dermatologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.<\/p>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-6 text-left\">Soap combines fats or oils with sodium hydroxide (in the case of soap bars) or potassium hydroxide (for liquid soap). These ingredients are very effective at breaking down dirt\u2014<em>too<\/em>\u00a0effective, in that they cause irritation and damage to the lipids that keep the skin strong and hydrated, Rossi says.<\/p>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-0 text-left\">A study in healthy volunteers\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/18199943\/\">showed<\/a>\u00a0that washing with soap disrupts the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/7212990\/what-is-broken-skin-barrier-dermatologists\/\">skin barrier<\/a>, and the more times soap was applied and rinsed while cleaning, the more disruption occurred. Such affronts lead to dry skin, sensitivity, and increased risk of infection, says the study\u2019s author, David Voegeli, an immuno-pharmacologist and nursing professor at the University of Winchester in England.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"\">\n<div class=\"p-0 mb-0\">\n<div class=\"native-ad flex w-full flex-col items-center justify-center\">\n<div id=\"native-ad-inline-1\" class=\"flex min-h-px w-full min-w-px max-w-[100vw] items-center justify-center overflow-hidden bg-transparent text-center group-[.disable-ads]:hidden print:hidden  flex mb-0\" role=\"region\" aria-labelledby=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" data-native=\"false\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The study also showed that soap changed the skin\u2019s acidity. This happens because soap has a lower acidity level than the skin, and the mismatch upsets the skin\u2019s pH balance. Soap may be especially problematic if it\u2019s not rinsed off thoroughly, which is more likely with bar soap than the liquid variety. \u201cThe residue just stays there and disrupts the pH balance for longer,\u201d Voegeli says.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mb-8\">\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-6 text-left\"><strong>Read More<\/strong>:\u00a0<em><a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/7260509\/weird-dermatology-symptoms-skin-cancer\/\">12 Weird Symptoms Dermatologists Say You Should Never Ignore<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-6 text-left\">Changing the pH level has a domino effect because \u201cpH is also really important for the skin\u2019s microbial defense,\u201d Rossi says. A related problem is that soap\u2019s chemicals clear out the bacteria from our skin. Nice as that may sound, many such bacteria are actually key to protecting skin health.<\/p>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-0 text-left\">Many soaps contain yet more chemicals that have nothing to do with cleaning and everything to do with creating a fragrant facade<em>\u00a0<\/em>of<em>\u00a0<\/em>cleanliness. These fragrance chemicals, while psychologically pleasing, can lead to irritation and allergies. \u201cYou would never tolerate perfume or scent in your eye drops,\u201d says Dr. Rachel Nazarian, a dermatologist at Mt. Sinai Hospital. \u201cWhy do we disrespect the skin by putting all of this flowery, fluffy garbage in soap?\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"\">\n<div class=\"p-0 mb-0\">\n<div id=\"inline-ad-1\" class=\"flex min-h-px w-full min-w-px max-w-[100vw] items-center justify-center  bg-transparent text-center group-[.disable-ads]:hidden print:hidden  flex mb-0\" role=\"region\" aria-labelledby=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" data-native=\"false\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mb-8\">\n<h2 class=\"text-mobile-h3 lg:text-h3 font-editorial mb-2 text-black-coffee text-left\">Use this instead<\/h2>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-6 text-left\">Instead of daily soap-downs, dermatologists prefer skin cleansers. Compared to soap\u2019s harshness, many cleansers have milder ingredients that achieve sufficient cleaning without overdoing it.<\/p>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-6 text-left\">\u201cCleansers have a pH that matches the skin, and they don\u2019t strip the whole barrier off the way old-school soap does,\u201d Nazarian says. In a 2021\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/35357722\/\">study<\/a>, German researchers found that the frequent use of skin-friendly cleansers during handwashing caused no impairments to the skin barrier.<\/p>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-0 text-left\">Even with cleansers, it\u2019s important to choose the right ones and avoid overuse, Nazarian adds. Some of them have better pH levels than others, she says; people should look for the cleansers with \u201cpH balanced\u201d written on the label. The company Cetaphil, for example, makes several cleansers\u2014each of which is better than soap, every dermatologist we spoke to said\u2014but you want to opt for\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/14728695\/\">versions with less foam<\/a>, Nazarian says. Foamy cleansers can be abrasive (while still preferable to soap). Ingredients to watch out for that cause foam are sodium lauryl sulfate and cocamidopropyl betaine, Rossi says. Test new cleansers on your forearm to ensure the ingredients won\u2019t cause a reaction.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mb-8\">\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-6 text-left\">Beside foaming ingredients, some cleansers have other red-flag ingredients that could cause allergic reactions, Rossi says. Examples are fragrance mix I and II. Be cautious, too, with formaldehyde-releasing preservatives like benzylhemiformal. Dr. Shilpi Khetarpal, a Cleveland Clinic dermatologist, suggests looking for cleansers certified by the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/nationaleczema.org\/eczema-products\/\">National Eczema Association<\/a>. \u201cThey\u2019re safe for everyone to use,\u201d Khetarpal says, while noting that \u201ctoo much of anything can be detrimental.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-6 text-left\">Other gentle cleansers are made by CeraVe and Aveeno, she says.<\/p>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-0 text-left\">As for body washes: most are cleansers, but some are soaps. The terms soap and cleanser are sometimes used interchangeably\u2014but not by dermatologists. Effective cleansers may come in bar form, such as Dove Sensitive Skin, but \u201cthis is not soap,\u201d Nazarian says. Khetarpal prefers the bar form of cleanser instead of body wash.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"\">\n<div class=\"p-0 mb-0\">\n<div id=\"inline-ad-3\" class=\"flex min-h-px w-full min-w-px max-w-[100vw] items-center justify-center  bg-transparent text-center group-[.disable-ads]:hidden print:hidden  flex mb-0\" role=\"region\" aria-labelledby=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" data-native=\"false\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">But even cleansers should be used sparingly, some dermatologists think. When using a cleanser, you\u2019re probably doing enough to counter dirt by just specifically targeting the smellier areas\u2014armpits, groin, and feet. Nazarian uses an unscented cleanser in these areas only during her daily showers (in addition to shampoo). \u201cYou don\u2019t need to cleanse the whole body,\u201d Nazarian says. She thinks that shampoo suds running down the body clean effectively without requiring much else. \u201cSuds do a nice, basic cleaning of bacterial sweat.\u201d<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mb-8\">\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-6 text-left\">Meanwhile, Khetarpil uses her non-soap cleanser over the entire body.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"text-mobile-h3 lg:text-h3 font-editorial mb-2 text-black-coffee text-left\">The hand exception<\/h2>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-0 text-left\">Dermatologists like Nazarian make an exception for soap when it comes to handwashing, as opposed to showering. After constant contact with other people, subway poles, bathrooms, and other dirty surfaces, \u201cmore intense germ removal is sometimes needed,\u201d in which case it\u2019s recommended to reach for soap when washing hands, Nazarian says.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"\">\n<div class=\"p-0 mb-0\">\n<div id=\"inline-ad-4\" class=\"flex min-h-px w-full min-w-px max-w-[100vw] items-center justify-center  bg-transparent text-center group-[.disable-ads]:hidden print:hidden  flex mb-0\" role=\"region\" aria-labelledby=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" data-native=\"false\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The hands can handle soap\u2019s strength better because the skin there is \u201cmuch thicker, so it\u2019s less prone to drying out from washing,\u201d than most other parts of the body, Chen explains.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mb-8\">\n<h2 class=\"text-mobile-h3 lg:text-h3 font-editorial mb-2 text-black-coffee text-left\">\nSometimes water suffices<\/h2>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-6 text-left\">Deploy cleansers in the shower when you\u2019re noticeably dirty, but not daily, Chen says; water is enough for cleaning most of the time. Rossi agrees: \u201cThe natural lathering of water is going to get rid of most of the bacteria on your skin.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-6 text-left\">This approach dovetails with the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/articles\/PMC4918254\/\">hygiene hypothesis<\/a>: some scientists believe that, in recent decades, an overage of skin cleaning has reduced people\u2019s beneficial bacteria too much, leading to upticks in allergies and infections. \u201cWe\u2019re too clean,\u201d Rossi says, so the immune system is less capable of fighting parasites.<\/p>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-0 text-left\">Dermatologists like Rossi think people can skip showers altogether, multiple days per week. This view isn\u2019t unanimous, though. Khetarpal advises that most people \u201ccan and should shower every day,\u201d particularly if using mild cleanser instead of soap. Only those with sensitive or eczema-prone skin should think about skipping shower days, she says.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"\">\n<div class=\"p-0 mb-0\">\n<div id=\"inline-ad-5\" class=\"flex min-h-px w-full min-w-px max-w-[100vw] items-center justify-center  bg-transparent text-center group-[.disable-ads]:hidden print:hidden  flex mb-0\" role=\"region\" aria-labelledby=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" data-native=\"false\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mb-8\">\n<h2 class=\"text-mobile-h3 lg:text-h3 font-editorial mb-2 text-black-coffee text-left\">Don\u2019t get yourself in hot water<\/h2>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-6 text-left\">Perhaps the ultimate one-two punch against the skin\u2019s defenses is soap and hot water. Even when using a gentle cleanser or just water, the skin suffers with excess heat. Thirty-minute steamy hot showers \u201ccan\u2019t be a daily thing,\u201d Nazarian says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to destroy your skin that way.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-6 text-left\">Hot water strips away the body\u2019s natural oils, causes water loss within the skin, and damages the skin\u2019s outer layer so it retains less moisture,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/articles\/PMC8778033\/\">research shows<\/a>. Inflammation and flakiness may result.<\/p>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-6 text-left\">Navarian compromises with patients by conceding hot showers as an occasional treat. \u201cSave them for when you\u2019re having a really bad day.\u201d Another acceptable approach is enjoying hot water only for the final 1-2 minutes of your shower, she adds. The rest of the time it should be lukewarm, around 98-100\u00b0F.<\/p>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-0 text-left\">Whether you\u2019re using soap or cleanser, never combine them with a loofah or other physical exfoliant. \u201cThe only parts of your body that can probably handle a physical exfoliant are the heels of your feet,\u201d Nazarian says. She advises using a very gentle wash cloth instead.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"\">\n<div class=\"p-0 mb-0\">\n<div id=\"inline-ad-6\" class=\"flex min-h-px w-full min-w-px max-w-[100vw] items-center justify-center  bg-transparent text-center group-[.disable-ads]:hidden print:hidden  flex mb-0\" role=\"region\" aria-labelledby=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" data-native=\"false\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Post-shower, don\u2019t get carried away with vigorous toweling. \u201cThe rougher your towel, the more skin you\u2019re going to strip off,\u201d Voegeli says. Instead, dab yourself dry.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mb-8\">\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-6 text-left\">Application of a good moisturizer after showering can help, Nazarian adds. \u201cIf people use moisturizer immediately after getting out, they can buy themselves a little more flexibility with how they cleanse, with less skin punishment.\u201d Chen emphasizes the use of a post-shower emollient moisturizer like Vaseline to help repair skin barrier function and improve appearance, noting it\u2019s especially important if you\u2019re showering daily. \u201cMost people need a little assistance to replace their skin\u2019s lipids after showering,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"text-mobile-h3 lg:text-h3 font-editorial mb-2 text-black-coffee text-left\">Take particular care if\u2026<\/h2>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-0 text-left\">Older people may be more\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/journals\/physiology\/articles\/10.3389\/fphys.2023.1195272\/full\">vulnerable<\/a>\u00a0to the effects of overcleaning, Nazarian points out. This is particularly true of menopausal women, for whom hormonal changes typically create a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/articles\/PMC10092853\/\">drying effect<\/a>\u00a0on the skin.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"\">\n<div class=\"p-0 mb-0\">\n<div id=\"inline-ad-7\" class=\"flex min-h-px w-full min-w-px max-w-[100vw] items-center justify-center  bg-transparent text-center group-[.disable-ads]:hidden print:hidden  flex mb-0\" role=\"region\" aria-labelledby=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" data-native=\"false\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mb-8\">\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-6 text-left\">Those with dry skin should take extra care in avoiding harsh soap and heeding related tenets of shower hygiene. \u201cIf people haven\u2019t learned the lessons of skincare by their 40s, they\u2019ll pay for it in their 60s,\u201d Nazarian says.<\/p>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-6 text-left\">Another individual difference: frequent exercise with profuse sweating may create the need for more cleaning. \u201cIf you\u2019re exercising and sweating a lot, you\u2019re going to want to clean that off, because eventually it\u2019s going to build up and cause some odor,\u201d Rossi says. You\u2019ll still want to use a cleanser, though, not soap.<\/p>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-0 text-left\">Nazarian is less concerned by lots of sweating than regular skin-to-skin contact with others. \u201cThat\u2019s my exception\u201d warranting more self-cleaning, she says. If you regularly work out at boxing gyms or practice martial arts, for example, \u201cyou need a little more cleaning\u201d to wash away infectious strains of bacteria picked up from others, she says. Again, cleansers are your best weapon.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"\">\n<div class=\"p-0 mb-0\">\n<div id=\"inline-ad-8\" class=\"flex min-h-px w-full min-w-px max-w-[100vw] items-center justify-center  bg-transparent text-center group-[.disable-ads]:hidden print:hidden  flex mb-0\" role=\"region\" aria-labelledby=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" data-native=\"false\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">However, Nazarian adds that skin is less susceptible to these pathogens if it\u2019s healthy \u2014and undamaged by soap.
