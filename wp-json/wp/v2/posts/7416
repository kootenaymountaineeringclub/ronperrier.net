They like to park at the Robson tennis courts and do a variety of loops and figure 8s to visit the top of Lions Head. I tried to find the Robson tennis courts and used Google maps to scan Robson and couldn\u2019t find any tennis courts from above. I Googled them and found only two references to tennis courts in this Robson. A post on abandoned tennis courts all over North America showed courts with a hanging gate, rusty fence and trees and grass rapidly encroaching. The courts had not been used since at least the early 90s. A second post was a real estate listing on Mountain St in Robson that mentioned the Robson Community School and tennis courts. I still couldn\u2019t find the courts on Google maps! They must be very overgrown. Following Mountain Street though, led to a deep, obvious trail going up to the bench above. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> In Robson (on the north side of the Columbia River across from Castlegar), drive west down Broadwater Road to the Robson Community School. Park nearby. Mountain Street is on the west side of the school. Follow it to the end where it curves to the left and leads to the trail. Then explore. One objective is a viewpoint above the corridor cleared for the CPC power lines from Keenleyside. Follow a series of trails and old roads to reach above the corridor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are a large number of possible routes in this area due to many interconnecting trails developed over the years by walkers, bikers and horseback riders.
