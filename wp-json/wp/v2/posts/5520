With 2 million people, it is a big dirty place. There are guards in every store and fast food place &#8211; the ones in the stores have pump-action shot guns and the guys in Wendys have side arms &#8211; incredibly boring jobs. This is supposed to be the most dangerous city in Central America. Kidnappings are happening with the victims killed if ransoms are not paid within an hour. Despite warnings not to ride in the red city buses, I got cheap and did it anyway and was the only gringo &#8211; (15 cents versus $8 by taxi) and had an adventure getting incredibly lost 4 different times, but there was little else to do. The people were very nice and tried to be helpful but rarely were. I went to 3 museums and the big cathedral and that was about all to do in the city. I have an unlocked iPhone so am using local telephone networks. Sorting it all out was another adventure.<\/p>\n<p><strong>LAKE ATITLAN<\/strong><br \/>\nI then took the chicken bus and was again the only gringo on board but it only cost $4 for a 4 hour ride). On my way to Panajachal on Lake Atitlan in the highlands, it was 2 transfers to get there. The funniest thing were all the vendors that get onto the bus at every stop selling fruit, candy, and pop using a staccato selling pitch. Some distribute everything in their box around the entire bus and then pick it up again when few people buy anything. One fellow tied balloons and put on a great show. True to form there was a basket of baby chicks on the luggage rack over my head. The second ride, a Toyoto van with seats for 15, had 24 on board. The Mayans are so short that they can stand up which is handy. These trips are way more fun than the big Pullman buses.<br \/>\nLake Atitlan is possibly the second biggest tourist draw in Guatemala after Antigua. It is big, 1000 feet deep, and surrounded by many small Mayan towns and several volcanoes. Every town has a large Mayan population with a smaller \u00a8tourist\u00a8 area. After 1 day in <strong>Panajachal<\/strong>, I spent 2 in <strong>Santiago La Laguna<\/strong>, a big working town with a huge market on Fridays. It is home to Maximon, a small seated wooden figure dressed in a suit and silk scarves and a smoke in his mouth. After paying the 25 cent admission, one is expected to give alcohol, cigarettes and fruit as offerings. <\/p>\n<p><strong>SAN PEDRO LA LAGUNA<\/strong>.<br \/>\nI then spent 8 days here, a town with many old hippies, it is very touristy with people from all over the world. My nice hotel room with a private bath was about $7.50 a night and I can eat well for the same price. The fare here is cosmopolitan and you can get anything. My favourite so far has been the BBQ chorizo sausage served with guacamole, beans and onions for $1 on the street. I went to Spanish language school for 4 hours per day for 5 days. Clearly the hardest learning experience of my life, especially with little vocabulary, I had a great teacher and still learned lots. I will never be able to carry on a conversation with a fluent speaker, but am getting tired of saying no habla Espanol.<br \/>\n<strong>SAN MARCOS.<\/strong> After taking the boat across the lake to <strong>San Marcos<\/strong> (a town with many alternative businesses mostly yoga, massage and meditation), I went for breakfast at a small restaurant. The owner was a dapper English man who had moved there in 2008 from Spain where he had been a well off real estate developer (he had paid his wife 4.5 million euros as alimony at the time of his divorce in 2004). He said it was not uncommon for somebody from N Europe to come down and with no down payment, purchase a million dollar condo. The bank loan was negotiated after 15 minutes. This is the crux of the problems in Spain and other countries in Europe. No wonder their banking systems collapsed. I walked back along the dusty road to San Pedro. Another day I got up at 4 am to watch sunrise from the top of the <strong>Indian Nose<\/strong>, a high mirador above the lake. <\/p>\n<p><strong>CHICHICASTENANGO<\/strong><br \/>\nI went on a day trip. The market had everything, with stuff for the locals in the middle and all the beautiful handicrafts around the perimeter. It is easy to understand why so many gringos bring the handicrafts back to North America and resell them. Most all the brilliantly coloured cloth is manufactured and I can only hope that the locals are involved and benefit from the manufacture of all the products. The local church is mostly Mayan &#8211; possibly the only Catholic thing going on is baptisms. On the Sunday I was there, at least 50 babies were being baptized. With the families all dressed up and the babies in their finery, each kid got about 30 seconds from the priest. He finally sped things up by leaving the baptismal font and walking along the line of waiting infants using a tiny squirt bottle of holy water! The many church steps (likened to the steps leading up to a Mayan pyramid) were covered with people selling flowers and old men swinging incense burners. With few simple pews, there were people kneeling all over lighting candles and offering gifts of fruit, flowers, whiskey and cigarettes. There is a Mayan shrine on the ridge above town that is very important to the locals.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ANTIGUA<\/strong><br \/>\nThe once colonial capital of Guatemala, it is a pretty place with its many pastel colonial buildings, a gorgeous square with a big, old fountain, and ruins, the remnants of a disastrous earthquake in 1773.<br \/>\nThe old cathedrals of La Merced and San Francisco (lovely paintings on the walls) are beautiful.<br \/>\nThe church and convent of Santa Domingo have been restored and are now a very high-end hotel with several museums.<br \/>\nRoberta joined me on Dec 6 and both of us went to Spanish school. We stayed on the grounds of the school \u2013 individual casitas spread around  gorgeous gardens. The bed is larger than most of the rooms I\u00b4ve been staying in, a large bathroom with a warm shower, kitchen, dining room, living room and lovely deck. One can spend days wandering the streets, walking through all the hotels, climbing the hill to the cross on top, and shopping. My favorite t-shirt was \u00a8No I don&#8217;t want a tuk-tuk ride, a jade necklace or any f***ing cashews\u00a8. There are hundreds of jade stores. The store and street vendors are relentless.<br \/>\nOn our last day we bought a Mayan quilt, 10 gorgeous place mats, 4 pillow covers and some table runners and mailed them back home. The postage was $75.<br \/>\nThere is a large expatriate population but just like in large cities at home, nobody acknowledges you (they actually arrived about 10 weeks after mailing \u2013 I was sure they had been stolen somewhere.<\/p>\n<p>After a 36 year civil war that ended in 1996 resulting in the death of 250,000 poor people, Guatemalans still fight corrupt government. 70% of the land is owned by 3% of the population. With no social safety net, everyone works or begs and you need to have an obvious handicap to do that very successfully. There is a prominent Mayan population dressing in traditional garb everywhere.  One of the things that does get to you after a while is all the garbage. It is everywhere and nobody seems to care. Apparently there have many PhD theses written on the subject. By far the cleanest places in Central America are gas stations &#8211; spotless and swept daily.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guatamala Nov 2010 GUATEMALA CITY.
