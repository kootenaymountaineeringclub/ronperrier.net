Barbados has formed from coral and has a gentler, fertile landscape.<br \/>\nBarbados is about 32 km long and 23 km across at its widest. The island is characterized by several distinctive and in parts unique geological, geographical, biological, as well as cultural features, most of which are located in the Scotland District. The first peculiarity is the location of the entire island of Barbados, which stands in isolation in front of the Windward Islands of the Lesser Antilles. Furthermore, all those islands consist essentially of volcanic rocks, yet Barbados does not have a volcano but instead has a base of sedimentary rocks that are covered by terraces of carbonate rocks. Barbados also has an amazing array of sedimentary rock formations and structural geological features, including mud diapirs, the largest of which is in the subsurface of the Scotland District.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nCapital:<\/strong>\u00a0Bridgetown<br \/>\n<strong>Currency:<\/strong>\u00a0Barbadian Dollar (BBD)<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Bajan dollar, Bds$, B$.

The exact origin of its name is not known but rumour has it that it was named after George Nicholas, husband to Berringer\u2019s granddaughter, Susanna. Berringer was killed in a duel with his neighbor,\u00a0Sir John Yeamans, who then married Berringer\u2019s widow and claimed the abbey as his property. In 1669, the Colonel\u2019s children took the matter to court and were awarded ownership of the property. Sir John and his wife then moved to British America, where they helped found\u00a0South Carolina. The house was later acquired by the eminent baronet, planter, and legislator,\u00a0Sir John Gay Alleyne (1746 until his death in 1801). He planted the impressive mahogany avenue leading to\u00a0Cherry Tree Hill.<br \/>\nThe abbey was no longer a functioning plantation after 1947.\u00a0Sugar has been grown on the plantation since 1640 and there is still evidence of the\u00a0mill\u00a0and sugar-making edifices. The cane is now trucked eight miles to the Portvale Sugar Factory for processing.<br \/>\nSince 2006, the abbey is owned by local Barbadian architect, Larry Warren.\u00a0Warren built the\u00a0St. Nicholas Abbey Heritage Railway\u00a0on his estate, which was completed by the end of 2018.<br \/>\nSt Nicholas Abbey is currently a well-preserved museum, successfully recreating 18th-century plantation life complete with;\u00a0Wedgwood pottery,\u00a0Chippendale furniture,\u00a0curvilinear\u00a0Dutch gables\u00a0with tall\u00a0finials\u00a0of carved coral stone, and corner\u00a0chimneys.

With sugarcane\u2019s intensely demanding and unforgiving agro-industrial process, it condemned the enslaved Africans to lifelong physical and psychological abuse. Slavery defined the Atlantic World with its total reliance on African forced labour producing the primary materials that drove European mercantile economies. The plantation complex lay at the core of colonial societies from Brazil and the West Indies to the American mainland and West Africa. Enslaved Africans\u2019 blood, sweat, and tears forged complex international trade, social, and political networks in the Atlantic World. Enslaved Africans, in spite of their bondage, resisted their enslavement in every possible way from day-to-day acts of resistance to slow productivity on estates to marronage and open rebellion.<br \/>\nFrom 1643 until very recent times, sugar and rum production has been the mainstay of the Barbadian economy.\u00a0 As a result, the tropical islands of the Caribbean became the strategic centre of the Atlantic World and were vehemently defended and fought over in European conflicts throughout the 17th and 19th centuries.<br \/>\nWith its sugarcane fields, plantation complexes, mill infrastructure, and factories, nestling on the slopes and in the valleys\/ gullies of the island, illustrate the impact of human settlement, slave labour, and agricultural activities on the natural landscape.<br \/>\nThese social and economic patterns were then exported to the rest of the Caribbean including Charles Towne (later Charleston, South Carolina).<br \/>\nThe Sugar Revolution had six central elements: \u201ca shift from diversified agriculture to sugar monoculture, from production on small farms to large plantations, from free to slave labour, from sparse to dense settlement, from white to black populations, and from low to high value per capita output.\u201d The intensive use of advanced and efficient windmill technologies increased the output of muscovado, and the local clays in the refinement process increased the quality of muscovado produced in Barbados.<br \/>\nUsed as an alternative to water, the locally consumed \u2018killdevil\u2019 or \u2018rumbuillion\u2019 which is today known as rum, was first produced in Barbados on all plantations for local consumption and export, becoming a staple in British naval victuals in the 18th\u00a0and 19th\u00a0centuries. As demand increased, rum distillation quickly became a feature of most sugar plantations across the region.<br \/>\nAll of the plantations can be traced to 17th-century\u00a0militia landowners who first developed plantation estates. Leveraging the rudimentary road network and jetties, plantations took advantage of sea routes to Bridgetown. Land consolidation through marriage and intricate bequests kept land holdings together through the generations.<br \/>\n<strong>1. Codrington College<\/strong>\u2013 A college that was first used as a sugar plantation and now\u00a0an\u00a0Anglican theological college in\u00a0St. John, affiliated with the\u00a0University of the West Indies at Cave Hill. It is the oldest\u00a0Anglican\u00a0theological college\u00a0in the\u00a0Western Hemisphere.<br \/>\nCodrington College was founded with the profits from the bequest of\u00a0Christopher Codrington, who after his death in 1710 left portions of his sugar cane estates. As the sugar cane estates were still operating, the Society and the College benefited directly from the forced labour of African slaves.\u00a0Codrington Plantations\u00a0continued to use slave labour and even branded the word \u201cSociety\u201d on the chests of slaves.\u00a0Slavery only ended when the\u00a0Slavery Abolition Act\u00a0was enacted in 1833. At that time, in accordance with the\u00a0Slave Compensation Act 1837, the Society received funding (a little over \u00a38,823 for 411 slaves) as compensation for the loss of the slave labour, as was the case for all slave owners.<br \/>\n<strong>2. Morgan Lewis Windmill,\u00a0<\/strong>St. Andrew,\u00a0Barbados the last\u00a0sugar windmill\u00a0to operate in\u00a0Barbados. The mill stopped operating in 1947, was restored, and\u00a0is one of only two working sugar windmills in the world today. During February through July, its sails are put in place and it operates one Sunday in each month, grinding cane and providing cane juice. Around the interior of the mill, wall is a museum of sugar mill and plantation artifacts, and an exhibition of old photographs. Visitors can climb to the top of the mill.<br \/>\n<strong>3. St Nicholas Abbey<\/strong>is a\u00a0plantation house, museum, and\u00a0rum distillery built by\u00a0Colonel\u00a0Benjamin Berringer in 1658. This house is one of only three genuine\u00a0Jacobean\u00a0mansions in the\u00a0Western Hemisphere, the period between the\u00a0Tudor\u00a0and\u00a0Georgian\u00a0styles, beginning in the reign of\u00a0James I.<br \/>\nNicholas Abbey has no church connection, it has always been a sugarcane plantation house. The exact origin of its name is not known.<br \/>\nThe ho\u00a0St use had a succession of owners and families. Sir John Gay Alleyne (lived here from 1746-1801) planted the impressive mahogany avenue leading to\u00a0Cherry Tree Hill.<br \/>\nSugar has been grown on the plantation since 1640 and there is still the evidence of the\u00a0mill\u00a0and sugar making edifices. Sugar was processed on the property until 1947, the cane is now trucked eight miles to the Portvale Sugar Factory for processing.<br \/>\nSince 2006, the abbey is owned by local Barbadian architect, Larry Warren. Warren built the\u00a0St. Nicholas Abbey Heritage Railway\u00a0on his estate, which was completed by the end of 2018.<br \/>\nSt Nicholas Abbey is currently a well-preserved museum, successfully recreating 18th-century plantation life complete with;\u00a0Wedgwood pottery,\u00a0Chippendale furniture,\u00a0curvilinear\u00a0Dutch gables\u00a0with tall\u00a0finials\u00a0of carved coral stone and corner\u00a0chimneys.

Newton Slave Burial Ground\u2013<\/strong>The remains of nearly 600 slaves were found on the grounds of the former Newton Plantation, in use from 1670\u20131833, at a cemetery consisting of low mounds.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Scotland District of Barbados.<\/strong>\u00a0Tentative WHS (18\/01\/2005). The highest elevation of Barbados is Mount Hillaby in the Scotland District, 340 m above sea level. Although small by comparison to some of the volcanoes in the islands of the Lesser Antilles, Mount Hillaby, and with it the Scotland District of Barbados, is the summit of an elongated submarine mountain range that is several hundred km long, extending from Trinidad to about Puerto Rico. The Scotland District is the only location in the entire Caribbean where this mountain range is above water. Geologically this range is called an \u201caccretionary prism\u201d, which is a thick wedge of sediments that forms on the ocean floor at the junction of two tectonic plates that are pushed together, such as the Atlantic and the Caribbean plates. Continuing compression further deforms and pushes the accretionary prism upwards. The island of Barbados is growing in size as a result. Physiographically, the Scotland District appears as a half bowl containing the hilly highlands of Barbados, with a dense, in parts jungle-like vegetation, quite unlike the rest of the island, which is rather flat, deforested, and commonly used for agriculture. The overall shape of the Scotland District is that of a round bowl cut in half by the Atlantic ocean that borders along the straight east coast, with sand beaches and dunes. The remainder of the Scotland District is bordered by a variably steep cliff face. The lively topography in the interior of the half bowl is the result of the interplay of complex tectonic folding, faulting, and surface erosion, which commonly leads to landslides. These also are the reasons why the Scotland District is relatively sparsely populated and not used for agriculture, except in some very small pockets. The Scotland district contains rocks about 30 to 50 million years old, namely clay stones, sand- and siltstones, volcanic ash layers, chalk, and radiolarite (chert or flint, when hardened), as well as some odd rock formations such as mineral concretions that resemble huge canon balls. Most of these rocks are folded and faulted in a complex way. Oil has formed from some of the rock layers, and the so-called Scotland Sandstone hosts several oil fields at depths of about 1,000 to 2,000 m. Oil even reaches the surface in a few natural oil seeps in the Scotland District. In some locations the oil is oxidized and solidified to tar-like substance called \u2018manjak\u2019.<br \/>\n<strong>Morgan Lewis Mill,\u00a0<\/strong>St Andrew.

The 6-acre authentic garden was created by Iris Bannochie, a female, Barbadian, self-taught scientist. It is unique, having been created in the 1950s as both a private botanical garden and a pleasure garden by an individual\u00a0around Ms. Bannochie\u2019s home. She was a mentor to many and was considered the queen of Barbadian horticulture. At one point, she was responsible for introducing over 80% of the ornamental plants found in Barbados.<br \/>\nAndromeda has over five hundred different species of plants adapted to a range of tropical environments: 50 species of palm, 100 different tree species, and 90 plant families, one of the most plant-diverse gardens in the tropical world.<br \/>\nAt the center of the upper garden is a majestic native\u00a0banyan.<br \/>\n<strong>Ragged Point Lighthouse.\u00a0<\/strong>On\u00a0the easternmost point of the island, it\u00a0is an 85-foot coral stone structure that was erected in 1875 at over 200 feet above sea level. Its light goes 21 miles and is considered Barbados\u2019 most significant lighthouse, protecting sailors from the turbulent Atlantic coastline and the hazardous Cobbler\u2019s Reef, where 22 shipwrecks were logged during the fifty years preceding its construction.<br \/>\nOn a clear day, you can see all the way up the coastline to the northern points of the island such as\u00a0Cove Bay\u00a0and Pico Tenerife. Off the coast lies\u00a0Culpepper Island, a tiny island that can be reached by swimming at low tide.

East of the airport are fewer hotels, the coast trends north-east and becomes rugged and the seas are stronger.<strong><br \/>\nSam Lord\u2019s Castle.\u00a0<\/strong>Sam Lord (1778 \u2013 1844) was one of the most famous\u00a0buccaneers\u00a0on\u00a0Barbados. Lord amassed great wealth for his castle-mansion\u00a0in\u00a0Barbados. He did this through the direct plundering of ships stranded in the\u00a0coral reefs\u00a0just off the coast of his estate. According to legend, Sam Lord would hang lanterns high in the\u00a0coconut\u00a0trees around his estate. Passing ships far out at sea would think it was the port city of\u00a0Bridgetown\u00a0and would sail towards the reef in the area, leading them to wreck their ships. Sam Lord would then board the ships and keep the riches for his castle.<br \/>\nEventually, his\u00a0castle\u00a0estate was turned into a\u00a0hotel\u00a0called the\u00a0<em>Sam Lord\u2019s Castle<\/em>.

With its serpentine urban lay-out the property testifies to a different approach to colonial town-planning compared to the Spanish and Dutch colonial cities of the region which were built along a grid plan.Bridgetown was the earliest established town with a fortified port in the Caribbean network of military and maritime-mercantile outposts of the British Atlantic. It was the focus of trade-based English expansion in the Americas as an entrep\u00f4t for goods, especially sugar, and enslaved persons destined for Barbados and the rest of the Americas.<br \/>\nThe 17th century street layout is English medieval type with organic serpentine streets and creolized forms of architecture, including Caribbean Georgian.<br \/>\nThe fortified port spaces were linked along the Bay Street corridor from the historic town\u2019s centre to St. Ann\u2019s Garrison. The property\u2019s natural harbour, Carlisle Bay, was the first port of call on the trans-Atlantic crossing.

The hilly east coast is exposed to the full fury of the Atlantic, with big surf, and is too hazardous for casual beach and water sports.<br \/>\nBotanical gardens are mostly in the hilly, less-developed country of Central Eastern Barbados.<br \/>\n<strong>Flower Forest Botanical Gardens,<\/strong>\u00a0St. Thomas. Scenic garden park with attractive\u00a0flowering plants\u00a0and\u00a0tropical\u00a0trees on\u00a050-acre (200,000\u00a0m2), a former sugar plantation.\u00a0Collections of\u00a0Heliconias,\u00a0ginger lilies,\u00a0bromeliads,\u00a0anthurium lilies, and other tropical flowers presently provide a flowering base underneath tall, indigenous\u00a0Caribbean Royal palms, which grow wild in the Scotland District of Barbados.<strong><em><br \/>\n<\/em>Harrison\u2019s Cave.\u00a0<\/strong>First mentioned in 1795, they were rediscovered in the early 1970s and developed by the government as part of a tram tour, and opened to the public in 1981.<br \/>\nIt is in the central uplands (gullies, sinkholes, and caverns) at 700 feet (210\u00a0m) above sea level. The caves are naturally formed by water\u00a0erosion\u00a0through the\u00a0limestone\u00a0rock.<br \/>\nTraveling through the caves is by\u00a0tram. One main area of the caves is a huge cavern, termed \u201c<em>The Great Hall<\/em>\u201c, measuring over 50 feet (15\u00a0m) in height. \u201c<em>The Village<\/em>\u201d some of the formations have joined together to form columns after thousands of years. Other areas are\u00a0\u201cThe Chapel,\u201d \u201cThe Rotunda,\u201d and \u201cThe Altar.\u201d Visitors travel through the Boyce Tunnel via tram to all depths of the cave.<br \/>\nFrom the Tram Tour through the caves where you can learn more about the cave\u2019s history, as well as learning more about the natural structures found within it, to the Eco-Adventure Tour where you can walk through the cave itself, crawling on your hands and knees. Prices do vary, with the Eco-adventure Tour costing more, and requiring you to book in advance. However, they also offer Walk-In Cave Tours on the last Saturday of every month. The Walk-In Cave Tours are exactly the same as the Eco-Adventure Tours, and do not require prior booking, and are also cheaper if you want to go with a small group of people.<br \/>\n<strong>Hunter\u2019s Gardens,\u00a0<\/strong>St. Joseph. In a naturally formed gully are an array of tropical flowers, trees and foliage along with statues, antiques and other beautiful decorative pieces.\u00a0Admission: US$15 per person<br \/>\n<strong>Fisherpond House.<\/strong>\u00a0House Museums\/Plantations.\u00a0It\u2019s believed that the Fisherpond Great House was built either in the 16th or 17th century. It was once owned by several individuals \u2013 first there was Sir Marmaduke Rawdon, who, sometime between 1628 &amp; 1630 had secured land from the Earl of Carlisle, \u2018owner\u2019 of Barbados.\u00a0 Marmaduke owned Fisherpond and Rawdon plantations. As well, he owned several merchant ships and properties in London. He was knighted by the King sometime in 1643. He died in 1646. His son Thomas, became new owner of Fisherpond, until 1666.<br \/>\nThe property was sold several more times. In the 1800s, it belonged to Thomas Hollingsworth, whose Will was published \u2013 Fisherpond plantation and his other estate to be sold after the harvesting of the crop, so there would be\u00a0sufficient money which he could list in his Will to be left to several people including his brother\u2019s widow, his aunt &amp; sister, \u201cmy illegitimate\u201d child and her mother. He also left an inheritance to his female slave \u201cfor the purpose of freeing her.\u201d\u00a0 He left his friend William Grassett as the executor of his Will.<br \/>\nWe note that soon after, William Grassett was the owner of Fisherpond Plantation until the mid-1800s. The property then changed hands a few more times.<br \/>\nIn the 21st century, the property, owned by John &amp; Rain Chandler, has become the place to have Sunday lunch, by appointment.\u00a0 You must call ahead also on other days.\u00a0 You\u2019ll be in good company as the Queen of England and some of her grandchildren have had lunch at the Fisherpond.\u00a0 As well the British Prime Minister Tony Blair, also sat at the dining table for 24, at the Fisherpond Great House.<br \/>\nThe plantation home which was lovingly restored and filled with antiques.\u00a0<em>Please note that Fisherpond is no longer open to the public.\u00a0<\/em>The grounds of Fisherpond were ablaze with tropical flora while fountains and water features complete the charming atmosphere.<br \/>\n<strong>Orchid World &amp; Tropical Flower Garden<\/strong>, St George. On six acres surrounded by sugarcane at an elevation of 810ft, follow a self-guided tour past a waterfall, through a coral grotto, and eventually through five orchid houses. Vandas, Phalaenopsis, Calanthes, Cattlyeas, Ascocendas and Dendrobiums, just to name a few, can be found throughout. Vandas and Ascocendas, \u2018rain forest\u2019 orchids, are displayed in an environment meant to be a simulation of the condition in which they would grow in the rain forest. This simulation is an eye-catching display, as they seem to hang in mid-air with the orchids\u2019 roots completely free of soil.<br \/>\n<strong>Sunbury Plantation House<\/strong>.\u00a0House Museums\/Plantations. Was built around 1660 by Matthew Chapman, an Irish\/English planter, one of the first settlers on the island. He was related to the Earl of Carlisle and through this association, was granted lands in Barbados. Sunbury Plantation House is over 300 years old, steeped in history, featuring mahogany antiques, old prints, and a unique collection of horse-drawn carriages. This is the only great house with all rooms available for viewing. The\u00a0Courtyard Restaurant\u00a0and bar offers refreshments to visitors daily.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>What to Do?<\/strong>\u00a0Rent a car or scooter and drive around the island. There are 27 Nomad Mania sights spread evenly around the island including 4 botanical gardens, 4 beaches, 2 caves, 1 lighthouse, 2 churches, 7 museums in Bridgetown, and a mixed variety of other sights.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Get Around<br \/>\n<\/strong><em>By Bus.<\/em>\u00a0The bus system is extensive, cheap, and fast.<br \/>\n<em>By Taxi.<\/em>\u00a0With reasonable prices, they do not use meters and it is best to negotiate the price before you get in.<br \/>\n<em>By Car.<\/em>\u00a0Renting a car is expensive, the roads quite narrow, with sharp turns, steep inclines, and are generally quite bumpy, although most are paved. Many do not have sidewalks, so there can be pedestrians. The exception is the ABC highway.<br \/>\n<em>By Scooter<\/em>\u00a0may be hazardous due to the lack of sidewalks, frequent potholes, sharp corners, and speeding local buses.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Eat.\u00a0<\/strong>Bajan cuisine is an odd mix of spicy, flavorful treats along with traditional English fayre \u2013 fiery stews accompany beans on toast. The yellow sauce is very hot Scotch Bonnet peppers with onions in a mustard sauce.\u00a0<em>Cutters<\/em>\u00a0are sandwiches made from bread and popular fillings like flying fish, ham or cheese. Eat at street vendors offer snacks like fish cakes, BBQ pigtails, fresh coconut, and roasted peanuts.<br \/>\n<strong>Drink<\/strong>. Rum and rum-based drinks are featured at every bar. For tours of a rum distillery, Mount Gay (the brand leader) and Southern Barbados. Banks Beer is Barbados\u2019 own brew.<\/p>\n<p><strong>See<br \/>\nBotanical gardens<\/strong>\u00a0are mostly in the hilly, less-developed country of Central Eastern Barbados. The standout is Andromeda Gardens, near Bathsheba. Others include Hunte\u2019s Gardens, Flower Forest, and Orchid World.<br \/>\n<strong>Grand houses<\/strong>\u00a0from the plantation and colonial eras. Those routinely open for visits include the George Washington House and Wildey House in Bridgetown, and Sunbury Plantation House and Codrington College in Central Eastern Barbados. Several others are only open on special occasions, such as the Open House days in Jan-March. But you really need to time your visit to dodge the coach parties and cruise ship excursions. While that applies to any tourist attraction on Barbados, it\u2019s especially true for these houses \u2013 they\u2019re grand but not palatial, and cramming into a Georgian four-poster bedroom with fifty other amply-fed folk takes the gloss off the experience.<br \/>\n<strong>Do<br \/>\nDiving in Barbados.\u00a0<\/strong>Scuba diving here is boat-based, as the main reefs and wrecks are too far out for comfortable shore-diving. Most dive shacks are in Bridgetown (see listings) but pick up from hotels along the coast between Speightstown and Oistins:<br \/>\n<strong>Watch\u00a0cricket<\/strong>\u00a0at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown. West Indies play as a combined team for international matches (\u201cTest matches\u201d, lasting up to five days). Barbados also competes as a nation in other competitions in the Caribbean region. First-class matches are sometimes played at other venues around the island, but the big games are always at the Oval.<br \/>\n<strong>Visit a rum distillery.<\/strong>\u00a0Three distilleries are in production: Mount Gay in Bridgetown is the best known (M-F Sa Nov-Apr).
