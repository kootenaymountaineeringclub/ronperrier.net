This man traveled through the central Arctic (all to towns that I have worked in) over 15 months in 1938-39. The book gives many interesting observations about the Inuit.

A fascinating look into Hutterite life. I was originally from Southern Alberta where there were many Hutterites. It was very illuminating to see communal living at its ultimate and the difficulties of leaving the colony.<br \/>\n<strong>*Adventures and Sufferings of John Jewitt<\/strong>. One of the most amazing books. Recently had the chance to reread this in an edition with drawings and annotations. Very enjoyable. About an English merchant boat where, in 1802, the natives of Nootka Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island murdered 23 of the crew and took two into slavery for almost 3 years before they were rescued. A unique anthropological study especially improved with all the supplemental information provided by Hilary Stewart.<br \/>\n<strong>Agatha Christie<\/strong> &#8211; Clocks.

A must-read for anyone interested in Christianity, especially those creationists and evangelicals who take the bible literally (although they probably would not accept any of it, so may be a waste of time for them).<br \/>\n<strong>Infidel My Life<\/strong>: Ayaan Hirsi Ali &#8211; A Somali woman raised in a strict Muslim society (she was circumcised as a child), lives in Kenya and Saudi Arabia and then moves to Holland as an immigrant. She gets an education, fights for the rights of Muslim women and children and becomes a member of parliament.

Two Brits who made documentary films on Indonesia back in 70-80s.<br \/>\n<strong>Krakatoa<\/strong> &#8211; Simon Winchester.

Written by his personal physician of 22 years. Mao was a true whacko: not educated, never brushed his teeth or bathed and wiped down with warm wet towels so never washed his genitals, a sexual monster with 100s (1000s?) of short adventures with nurses, dancers and anyone young. Details the misadventures of the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution. He could care less if millions died as &#8220;China had lots of people&#8221;. An interesting bit about preserving his body &#8220;forever&#8221; &#8211; let&#8217;s face all these are wax. Both Lenin and Ho Chi Minh had significant rot after a few years.<br \/>\n<strong>The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao<\/strong> &#8211; Junot Diaz. Winner in the BBC Culture Critics\u2019 poll and the Pulitzer Prize in fiction. About New Jersey ghetto-nerd Oscar, it reaffirms the strong connections Latinos maintain with their ancestral homeland\u2019s culture, language and history.

A chilling account of Trujillo&#8217;s dictatorship in the Dominican Republic.<br \/>\n<strong>*The Known World<\/strong> &#8211; Edward P Jones. Set in 1855 on the plantation of a black slave owner \u2013 this is a stunning work about humans experiencing and surviving American slavery &#8211; an epic, complex, unflinching and engrossing view of America&#8217;s messy history. #2 on the BBC Culture Critics Poll.<br \/>\n<strong>*The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay<\/strong> &#8211; Michael Chabon, Pulitzer Prize winner. Joe Kavalier, a Houdini-like escape artist, smuggles himself out of Nazi-occupied Prague in 1939 and ends up in New York City. With his Brooklyn cousin Sammy Clay, he invents a superhero character called the Escapist and launches the golden age of comic books. Hilarious, this is the second book I have read by Chabon &#8211; he is the best.<br \/>\n<strong>The Corrections<\/strong> (2001) \u2013 Jonathan Franzen. Winner of a US National Book Award, this big, sprawling, fat, edgy multigenerational family saga touches on some of the most important themes of the early years of this millennium \u2013 economic uncertainty, the conflicts between parents and their drifting middle-aged children and the enormous issues of an aging society past its prime. He does it with great storytelling and a lot of humour.<br \/>\n<strong>Solar<\/strong> &#8211; Ian McEwan (Atonement). Clever book. Picked up in a hostel in Tel Aviv and nice to read the paper again.<br \/>\n<strong>Bad-Assed Librarians<\/strong> by Joshua Hammer &#8211; Timbuktu has been the repository of Islamic and historical literature for North Africa for over a century. When threatened by terrorists, 372,000 of the 377,000 manuscripts were smuggled out and are now stored in Bamako, the capital of Mali.<br \/>\n<strong>Sapiens, Homo Deus<\/strong>.

Juxtaposes timeless literary themes, most notably the inexorable journey from youth to age, with an exploration of how a rapidly changing world reshapes the human experience.<br \/>\n<strong>No Way Down<\/strong> &#8211; Graham Bowley. Relates the story of the climb of K2 in 2008 when 11 climbers died &#8211; another story of too many people on a mountain who despite the goals of cooperation, didn&#8217;t.<br \/>\n<strong>*The Enigma<\/strong> \u2013 The life of Alan Turing, a genius in the class of Newton, Darwin and Einstein.<br \/>\n<strong>The Year of Living Danishly<\/strong> \u2013 Uncovering the Secrets of the World\u2019s Happiest Country.

Every country should have one of these and I would love to see one on Japan and South Korea. \u201cBeing Indian\u201d is great about India.<br \/>\n<strong>Prisoners of Geography<\/strong> \u2013 Ten Maps That Explain Everything About the World. Tim Marshall. A concise overview of the world\u2019s history and how differing geography affected history. Very informative.<br \/>\n<strong>The Five Love Languages<\/strong> \u2013 How to Express Heartfelt Commitment to Your Mate \u2013 Gary Chapman. A must-read for anyone in a relationship \u2013 couples and families with children. One more way to look at relationships, but possibly the easiest to put into practice. The five languages are Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Receiving Gifts, Acts of Service or Physical Touch.<br \/>\n<strong>When Breath Becomes Air<\/strong> \u2013 Paul Kalanithi. A neurosurgery resident develops terminal lung cancer and finds god.<br \/>\n<strong>Heart of Darkness<\/strong> \u2013 Joseph Conrad. One of the worst books I have ever read. I was in the Congo when I read it and learned nothing about the Congo. The book is wordy description and all about Kurtz, a trader who appears briefly at the end of the book. I had traded Kindles with another passenger and there was not much to read in his Kindle, but I did stick it out.<br \/>\n<strong>We Were Soldiers Once\u2026.And Young<\/strong> \u2013 la Drang \u2013 the Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam \u2013 Lt. Gen. Harold G. Moore (Ret) and Joseph L Galloway. About the first big battle in Vietnam. 306 Americans and 4000 Viet Cong lost their lives. The book is an endless story of death. The best part may be the very end when they discuss the decision to continue the war. 58,000 Americans were eventually killed. I would not recommend reading this book.<br \/>\n<strong>Shadow of the Silk Road<\/strong> \u2013 Colin Thubron. Interesting with much history but his writing gets a little boring.<br \/>\n<strong>In Xanadu<\/strong> \u2013 Willian Dalrymple Does the road from the Middle East to Beijing. This is the first book I have read by this English travel writer and I want to read more. He is very entertaining with a great sense of humour and an eye for travelling. Much better than the previous book on the \u201cSilk Road\u201d.<br \/>\n<strong>*A World Without Us<\/strong> &#8211; Alan Weisman. A great read about many fascinating subjects about how we have impacted our planet and how long these effects will last.<br \/>\n<strong>No Picnic on Mount Kenya<\/strong> &#8211; Felice Benuzzi. 3 POWs from a prisoner of war camp in Kenya escape and climb the mountain then return to the camp.<br \/>\n<strong>SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome<\/strong> &#8211; Mary Beard. SPQR (Senatus Populus Que Romanus). A masterly new chronicle, by Britain\u2019s most engaging historian of the ancient world, about Rome from its myth-shrouded origins to the early third century. She shows that the key to its dominance was granting citizenship to so many people.<br \/>\n<strong>*The Underground Railroad<\/strong> &#8211; Colton Whitehead. A Pulitzer Prize-winning book.<br \/>\n<strong>Neurotribes: The Legacy of Autism and the Future of Neurodiversity<\/strong>. By Steve Silberman. How a widely contested condition grew out of conflicts between Nazi psychiatrists anxious for career advancement. The descriptions of how autistic children were treated in the 20th century is especially shocking. Winner of the 2015 Samuel Johnson prize for non-fiction. While reading this book, I came to believe that I am autistic &#8211;\u00a0 a high-functioning Asperger.<br \/>\n<strong>The Journal of Best Practices: A Memoir of Marriage, Asperger Syndrome, and One Man\u2019s Quest to Be a Better Husband<\/strong>\u00a0by\u00a0David Finch<br \/>\n<strong>Aspergers in Love: Couple Relationships and Family Affairs <\/strong>by\u00a0Maxine Aston,\u00a0Christopher Slater-Walker<br \/>\n<strong>The Complete Guide to Asperger\u2019s Syndrome<\/strong> by Tony Attwood.

A fascinating book about all things whale.<br \/>\n<strong>The Power of Neurodiversity<\/strong> &#8211; Thomas Armstrong, PhD. Discusses the positive aspects of ADHD, dyslexia, autism, mood disorders, anxiety, intelligence, and schizophrenia. See my book High-Functioning Aspergers Syndrome as a summary of this book is there.<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>A Brief History of Seven Killings<\/strong> &#8211; Malon James. Man Booker winner 2015. About Jamaican gangs in Kingston, Miami and New York. Not so interesting with some characters that seem to add little to the story (a CIA agent and a woman who appears in all three sections). A lot of dialogue and swearing.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<strong>Plucked: A History of Hair Removal.<\/strong> By Rebecca Herzig. Most of Earth\u2019s mammals possess luxuriant fur. Only one seeks to remove it. A curious account of hair-erasing, and why people have tried clamshell razors, lasers, lye depilatories, tweezers, waxes, threading and electrolysis to try and free themselves from hairiness. Self-enhancement or oppression?<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Breasts and Eggs<\/strong> &#8211; Kieko Kawakami. A novel about womanhood in Japan, but a harsh description of Japanese society.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Empire of Cotton:<\/strong> A Global History. By Sven Beckert. By focusing on a sector that until 1900 was the world\u2019s most important manufacturing industry, Sven Beckert offers a fine account of 900 years of globalisation.<br \/>\n<strong>Harpoon of the Hunter<\/strong> &#8211; Markoosie. Based on an Inuit legend, Harpoon of the Hunter is a story of life in the old days, not as it appeared to Southerners, but as it has survived in the memory of the Inuit themselves. Emerging from a largely oral tradition, it is the first novel by an Inuit written in English. Markoosie has the rare ability to capture the richness and imagery of the Inuit language in English.<br \/>\n<strong>The Satanic Verses:<\/strong> Salman Rushdie.<br \/>\n<strong>*Tales From the Ant World<\/strong> &#8211; Edward O Wilson. Fascinating (The Superorganism, Journey to the Ants, Insect Societies)<br \/>\n<strong>***The Meaning of Human Existence<\/strong> &#8211; Edward O Wilson. One of the best books I have ever read, especially the section on Are there Extraterrestrials?<br \/>\n<strong>**First Steps<\/strong> &#8211; Jeremy De Silva &#8211; Another fascinating book about bipedalism &#8211; the first thing that started the separation of humans from primates from our common ancestor, about 8 million years ago. Has a great section on walking that I have reproduced on my About and Hiking pages.<br \/>\n<strong>**A History of the Human Brain<\/strong> &#8211; Bret Stetka. A fascinating look at the evolution of the human brain, the ultimate creation.<br \/>\n<strong>The Dawn of Everything<\/strong> &#8211; David Graeber. Reexamines the premise that after hunter-gatherers, we did not turn into selfish war-like people caused by the trappings of modern civilization. Unfortunately, it is written in a rather boring, repetitive style.<br \/>\n<strong>*The Vital Question: Why Is Life the Way It Is?<\/strong> By Nick Lane. A persuasive and demanding attempt, by a thought-provoking British scientist, a biochemist at University College London, to answer some of the most fundamental questions in biology. It posits a new theory of how life came to be.<br \/>\n<strong>Man&#8217;s Search for Meaning<\/strong> &#8211; Victor Frankl.

One of the most read and reprinted books of all time.<br \/>\n<strong>Seven Brief Lessons on Physics.<\/strong> By Carlo Rovelli. Translated by Simon Carnell and Erica Segre. A startling and illustrative distillation of centuries of science by an Italian theoretical physicist. Simon Carnell and Erica Segre, a poet and a translator, have preserved the book\u2019s lyrical and stripped-down prose.<br \/>\n<strong>*How to Change Your Mind:<\/strong> Michael Pollan. Another great book by Pollan. It will want you to try psychedelics, a class of drugs making a resurgence to treat addictions, depression, dealing with dying from cancer and finding your spiritual inner being.<br \/>\n<strong>The New Jim Crow.<\/strong> How mass incarceration and the war on drugs have become the new way to subjugate blacks in America. Unfortunately written in a very repetitive style and could have been one-third the size.<br \/>\n<strong>*War Doctor:<\/strong> David Nott. A compelling story of a British surgeon who repetitively goes to the hell-spots of the world &#8211; Darfur Sudan, CAR, and the worst Syria. Recommended by Dr Rich Davis, an American surgeon working in Kenya.<br \/>\n<strong>Testaments:<\/strong> Margaret Atwood. The follow-up book to &#8220;The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale&#8221; and the fall of Gilead. Great Book by a wonderful Canadian author.<br \/>\n<strong>*The Hospital by the River:<\/strong> Dr Catherine Hamlin. One of the best medical books I have ever read and heartily recommended. It is about Drs Reg and Catherine Hamlin, an Australian obstetrician\/gynecologist couple who went to Ethiopia and eventually established a world-famous fistula hospital in Addis Ababa. Heart rendering. May 2024.<br \/>\nThis book and War Doctor (above) were both recommended to me by Dr Richard Davis who I met on a beach <\/span>in Lamu, Kenya. We talked for a long time about medicine and Asperger&#8217;s. Dr Davis has devoted his life to work as a surgeon in Africa. He also wrote the <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Manual of Surgery in Resource Limited Setting.<br \/>\n<strong>**The Covenant of Water<\/strong> &#8211; Abraham Verghese. About Kerala, India 1900-77. A family is stricken by multigenerational drownings due to an inherited acoustic neuroma that produces disorientation in water. It also includes a great intuitive Danish Physician and the birth of a breech baby by the matriarch of the family. Leprosy is a major thread throughout the book.\u00a0 Verghese also wrote &#8220;Cutting for Stone&#8221;, both wonderful reads full of great medicine.<br \/>\n<strong>*Shark Going Inland is My Chief &#8211; <\/strong>A good book about navigation used to settle the South Pacific and a thorough history of Hawaii.<br \/>\n<\/span><strong>Shuggie Bain<\/strong> &#8211; Douglas Stuart. Won the Man Booker Prize. Life in Glasgow, Scotland. Good writing but it gets depressing.<br \/>\n<strong>James Patterson.<\/strong> Triple Cross. The first book I have read by this famous who-done-it author. An entertaining book with many twists and turns.<br \/>\n<strong>Zadie Smith.<\/strong> On Beauty. Well written but not my kind of story.<br \/>\n<strong>The Surgeon of Crowthorne<\/strong> &#8211; Simon Winchester. The intriguing account of the writing of the Oxford English Dictionary. This monumental task required almost 5 decades. The book is about James Murray, the editor, and the main contributor to the dictionary, an American army surgeon incarcerated in an insane asylum (he had paranoid schizophrenia)\u00a0 for a murder in London. Highly recommended.<br \/>\n<strong>The Perfectionists<\/strong> &#8211; Simon Winchester. Another great book dealt with his great expertise.<br \/>\n<strong>The Grimkes &#8211;<\/strong> The Legasy of Slavery in an American Family &#8211; Kerry K Greenwich. Multigenerational from slaveowners, white abolitionists, and the black upper class in NE USA.<br \/>\n<strong>Knife<\/strong> &#8211; Salman Rushdie. The story of his assassination attempt and how he dealt with it.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>ON MY READING LIST<\/strong>\u00a0<\/span><\/div>\n<div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">This is so long and eclectic because I ask many fellow travellers what their favourite books are and add them to the list. I also use the book reviews in Atlantic and Time to get ideas.<br \/>\n<strong>The River at the Centre of the Earth<\/strong> &#8211; Simon Winchester.

How a multinational Muslim empire was destroyed by the First World War, by a historian of the 20th century who is director of the Middle East Centre at Oxford University.<br \/>\n<strong>Black Earth:<\/strong> The Holocaust as History and Warning. By Timothy Snyder. A historian at Yale University has made a detailed study of where Jews were in most danger during the Second World War. In France and Italy, three-quarters of the Jews survived. In eastern territories, which suffered \u201cdouble occupation\u201d, first by the Soviets and then by the Nazis, at least 90% of them perished.<br \/>\n<strong>White Teeth<\/strong> &#8211; Zadie Smith, Won the Whitbread and Guardian first book awards.

At 14, Calliope Stephanides discovers she has a rare recessive mutation that renders her a pseudo-hermaphrodite. Claiming her \u201cmale brain\u201d, she shifts genders and becomes Cal. Ultimately Cal\u2019s condition gives him a near-mythic gift \u2013 the ability to communicate between the genders, to see not with the monovision of one sex but in the stereoscope of both. Middlesex bridged the gap between critical and commercial acclaim, as well as winning a Pulitzer and selling millions of copies.<br \/>\n11. White Teeth (2000) &#8211; Zadie Smith<br \/>\nWon the Whitbread and Guardian first book awards. Set in London, is chockablock with vivid scenes and characters, a portrait of postcolonial multicultural London. Her continuing work includes two other novels named by critics in the BBC Culture poll \u2013 NW, which ranked at number 18, and On Beauty.<br \/>\n10. Half of a Yellow Sun (2006) &#8211; Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,<br \/>\nA serious political novel about love in wartime, the Biafra conflict traumatised her country and her family for three years after the Igbo people of eastern Nigeria seceded in 1967. Adichie\u2019s 2013 novel Americanah also ranked high in the poll, but missed out on a spot in the top 12 by one vote.<br \/>\n9. *Atonement (2001) &#8211; Ian McEwan<br \/>\nMcEwan\u2019s haunting and beautifully crafted novel opens with Briony witnesses her 15-year-old cousin Lola being assaulted in the darkened woods. Her testimony implicates Robbie, her sister Cecilia\u2019s boyfriend and he is jailed. In a second section, McEwan gives a panoramic account of the harrowing evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940, with Robbie among those saved. Briony works as a nurse during the Blitz in a third section. As McEwan follows these characters through six decades, Briony\u2019s search for redemption evolves into a meditation on the power of art.<br \/>\n8. *Billy Lynn\u2019s Long Halftime Walk (2012) &#8211; Ben Fountain<br \/>\nWinner of a National Book Critics Circle award, is about eight rookies from the US army\u2019s Bravo squad, fresh from a firefight with Iraqi insurgents. Dubbed war heroes by the Fox News cable channel, their two-week stateside victory tour ends with a halftime salute at a Dallas Cowboys game. Fountain captures the excesses of Texas, American football, business and war.<br \/>\n7. *A Visit from the Goon Squad (2010) &#8211; Jennifer Egan,<br \/>\nWon the National Book Critics Circle and Pulitzer awards. A narrative around a punk rocker-turned-music producer, his sticky-fingered assistant and a circle of wannabes, has-beens and hangers-on. Juxtaposes timeless literary themes, most notably the inexorable journey from youth to age, with an exploration of the ways in which a rapidly changing world reshapes the human experience.<br \/>\n6. *The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay (2000) &#8211; Michael Chabon,<br \/>\nPulitzer Prize winner. Joe Kavalier, a Houdini-like escape artist, smuggles himself out of Nazi-occupied Prague in 1939 and ends up in New York City. With his Brooklyn cousin Sammy Clay he invents a superhero character called the Escapist and launches the golden age of comic books.<br \/>\n5. *The Corrections (2001) &#8211; Jonathan Franzen,<br \/>\nWinner of a US National Book Award, this big, sprawling, fat, edgy multigenerational family saga touches on some of the most important themes of the early years of this millennium \u2013 economic uncertainty, the conflicts between parents and their drifting middle-aged children and the enormous issues of an aging society past its prime. He does it with great storytelling and a lot of humour.<br \/>\n4. Gilead (2004) &#8211; Marilynne Robinson,<br \/>\nThe Rev John Ames, a small-town Iowa minister, describes his life and anti-slavery heritage to his young son in dazzling lyrical language in this first installment of Robinson\u2019s trilogy (along with Home and Lila). Few living novelists write more seriously and profoundly about religious faith.<br \/>\n3. *Wolf Hall (2009) &#8211; Hilary Mantel<br \/>\nWon the Man Booker and National Book Critics Circle awards, was adapted to the stage and has been filmed as a new BBC miniseries. Told from the perspective of Thomas Cromwell (with Henry VIII as a supporting character), it brilliantly retells an oft-told tale. Mantel&#8217;s flawless examination of power completely catapults the reader into the character\u2019s mind. Mantel\u2019s sequel, Bring in the Bodies, also gathered votes.<br \/>\n2. *The Known World (2003) &#8211; Edward P Jones,<br \/>\nSet in 1855 on the plantation of Henry Townsend \u2013 born a slave, now a slave-owner \u2013 this is a triumph of empathy, immersing readers in a complex moral time without making simple judgments. Facing an early death, Townsend ponders the future of his 50-acre Virginia plantation and the slaves he treats the way his former owner, now his mentor, taught him. This may be the best American novel published in the 21st Century \u2013 a stunning work about humans experiencing and surviving American slavery &#8211; an epic, complex, unflinching and engrossing view of America&#8217;s messy history.<br \/>\n1. *The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao (2007) &#8211; Junot D\u00edaz,<br \/>\nWinner in this BBC Culture critics\u2019 poll and the Pulitzer Prize in fiction.

All the time we spend in airports and on planes, buses, and trains make for the perfect situation to pick up a good book and get lost. There\u2019s nothing better than reading a book set in a destination I\u2019ve been or dream of going. There are a lot of great books out there that are great for travelers, so we talked amongst ourselves here at BootsnAll and asked our community for suggestions. We were overwhelmed with awesome suggestions, many of which we hadn\u2019t heard of before. So we put together this list of top travel books:<br \/>\n1. *Vagabonding: An Uncommon Guide to the Art of Long-Term World Travel &#8211; Rolf Potts: This book inspired a whole new generation of backpackers and long-term indie travelers by the Voice of Generation X and Y traveler, Rolf Potts. Most of the content is not \u201chow to\u201d \u2013 which is commonplace on the web today, but philosophical and helps would be AND experienced travelers with the stuff that goes on in your head. CEO and Co-founder of BootsnAll said this about the book Vagabonding, \u201cIf there is one book on this list to read, read this one.

Even if you\u2019re a mid-range traveler, you can find a lot of value in Tim Leffel\u2019s boo<br \/>\n4. Take Me With You &#8211; Brad Newsham: Long-time friend of BootsnAll, Brad Newsham wrote this book over 10 years ago now. It\u2019s an epic story, of Brad\u2019s mission to bring someone back from his travels, something many folks feel after doing some intensive indie travel. Brad wears his heart on his sleeve in everything he does, and this book is no different. Enjoy.<br \/>\n5. The Last Lecture &#8211; Randy Pausch<br \/>\n6. The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People &#8211; Stephen R. Covey<br \/>\n7. Around the Bloc: My Life in Moscow, Beijing, and Havana &#8211; Stephanie Elizondo Griest<br \/>\n8. The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom &#8211; Jonathan Haidt: If you know you\u2019ve wanted to travel, but you can\u2019t seem to make it happen, then maybe your rider and your elephant are not aligned. The author motivates this simple rider-elephant metaphor in 10 powerful chapters in which he supports ancient wisdom with the latest scientific research to help us understand what happiness is and how we can get it. And, it\u2019s not by sitting around meditating.<br \/>\n9.

If you\u2019ve ever wondered what traveling and living in India is like, the country is highlighted as a main character in the book, loosely based on the author\u2019s life. This is the first book that made me excited, instead of scared, to visit India.<br \/>\n14. The Beach &#8211; Alex Garland<br \/>\n15. *The Alchemist &#8211; Paulo Coelho: It gave me the motivation and inspiration to DREAM that I could keep going and growing, and the knowledge that my dreams (of travelling) WOULD come true if I want them badly enough \u2013 Edric Hsu<br \/>\n16. The Pilgrimage &#8211; Paulo Coelho: \u201cThe Pilgrimage details Paulo Coelho\u2019s journey along the legendary road of San Tiago across Spain. In The Pilgrimage, Coelho recounts the spectacular trials that lead him to discover personal power, wisdom, and a miraculous sword that seals his initiation into the secret society of the Tradition. With his enigmatic mentor, Petrus, he follows a legendary road travelled by pilgrims of San Tiago since the Middle Ages, encountering a Chaucerian variety of mysterious guides and devilish opponents. Coelho\u2019s experiences and his mentor\u2019s teachings impart the spiritual wisdom that reveals itself as the true purpose of their exciting journey.\u201d \u2013 Review by Maverick Book Review<br \/>\n17. *Into the Wild &#8211; John Krakauer<br \/>\n18. *Into Thin Air &#8211; John Krakauer<br \/>\n19.

They became attached to each other, and Kerasote decided to name the dog Merle and bring him home. There, he realized that Merle\u2019s native intelligence would be diminished by living exclusively in the human world. He put a dog door in his house so Merle could live both outside and in. A deeply touching portrait of a remarkable dog and his relationship with the author, Merle\u2019s Door explores the issues that all animals and their human companions face as their lives intertwine, bringing to bear the latest research into animal consciousness and behavior as well as insights into the origins and evolution of the human-dog partnership. Merle showed Kerasote how dogs might live if they were allowed to make more of their own decisions, and Kerasote suggests how these lessons can be applied universally.&#8221; &#8211; Synopsis from Good Reads<br \/>\n24. *The Road &#8211; Cormac McCarthy<br \/>\n25. On the Island &#8211; Tracey Garvis Graves<br \/>\n26.

Maarten Troost: Your plane\/bus\/train mates may look at you funny when reading J. Maarten Troost&#8217;s debut novel.

Lost on Planet China: One Man&#8217;s Attempt to Understand the World&#8217;s Most Mystifying Nation &#8211; J. Maarten Troost: I&#8217;m not sure if this made me more intrigued to visit China or scared me away, but I do know that Troost&#8217;s third travel book entertained me and had me laughing just as hard as his first two. While laughs are a great part of Troost&#8217;s books, they are also very informative and offer great insights into the countries he visits and lives in.<br \/>\n30. *A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail &#8211; Bill Bryson: This was my introduction to Bryson, and I have come back to it a few times since the first read.

The Open Road: The Global Journey of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama &#8211; Pico Iyer: &#8220;In \u201cThe Open Road,\u201d Iyer takes a long, hard look at the many meanings of this deceptively simple man. At first blush, one might wonder why Iyer, best known as the author of many travel memoirs including \u201cVideo Night in Kathmandu\u201d and \u201cSun After Dark,\u201d would take on such a subject. The answer lies in the understanding that Iyer is not just a travel writer, and the Dalai Lama is not just a monk.&#8221; &#8211; Holly Morris, New York Times<br \/>\n73.

Have Mother, Will Travel: A Mother and Daughter Discover Themselves, Each Other, and the World &#8211; Claire Fontaine<br \/>\n83. The Golden Bough &#8211; Sir James G. Frazer: It&#8217;s a cross cultural survey of traditional rituals, taboos, sacrifices, myths, and superstitions &#8212; from Europe to Asia, from American Indians to African tribes. Often in our travels we notice that seemingly very different cultures may have similar practices &#8211; We find totem poles in Vancouver, and yet we find similar totemic practices in southern China and even in Hungary. We often wonder how this could be possible, and Frazer&#8217;s book tells us why. For the cultural traveler it&#8217;s an incredible book of insights and an invaluable tool to help us get the most out of our travels. &#8211; Bruce<br \/>\n84.

Mongolia: Travels in the Untamed Land &#8211; Jasper Becker: &#8220;For seventy years Mongolia was all but closed to the west &#8211; a forbidden country, shrouded in darkness. Jasper Becker had long dreamed of exploring the sweeping land that lay just beyond China\u2019s Great Wall and when communism disintegrated, he finally did. Setting out from Kublai Khan\u2019s capital, Beijing, Becker was one of the first westerners to cross the border. Tracing the course of the Yellow River, he ventured deep into the heart of Mongolia, witnessing the birth of one of the world\u2019s youngest democracies as well as the deep and tragic impact of the rules of Mao and Stalin on the Mongolian people.&#8221; -Synopsis from Good Reads<br \/>\n87. Genghis Khan: Life, Death, and Resurrection- John Man: &#8220;John Man&#8217;s absorbing and beautifully written book investigates a vast amount of evidence, much of it partial, much of it conflicting and much of it mysterious, to produce a thrilling account of Genghis&#8217;s life, death and his continuing influence.&#8221;<br \/>\n88. Empire of the Soul: Some Journeys in India &#8211; Paul William Roberts: &#8220;One of the finest travel writers has taken on the most impenetrable country, describing his spiritual pilgrimages of the &#8217;70s and return visits of the &#8217;90s. Paul William Roberts says &#8220;[India] is the only country that feels like home to me, the only country whose airport tarmac I have ever kissed upon landing.&#8221; But no sentimentality dulls Roberts&#8217;s keen eye as he visits ashrams, junkie dens, and Mother Teresa&#8217;s order, explaining the complex history of castes and colonialization as he goes. He ferrets out beauty and hypocrisy with an insightful take on the masses of humanity that travel and live there.&#8221;<br \/>\n89.

In Ethiopia with a Mule &#8211; Dervla Murphy<br \/>\n92. Where the Indus is Young: A Winter in Baltistan &#8211; Dervla Murphy: &#8220;One winter, Dervla Murphy and her six-year-old daughter Rachel walked into the Karakoram mountains in the frozen heart of the Western Himalayas and along the perilous Indus Gorge. Accompanied only by a gallant polo pony, they encountered conditions that tested the limits of their ingenuity, endurance, and courage. Hair-raising, gloriously subjective, and with the quirky vitality of fiction, the resulting book is a classic of travel writing.&#8221;<br \/>\n93.

How to Walk a Puma: And Other Things I Learned While Stumbling through South America<br \/>\n&#8211; Peter Allison: &#8220;Ever the gifted storyteller and cultural observer, Allison makes many observations about life in humid climes, the nature of nomadism, and exactly what it is like to be nearly blasted off a mountain by the famous Patagonia wind. Allison\u2019s self-deprecating humor is as delightful as his crazy stunts, and his love for animals\u2014even when they bite\u2014is infectious.&#8221; &#8211; Synopsis from Good Reads<br \/>\n97.
