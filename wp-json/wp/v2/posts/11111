In the NM XL series, this reserve is 1,611 sq. km and the largest protected area in Bulgaria, and the largest oak forest on the continent. 80% is forested \u2013 30% of which is old-growth forest with some trees 500 years old with 1.5-2m diameter trunks. The maximum altitude is on Ghadishle Peak (710m). It has huge biodiversity but bears and Eurasian lynx have been extinct here for many decades. It is the 2<sup>nd<\/sup> largest bird migration area in Europe. There are 21 settlements in the park with a total population of 6,200 and 425 monuments of culture including fire dancing.<br \/>\nGoogle Maps took me to an area in the geographic centre of the park &#8211; a very well-treed rural area with no visible towns. You couldn\u2019t drive a very tall vehicle as the trees were so overhanging. The road was more potholes and broken pavement than the real road. So I returned 11 km to take another road to Burgas on the Black Sea coast hoping for a better road (it was). It was not necessary to drive to where I did as the main road goes through the park. I passed through the town of Mayor Vishnyaev with incredibly decrepit apartment buildings.<br \/>\n<strong>Brashlyan<\/strong> (pop 50). In the NM \u201csmall town\u201d series, the name is translated as \u2018Ivy\u2019.

It is the only inhabited island off the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast.<br \/>\nThe island is supplied with electricity and drinking water. It is named after the former St. Anastasia convent located on it. The convent had existed since the Middle Ages and was reconstructed during the 18th-19th century. It has been abandoned since 1923, when the island was transformed into a prison.<br \/>\nIn 1925, a group of 43 political prisoners (communists and anti-fascists), led by Teohar Bakardzhiev, revolted and escaped from the island, subsequently fleeing to the Soviet Union. In their honour, the island was renamed Bolshevik Island when the communists came into power in 1945.<br \/>\nDesires to privatize the island in 2006 were objected to by the\u00a0Bulgarian Orthodox Church\u00a0which claims the island is its property.<br \/>\nToday, in addition to the monastery with its church, there is a lighthouse situated on the island, as well as a museum, a restaurant, a small quay, a conference hall and two guesthouses with a total of five rooms available to tourists. In the summer, the island is accessible from Burgas via boat services running back and forth multiple times a day.<br \/>\nNo boats were running in April when I was in the area.

Often referred to as the &#8220;<i>Pearl of the Black Sea<\/i>&#8220;, Nesebar is a rich city museum defined by more than three millennia of ever-changing history. The small city exists in two parts separated by a narrow man-made isthmus with the ancient part of the settlement on the peninsula (previously an island), and the more modern section (i.e. hotels, later development) on the mainland side. The older part bears evidence of occupation by a variety of different civilizations over the course of its existence.<br \/>\nIt is one of the most prominent tourist destinations and seaports on the Black Sea, in what has become a popular area with several large resorts\u2014the largest, Sunny Beach, is situated immediately to the north of Nessebar.<br \/>\nNesebar has on several occasions found itself on the frontier of a threatened empire, and as such it is a town with a rich history.

It remained the only Dorian colony along the Black Sea coast, as the rest were typical Ionian colonies. In 425-424 BC, the town joined the Delian League, under the leadership of Athens. <sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>Remains date mostly from the Hellenistic period and include the acropolis, a temple of Apollo and an agora. A wall that formed part of the Thracian fortifications can still be seen on the north side of the peninsula.

During the time of the Second Bulgarian Empire, it was also contested by Bulgarian and Byzantine forces and enjoyed particular prosperity under Bulgarian tsar Ivan Alexander (1331\u20131371) until it was conquered by Crusaders led by Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy in 1366. The Bulgarian version of the name, <i>Nesebar<\/i> or <i>Mesebar<\/i>, has been attested since the 11th century.<br \/>\nMonuments from the Middle Ages include the 5\u20136th century <i>Stara Mitropoliya<\/i> (&#8220;old bishopric&#8221;; also St Sophia), a basilica without a transept; the 6th-century church of the Virgin; and the 11th century <i>Nova Mitropoliya<\/i> (&#8220;new bishopric&#8221;; also St Stephen) which continued to be embellished until the 18th century.

Inhabited since the 2<sup>nd<\/sup> millennium BC when it was controlled by the legendary Thracian leader Melia, it was inhabited by the Greeks, Romans, Byzantines and Ottomans. Little older than the 17<sup>th<\/sup> century remains \u2013 some fortified walls at the entrance and a few remnants of the wall; the rough stone streets might be the most authentic. Most of the old stuff consists of 2 story homes with stone first floors and plank second floors, all renovated and occupied; some of the planks are restored, others unpainted.<br \/>\nNessebar is a tourist magnet and the streets are one big knick-knack, clothing and jewelry store.<br \/>\nThere are 6 churches that all charge a fee to visit (all but St Stephans are stone with brick layering, brick arches, and decorative pots in arches above the arches): Christ Pantocrator (1<sup>st<\/sup> half 11<sup>th<\/sup> century), St Pandskeva (13<sup>th<\/sup> century, used until 19<sup>th<\/sup> century), St John the Baptist (10<sup>th<\/sup> century,12 by 10m), Holy Savior (16th-century\u00a0frescoes), St Stephan (the star, modern looking but completely painted inside, great chandeliers).<br \/>\n<strong>Church of St. Sophia<\/strong> (Old Metropolitan Church). The only church listed in NM, it is also the only ruin with no roof. The original church here was from the 5<sup>th<\/sup> century, the present shell is from the 9<sup>th<\/sup> century. It is a 3-nave basilica, 19 by 13m, big brick apse, and 2 stories of 6 intact arches per side.<br \/>\n<strong>Archaeological Museum.<\/strong> These are generally a waste of time with a huge variety of pots dating to the 6<sup>th<\/sup> century BC, Roman glass, a pile of stone fragments and carved gravestones.

There is only one access (hotels and resorts block most access) and there is a short wharf extending out into the water. The area is very tacky: several casinos, strip clubs, a few shops, a McDonalds, and a Subway, but most everything else is boarded up. Many stores have paper covering the inside \u2013 maybe it is out of season. A sign on the beach says \u201cSwimming forbidden, no lifeguard\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><strong>VARNA <\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Naval Museum.<\/strong> Outside there are two torpedo boats, helicopters, torpedoes, mines and several anchors.

The accurate shot of Drazki was the first Bulgarian naval victory. Since 1957, it has been a ship museum.<br \/>\nPart of the Naval Museum, it sits high above the water and doesn\u2019t look like it gets many visits. 2 BGN<br \/>\n<strong>Varna Aquarium.<\/strong> Sitting high above the water in an incongruous 2 story building, it is dated with small tanks showcasing marine and freshwater fauna of the Black Sea. In the same building is the Institute of Fish Resources Varna. 4 BGN<br \/>\n<strong>Archaeological Museum Varna<\/strong>. In a grand stone building, has the usual prehistory through Stone Age, Bronze Age, Hellenistic and especially Roman artifacts, again the usual large number of pots. The highlight is the reconstructed dwellings. 6 BGN<br \/>\n<strong>Varna Cathedral.<\/strong> Based on a square, the walls and ceilings are covered in still-bright frescoes and acanthus leaves. There are 9 domes with the central one supported by 4 massive columns. There are intricately carved wood icon stands an altar screen and 3 nice black chandeliers. Free<br \/>\n<strong>Retro Museum.<\/strong> In the Grand Shopping Mall (third level), Google Maps was very confusing. This has an extensive display of stuff from the 60s, 70s and 1980s, with almost all East European products all attractively displayed and with digital labels in four languages including a huge number of cars that all looked alike. Some of the more interesting exhibits were politicians (Marx, Engles, Mao, Lenin, Stalin), washing machines, snow cones, toys, bicycles, motorcycles, soap, sleighs, cosmetics, clothes, cigarettes, cameras, phones, typewriters, radios and TVs. 10 BGN, 5 reduced<br \/>\n<strong>Bulgaria-Soviet Friendship Monument<\/strong>. This memorial is to Russia\u2019s support of Bulgaria during the 1828-29 Russo-Turkish War. During that conflict, the Siege of Varna had lasted for two months. After landing on the coast north of the city, Russian forces established their camp on a nearby hill named Turna Tepe, as they battled the Ottoman forces who held the city.<br \/>\nConstruction of the monument commenced in late 1974, and 27,000 volunteer workers toiled for four years to create the structure and the 400 square metre platform on which it stands. More than 10,000 tonnes of concrete and 1,000 tonnes of armature iron were used to create the monument. A large bronze cube was constructed in front of the structure, burning with an eternal flame fed by pipes hidden in the concrete platform beneath. A total of 180 floodlights were positioned to illuminate the monument at night so that it would be visible even by ships far out in the Black Sea.<br \/>\nThe monument fell into disuse after the political changes of 1989. Today, it is heavily vandalized and has been stripped bare, leaving little more than graffitied concrete and rebar.<br \/>\nThe Monument to the Bulgarian-Soviet Friendship represents a gesture of comradeship between two countries, and it was designed to resemble a bird of peace facing out across the sea towards the USSR (at least, in symbolic terms; in reality it is angled more towards Ankara in Turkey). The figures at the front of the monument show four Russian soldiers, on the right, coming to the rescue of three Bulgarian women on the left. The women hold gifts of bread and salt, as well as Bulgaria&#8217;s national flower, the rose. These seven statues positioned on the wings measure 11m in height. Metal letters on the front of the Monument to the Bulgarian-Soviet Friendship, now heavily decayed and partially missing, once read: \u201cFriendship for centuries throughout centuries.\u201d The 15-metre wide \u2018Staircase of Victors\u2019 includes a total of 305 steps up to the monument itself, and in the surrounding park more than 20,000 decorative trees were planted to represent fallen Soviet soldiers.<br \/>\nInside, it is deceptively spacious \u2013\u00a0the interior consists of numerous passages and chambers which originally served memorial and museum purposes. The largest space, inside the right-hand wing and with an indented star formed in its end wall, once contained a museum dedicated to the Russo-Turkish War. Inside the left-hand wing, a space with tiered seating served as a small hall for meetings. A monumental plaque, positioned above the entry staircase and now decayed almost beyond legibility, featured a quote from Georgi Dimitrov, Bulgaria\u2019s first communist leader: \u201cFriendship with the Soviet Union is as essential as is the sun, air and water for the living creature.\u201d<br \/>\nA series of chambers on the ground floor of the Monument to the Bulgarian-Soviet Friendship contained a bookshop and library, while a wide staircase beneath the structure leads down into the hill itself. A large bomb shelter, now abandoned, was constructed inside the base of the hill.<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"http:\/\/www.monumentalism.net\/varna-bulgarian-soviet-friendship\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwimxKDDwfnhAhWK5KQKHcxcAyYQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"http:\/\/www.monumentalism.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/BG-Varna-Bulgarian-Soviet-Friendship.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Bulgaria-Soviet Friendship Monument\u00a0\" width=\"597\" height=\"398\" data-iml=\"1556685535749\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Evxinograd.<\/strong> 8 km east of Varna on 90 hectares, this was initially a summer residence for the first Bulgarian Prince Alexander Battenberg.

To visit Bilchek Palace, you must pass through the University Botanical Gardens. Each is a separate ticket sold at different ticket counters close together.<br \/>\n<strong>Balchik Botanical Garden<\/strong> (University Botanical Gardens Balchik). This garden was quite spectacular with two large flowerbeds, all in active bloom: tulips, geraniums, iris, forget-me-nots and several others. The greenhouse is full of succulents and cacti with hundreds (thousands?) of varieties. Many are in tiny pots with 100 to a display case. Outside there is a large group of more cactus, some of it very woody. There are also some nice water features. All labels are by scientific name. 8 BGN, 3 reduced<br \/>\n<strong>Balchik Palace.<\/strong> This small residence was built in 1931 for Romanian royalty.

The house itself has a lovely 2<sup>nd<\/sup> floor but most of the rooms are small and uninteresting. There is some furniture and a small art show was exhibited. It is all kind of confusing.<br \/>\nThe gardens were not so spectacular (they are not botanical gardens but simply the grounds of the palace) &#8211; most were roses not yet in bloom in beds lining the wall separating the grounds from the beach. There were some small flowerbeds. The water features were quite nice, with a waterfall, a water cascade down a high rock wall and several small fountains. Don\u2019t continue past the chapel (tiny but with nice frescoes covering all the walls and ceiling) as there is no exit this way and you have to climb back up past the wall cascade. 6 BGN, no reduction<\/p>\n<p><strong>Kaliakra Lighthouse.<\/strong> It was a 33km drive under chalk cliffs from Balchik out to the end of the Kaliakra peninsula.

The Romans took over in the 1<sup>st<\/sup> century and called it Acros Castellion (\u201cfortified cape\u201d). A Roman bath and many of the building foundations date from then. In the 7<sup>th<\/sup> century, it reached its zenith as a Bulgarian port and commercial town that ended with the Ottomans in the 14<sup>th<\/sup> century. The successful 1791 naval battle between the Russian Black Sea fleet and the Ottomans is the subject of a large memorial and bas-relief on a cliff.
