Strengthened by the Spanish in the 1640s, it was captured by the French in 1692, and then redesigned as a textbook fortress by Louis XIV\u2019s renowned military engineer Vauban. Razed and rebuilt again thereafter, by WWI it was considered impregnable, yet it fell to the Germans in 3 days. In WWII Namur was bombed heavily causing extensive damage. The citadel was in military use until 1972.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Citadel de Namur.<\/strong> It covers the entr\u00e9e hilltop with ramparts, tunnels, and grey walls.

The abbey is well known for its history and spiritual life but also its local production of the Trappist beer Orval and a specific cheese.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>History.<\/strong> The site has been occupied since the\u00a0Merovingian\u00a0period, and there is evidence that there was already a chapel here in the 10th century. In 1070, a group of Benedictine monks from Calabria\u00a0settled here, at the invitation of Arnould, Count of\u00a0Chiny, and began construction of a church and a monastery, but after some forty years, possibly because of the death of Count Arnould, they moved away again. They were replaced by a community of\u00a0Canons Regular, who completed the construction work: the abbey church was consecrated on 30 September 1124. In 1132, a group of Cistercian monks from\u00a0Trois-Fontaines Abbey\u00a0in\u00a0Champagne\u00a0arrived, and the two groups formed a single community within the\u00a0Cistercian Order. Around 1252, the monastery was destroyed by a fire; the rebuilding took around 100 years.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">During the 15th and 16th centuries, the various wars between France and various neighbouring regions had an important impact on Orval. At one stage a foundry was established on the site. In 1637, during the Thirty Years&#8217; War, the abbey was pillaged and burnt by French mercenaries.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In the 17th century, the abbey converted to the\u00a0Trappist\u00a0branch of the Cistercian order but reverted to the Rule of the main order in around 1785. In 1793, during the\u00a0French Revolution, the abbey was completely burnt down by French forces, in retaliation for the hospitality it had provided to\u00a0Austrian\u00a0troops, and the community dispersed.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In 1887, the land and ruins were acquired by the Harenne family. They donated the lands to the Cistercian order in 1926 so that monastic life could resume on the site. Between 1926 and 1948, under the direction of the Trappist monk Marie-Albert van der Cruyssen, the new monastery was constructed, and in 1935 Orval regained the rank of the abbey with the new church was consecrated in 1948.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Retreat at the Abbey.<\/strong> To achieve renewal through personal and communal prayer and to withdraw for a spiritual halt, the monks at Ovral provide a guest house for individuals or groups for 2-7 days.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Trappist Brewery.<\/strong> Established in 1931 to finance the reconstruction of Ovral, it is very popular.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Trappist Dairy.<\/strong> Using an 1816 recipe, this has produced a creamy cheese that matured for 3 weeks with a naturally washed crust since 1928.
