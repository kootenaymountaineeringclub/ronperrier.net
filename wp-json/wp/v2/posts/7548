The Idaho Peak road is on a shady, northeast slope. It remains impassably snowbound well into summer. To get to the lookout before then and now with no road, you have to do it the hard way, up the sunny SW face of Selkirk Peak. To add to this the Idaho Peak road has been washed out since 2018, so the Wakefield Trail is now the only reasonable way to Idaho.<br \/>\nAs it is south-facing, it is one of the earliest trails to become snow-free. Switchbacking up from the Wakefield Mine site in Silverton Creek to the Idaho Peak parking lot, one is walking in the footsteps of the old miners who used this pack trail to get to their mines on Silver Ridge. A sharp eye will find old shoes, tools, bottles and other remnants from miners who toiled their way up and down this trail in search of fortunes.<br \/>\nBeware crossing the avalanche chutes as they can have very hard-packed snow and be dangerous to cross. An ice axe would make it some safer small instep crampons would be reassuring.<br \/>\nIdaho Peak offers the best view in the West Kootenay &#8211; 360 degrees of wilderness. Views are almost 6,000 feet down to Slocan Lake, the villages of New Denver and Silverton and the remains of mine workings from years ago. In the distance, there are excellent views of the Slocan, Goat, Kokanee, and Valhalla mountain ranges.\u00a0<\/em><em>The summer wildflower display is world-renowned.

They often freeze overnight and present very dangerous crossings. If good boot steps can&#8217;t be kicked in, the only safe way to cross is with crampons (in-step probably satisfactory) and an ice-axe. Old mine tailings and ruins of mine buildings are passed as the trail winds its way steeply upwards.
