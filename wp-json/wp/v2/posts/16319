Brazilian buses are quite unlike Canadian Greyhound buses as they have almost completely reclining and comfortable seats. It is necessary to have a blanket or sleeping bag as the air conditioning makes them uncomfortably cold. I also have a pillowcase I stuff with my down jacket. Most have USB plugs to keep electronics charged. Except at night with no view, it is lovely to sit, read, nap, read, nap&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. The view on almost every bus has been virtually identical &#8211; flat and either in the Amazon rainforest or on its fringes. In the south, deforestation is marked with agriculture as the main economy. The fields are either pasture with cattle or especially around Sinop fields of soybeans or peas.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>After looking at the map, I realized that Goias was about 2 hours before Goiania so I asked the bus driver if he could drop me off. Goias is not a usual bus stop. I was left off on the highway, saw the neighbourhood of Goias Velho, and went down a street in that direction. It was very uninspiring so I stopped at what I thought was a municipal building and asked if I could talk to someone. My TIM data was not available for some reason (it turned out to be one company with no service in Goias). The building was the courthouse, but a lovely young guy who spoke good English came down and gave me a tourist tour of the town, telling me where the Historic Center was, the church, the bus depot, and suggestions for hotels and restaurants. I used his wife to mark everything in and walked a sweaty 20 minutes down to the Historic Centre, stopping off at Pousada Vovo Du Hotel (50 BR, fan only, a perfectly adequate place). It then proceeded to rain torrentially. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Historic Centre of the Town of Goi\u00e1s WHS<br \/>\n<\/strong>Goi\u00e1s testifies to the occupation and colonization of the lands of central Brazil in the 18th and 19th centuries. Although modest, both public and private architecture form a harmonious whole, thanks to the coherent use of local materials and vernacular techniques.<br \/>\nThe Historic Centre of the Town of Goi\u00e1s is built between two series of hills, along a small river, the Rio Vermelho. The area on the right bank is tight up against the north-western hills and has the church of Rosario, which was traditionally reserved for slaves. The areas on the left bank, limited by the hills to the south-east, are reserved for the more representative groups of buildings, including the parish church (today the cathedral) of Santana, the Governor\u2019s Palace, the barracks, the Casa de Fundi\u00e7\u00e3o (foundry), extending to the Pra\u00e7a do Chafariz and climbing towards the hill of Chapeu do Padre. Here are also to be found the historic residential quarter and a characteristic marketplace. The urban layout is an example of the organic development of a mining town, adapted to the conditions of the site.<br \/>\nThe origins of the town of Goi\u00e1s are closely related to the history of the official expeditions (bandeiras), which left S\u00e3o Paulo to explore the interior of the Brazilian territory. It was the first officially recognized urban core, the first borough to be planned West of the demarcation line of the Treaty of Tordesillas that defined the boundaries of the Portuguese possessions.<br \/>\nIt is the last remaining example of the occupation of the interior of Brazil, as it was practiced in the 18th\u00a0and 19th\u00a0centuries. The Historic Center went through a long period of stagnation from the 19th\u00a0century until recent times. Its townscape has therefore not been subject to any major changes in modern times. It has a rich social and cultural life. The relatively modest development of tourism reinforces the genuineness and authenticity of these cultural manifestations. For that reason, the Historic Center of the Town of Goi\u00e1s is considered to have well preserved its historical authenticity.<br \/>\nThe Historic Centre is lovely with streets of the roughest, large-stone cobble, all sunken and uneven. The mostly one-story homes and businesses are freshly painted in bold pastels. The church is a huge 3-nave church with frescoes depicting indigenous people and miners and nice pink\/yellow stained glass in a geometric design. The church and Governor&#8217;s Palace surround a nice, leafy square. Cross the muddy river and Cora Coralina&#8217;s house is immediately to the left. I walked up to the other church.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/media.gttwl.com\/attachments\/global\/1396556293_large.jpeg\" alt=\"Historic Centre of the Town of Goi\u00e1s you otta go here\" width=\"534\" height=\"506\" \/><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" title=\"Historic Centre of the Town of Olinda\" src=\"https:\/\/whc.unesco.org\/uploads\/thumbs\/site_0189_0017-750-0-20131015143928.jpg\" width=\"530\" height=\"706\" data-src=\"\/uploads\/thumbs\/site_0189_0017-750-0-20131015143928.jpg\" \/><br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nCora Coralina House,<\/strong> In the NM House and Biographical Museums series, this house was originally built in the 1770s.

The region where Minas Gerais is today was inhabited by more than 100\u00a0indigenous peoples\u00a0as long ago as 11,400 to 12,000 years ago. They became targets of\u00a0enslavement, and there are currently five groups:<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Brazilian gold rush\u00a0(started 1693),\u00a0gems, and later\u00a0diamonds and enslaved African labor built the\u00a0Estrada Real, the &#8220;royal road,&#8221; that connected\u00a0Rio de Janeiro\u00a0and\u00a0Paraty\u00a0to the mineral-rich regions of\u00a0Ouro Preto, Serro, and, at the northernmost point,\u00a0Diamantina. As the gold mines were exhausted over the 19th century, Ouro Preto\u00a0remained the state capital until the construction of the all-new, planned city of\u00a0Belo Horizonte\u00a0at the turn of the 20th century. The people developed their own style of art, Barroco Mineiro, best shown in the richly decorated churches in the colonial cities.<br \/>\nDuring the 18th century, mining exploration was strongly controlled by the\u00a0Portuguese Crown, which imposed heavy taxes on everything extracted (one fifth of all gold would go to the Crown). Several rebellions including the\u00a0Inconfid\u00eancia, started in 1789 by group of middle-class colonists, but it failed and the rebels were arrested. The most famous of them, Joaquim Jos\u00e9 da Silva Xavier (known as\u00a0Tiradentes), was hanged becoming a local hero and a national martyr of Brazil.<br \/>\nMinas Gerais plays a pivotal role in shifting the economic axis from the Brazilian northeast (based on sugarcane, that starts declining in the 18th century) to the southeast of the country, which still remains the major economic center.<br \/>\n<strong>Demographics.<\/strong> In 2008, there were 19,765,000 people &#8211; White (46%), Brown\u00a0(Multiracial) (45%), Black (9%), Asian (0.2%), 37,000\u00a0Amerindian\u00a0people (0.2%). C\u00f3rrego do Bom Jesus, in the extreme south,\u00a0White people\u00a0make up 98.7%. Setubinha, in the northeast, 71.8% are\u00a0mixed-race\u00a0and 14.7%\u00a0Black.\u00a0Southern Minas Gerais, had larger numbers of\u00a0Portuguese\u00a0farmers in colonial times. In the late 19th century,\u00a0Italian\u00a0immigrants also arrived. The north region, close to\u00a0Bahia, was a place to the arrival of many\u00a0African slaves\u00a0since the 18th century. The central part of the state, where the capital\u00a0Belo Horizonte\u00a0is, has a more balanced ratio between White, Black and mixed people.<br \/>\n<strong>Religion.<\/strong>\u00a0Catholic Church\u00a0(70.4%),\u00a0Protestantism\u00a0(20.2%)<br \/>\n<strong>Economy.<\/strong> Minas Gerais is the second-largest consumer market, behind S\u00e3o Paulo &#8211; service sector 47.1%, industrial 44.1%.\u00a0agriculture 8.8%.

It is located at the top of the\u00a0Brazilian highlands\u00a0in the country&#8217;s\u00a0Central-West\u00a0region. It was founded by President\u00a0Juscelino Kubitschek\u00a0on 21 April 1960, to serve as the new national capital. Bras\u00edlia is estimated to be Brazil&#8217;s\u00a0third-most populous city.\u00a0Among major\u00a0Latin American\u00a0cities, it has the highest\u00a0GDP\u00a0per capita.<br \/>\nBras\u00edlia was a\u00a0planned city\u00a0developed by\u00a0L\u00facio Costa,\u00a0Oscar Niemeyer\u00a0and\u00a0Joaquim Cardozo\u00a0in 1956 in a scheme to move the capital from\u00a0Rio de Janeiro\u00a0to a more central location.\u00a0The city&#8217;s design divides it into numbered blocks as well as sectors for specified activities, such as the Hotel Sector, the Banking Sector, and the Embassy Sector. Bras\u00edlia was inscribed as a UNESCO\u00a0World Heritage Site\u00a0in 1987 due to its\u00a0modernist architecture\u00a0and uniquely artistic\u00a0urban planning.<br \/>\nAll three branches of Brazil&#8217;s federal government are centred in the city: executive, legislative, and judiciary. Bras\u00edlia also hosts 124 foreign embassies. The city&#8217;s international airport connects it to all other major Brazilian cities and some international destinations, and it is the third-busiest airport in Brazil.<br \/>\n<strong>History.<\/strong> Brazil&#8217;s first capital was Salvador; in 1763 Rio de Janeiro became Brazil&#8217;s capital until 1960. During this period, resources tended to be centred in Brazil&#8217;s southeastern region, and most of the country&#8217;s population was concentrated near its Atlantic coast. Brasilia&#8217;s geographically central location fostered a more regionally neutral federal capital.<br \/>\nThe Monumental Axis was assigned political and administrative activities and is considered the body of the city with the style and simplicity of its buildings, oversized scales, and broad vistas and heights. This axis includes the various ministries, national congress, presidential palace, supreme court building, and the television and radio tower.<br \/>\nThe Residential Axis was intended to contain areas with intimate character and is considered the most important achievement of the plan; it was designed for housing and associated functions such as local commerce, schooling, recreation and churches, constituted of 96 superblocks limited to six stories buildings and 12 additional superblocks limited to three stories buildings; Costa&#8217;s intention with superblocks was to have small self-contained and self-sufficient neighborhoods and uniform buildings with apartments of two or three different categories, where he envisioned the integration of upper and middle classes sharing the same residential area. But at that time he did not foresee the growing population in the city. The capacity limit in his plan later caused the formation of many favelas, poorer, more densely populated satellite cities around Brasilia, peopled by migrants from other places in the country.<br \/>\nHe also designed housing for the working classes that was separated from the upper- and middle-class housing and was visually different, to avoid slums (favelas) in the urban periphery.<br \/>\nOne of the main objectives of the plan was to allow the free flow of automobile traffic, the plan included lanes of traffic in a north-south direction (seven for each direction) for the Monumental Axis and three arterials (the W3, the Eixo and the L2) for the residential Axis; the cul-de-sac access roads of the superblocks were planned to be the end of the main flow of traffic. The emphasis on automobiles caused the lengthening of distances between centers and it attended only the necessities of a small segment of the population who owned cars. But one can not ignore the bus transportation system in the city. The buses routes inside the city operate heavily on W3 and L2. Almost anywhere, including satellite cities, can be reached just by taking the bus and most of the Plano Piloto can be reached without transferring to other buses.<br \/>\nLater when\u00a0overpopulation\u00a0turned Brasilia into a\u00a0dystopia, the transportation system also played an important role in mediating the relationship between the Pilot plan and the satellite cities. Because of overpopulation, the monument axis now has to have traffic lights on it, which violates the concept of modernity and advancement the architect first employed. Additionally, the metro system in Brasilia was mainly built for inhabitants of satellite cities. Though the overpopulation has made Brasilia no longer a pure utopia with incomparable modernity, the later development of traffic lights, buses routes to satellite cities, and the metro system all served as a remedy to the dystopia.<br \/>\nParano\u00e1 Lake, a large artificial lake, was built to increase the amount of water available and to maintain the region&#8217;s humidity. It has a marina and hosts wakeboarders and windsurfers. Diving can also be practiced and one of the main attractions is Vila Amaury, an old village submerged in the lake.<br \/>\n<strong>Climate. <\/strong>Brasilia has a\u00a0tropical savanna climate\u00a0milder due to the elevation and with two distinct seasons: the\u00a0rainy season, from October to April, and the\u00a0dry season, from May to September. Average temperatures from September through March are a consistent 22\u00a0\u00b0.\u00a0With 241.5\u00a0mm (9.5\u00a0in), December is the month with the highest rainfall of the year, while June is the lowest, with only 4.9\u00a0mm (0.2\u00a0in). During the dry season, the city can have very low\u00a0relative humidity\u00a0levels, often below 30%.<br \/>\n<strong>Demographics.<\/strong>\u00a0(Multiracial) (48.2%), 1,084,418\u00a0White\u00a0(42.2%), 198,072\u00a0Black\u00a0(7.7%), 41,522\u00a0Asian\u00a0(1.6%), and 6,128\u00a0Amerindian\u00a0(0.2%).<br \/>\nIn the city of Brasilia proper, the plano piloto was planned for about 500,000 inhabitants, a figure the plano piloto never surpassed, with a current population of only 214,529. From the beginning, the growth of Brasilia was greater than the original estimates. According to the original plans, Brasilia would be a city for government authorities and staff. However, during its construction, Brazilians from all over the country migrated to the satellite cities of Brasilia, seeking public and private employment.<br \/>\n<strong>Economy.<\/strong> Public Administration 54.8%, Services 28.7%, Industry 10.2%, Commerce 6.1%, Agrobusiness 0.2%.<br \/>\nBrasilia ranks 45th among the most expensive cities in the world in 2012, up from the 70th position in 2010, ranking behind S\u00e3o Paulo (12th) and Rio de Janeiro (13th).<br \/>\nThe Federal District has the largest\u00a0GDP per capita\u00a0income of Brazil US$25,062, slightly higher than Belarus.<br \/>\n<strong>Architecture and urbanism. <\/strong>Even these positive features have sparked controversy, expressed in the nickname &#8220;ilha da fantasia&#8221; (&#8220;fantasy island&#8221;), indicating the sharp contrast between the city and surrounding regions, marked by poverty and disorganization in the cities of the states of\u00a0Goi\u00e1s\u00a0and\u00a0Minas Gerais, around Brasilia.<br \/>\nCritics of Brasilia&#8217;s grand scale have characterized it as a modernist Bauhaus platonic fantasy about the future: Nothing dates faster than people&#8217;s fantasies about the future. This is what you get when perfectly decent, intelligent, and talented men start thinking in terms of space rather than place; and single rather than multiple meanings. It&#8217;s what you get when you design for political aspirations rather than real human needs. You get miles of jerry-built platonic nowhere infested with Volkswagens. This, one may fervently hope, is the last experiment of its kind. The utopian buck stops here. \u2014\u2009Robert Hughes, The Shock of the New.<br \/>\nThe Cathedral of Brasilia by Oscar Niemeyer is a concrete-framed hyperboloid structure, with its glass roof reaching up, open, to the heavens.

The metro leaves the Rodovi\u00e1ria (bus station) and goes south, avoiding most of the political and tourist areas. The main purpose of the metro is to serve cities, such as\u00a0Samambaia,\u00a0Taguatinga\u00a0and\u00a0Ceil\u00e2ndia, as well as Guar\u00e1 and \u00c1guas Claras.<br \/>\n<em>Buses.<\/em> The main bus hub in Brasilia is the Central Bus Station, located in the crossing of the\u00a0Eixo Monumental\u00a0and the Eix\u00e3o, about 2\u00a0km (1.2\u00a0mi) from the\u00a0Three Powers Plaza. The original plan was to have a bus station as near as possible to every corner of Brasilia. Today, the bus station is the hub of urban buses only, some running within Brasilia and others connecting Brasilia to the satellite cities.<br \/>\nIn the original city plan, the interstate buses would also stop at the Central Station. Because of the growth of Brasilia (and corresponding growth in the bus fleet), today the interstate buses leave from the older interstate station (called Rodoferrovi\u00e1ria) located at the western end of the Eixo Monumental. The Central Bus Station also contains a main metro station. A new bus station was opened in July 2010. It is on Sa\u00edda Sul (South Exit) near Park Shopping Mall with its metro station, and is also an inter-state bus station, used only to leave the Federal District.<br \/>\n<em>Rail.<\/em> There is no passenger rail service in Brasilia, but the\u00a0Expresso Pequi\u00a0rail line is planned to link Brasilia and Goi\u00e2nia.<\/p>\n<p><em>Brazilia is a big spread-out city.
