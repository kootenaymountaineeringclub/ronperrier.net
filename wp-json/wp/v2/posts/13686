When I say drifted, I say it advisedly. There were mysteries in the locomotion of that plant which could be explained on no other theory than that some mysterious current of destiny determined its movements. Houston and his friends had bought it for election purposes, and after the election was over they gave it to me. Of course, I established a newspaper.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/em><em style=\"font-size: 16px;\">That paper was the Slocan Times of New Denver, but Bogle didn\u2019t want to talk about it: \u201cIf any reader knows anything about running a newspaper in a country from which ready money has disappeared and which is gradually drying up so to speak, he will understand that the recollection is painful.\u201d<br \/>\n<\/em><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><br \/>\nIn January 1895, Bogle received a telegram from Houston asking him to ship the plant to Rossland. The <\/span><em style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Slocan Prospector<\/em><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"> described the move:\u00a0<\/span><em><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Kaslo, Feb. 2 \u2013\u00a0The perambulating press of the <\/span>Kaslo Times, Slocan Times<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">, and other times reached here today mounted on a freighter\u2019s sled and guarded by Chief Justice Bogle. It looked but little worse of wear after having made the grand circuit and was evidently but little used in the Slocan. It is now on its way to Rossland to help knock out that prosperous town.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/em><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Houston went to Rossland to start the new <\/span><em style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Miner<\/em><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"> while Bogle went to Nelson to look after the <\/span><em style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Tribune<\/em><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"> in Houston\u2019s absence. A few weeks later they switched places. Bogle elaborated on the idiosyncratic press in his 1910 memoir:\u00a0<\/span><em><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">It was a foot-power Gordon of the most antiquated make I have ever seen, and running it was heavy going but I believe that machine could have been hoisted to the top of the Union Bank building and then dropped on to Main street, and within five minutes been producing clean true printing.

First used by Father Demers for Le Courrier de la Novelle-Cal\u00e9donie. Assisted by Conte de Gueres he brought out two numbers on the old hand press. This press was also used for the Victoria Colonist when it was first brought out in 1858 &#8230; It was used on the Rosslander in 1895. Used on Prospector of Kaslo, New Denver, and Three Forks. 1864 Sentinels. Both Inland Sentinel and Cariboo Sentinel printed on the Hoe. A.B. Stanley used it. It was used for the Cowichan Leader. Lukin Johnston while editor sold the old press to weekly at Phoenix, 1912.

It agrees that it was used to print <em>Le Courrier<\/em> at Victoria in 1858 and later the Kamloops <em>Sentinel<\/em>, then was transferred to the Sisters of St. Anne\u2019s Academy in 1908 by the Sentinel\u2019s proprietor, Dr. M.S. Wade (which makes it rather unlikely it was used in Phoenix in 1912). Subsequently it was transferred to the Royal BC Museum, where I presume it remains.<\/p>\n<p>https:\/\/gregnesteroff.wixsite.com\/kutnereader\/post\/wandering-printing-presses-of-west-kootenay<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Greg Nesteroff &#8211; Kutne Reader During West Kootenay\u2019s mining boom of the 1890s, newspapers popped up like Starbucks franchises.
