A space inside had been taken over by the district government for an entirely different purpose. On one wall a vast screen showed live feeds from street cameras. With the help of artificial intelligence, it could alert officials to problems as subtle as a builder not wearing a safety-helmet or a flat being rented by too many people. They nicknamed the system that supplied this information the \u201cbig brain\u201d.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Mr Xi says city management must be \u201cas fine as embroidery\u201d. As officials put it, there must be no \u201cblind spots\u201d: every corner must be watched and any problem dealt with immediately\u2014whether an illegally parked car, a missing manhole cover or a \u201csudden incident\u201d (as the party calls everything from the truly dramatic to a gaggle of protesters complaining about unpaid wages). The big brain in Pudong district is pioneering a technological answer, collating data from sources ranging from the ubiquitous cameras to police patrols. Informants selected by the party supply information, too. One reason why Mr Xi is rebuilding the party at the grassroots is to use its members to keep watch.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Throughout the Mao era and into that of Deng Xiaoping, the party was everywhere. In the countryside, where most Chinese then lived, village party chiefs were all-powerful. In cities most people worked for state-owned companies or for government institutions, where party bosses were just as mighty. Get on the wrong side of one and it could ruin not just your career, but your entire life. The workplace was responsible for allocating housing (there were no privately owned homes). Its permission was needed to marry, travel or get a passport. When they graduated, all students had to accept whatever jobs were allocated to them by the state. A black mark from a party apparatchik could mean a dreary post in a dismal, faraway town.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">In 2002 Perry Link, an American academic, likened the party\u2019s ability to keep people in line to that of \u201ca giant anaconda coiled in an overhead chandelier\u201d. Normally the snake does not move. \u201cMore often than not, everyone in its shadow makes his or her large and small adjustments\u2014all quite \u2018naturally\u2019.\u201d As social change accelerated in the 2000s, the metaphor became less apposite. Working-age villagers moved en masse into cities where their transient lifestyles made it much harder for the party to monitor them. Housing had been privatised and far fewer people worked for the state. Students could find their own jobs and people could travel where and when they liked. The snake had become less visible and less threatening. Growing numbers of\u00a0<small>ngo<\/small>\u00a0activists, rights lawyers, citizens aggrieved by local injustices and internet users were even daring to give it a poke.<\/p>\n<h2>The party cleans up<\/h2>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Mr Xi wants to restore its visibility. Busybody party members are making a comeback. Even before he took power, experiments had begun in some cities with a new system of control called \u201cgrid management\u201d. This involved dividing communities into groups of households, or grids, and assigning people (often retirees and usually party members) to keep watch on other grid residents. Mr Xi has extended this system nationwide. The big-brain screen in Pudong shows the locations of grid monitors. When something worrisome happens, it can help officials to decide who should take a closer look.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">An official newspaper gives an example. Its journalist saw one camera home in on a piece of wastepaper on a street. That information was relayed to a grid monitor, who disposed of it. A trivial example, seemingly, but some readers may have taken note. Had the scrap been an anti-party flyer scattered by a dissident, the perpetrator could have been whisked away as quickly as the paper.<\/p>\n<div id=\"\" class=\"advert incontent  advert--inline\">\n<div>\n<div id=\"econ-2\" data-google-query-id=\"CK-K88KJuvECFXEV-QAdT6UDpg\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">At the top of the grid hierarchy sit neighbourhood party committees. These have been beefed up by putting local police chiefs in senior positions and giving them more authority over other party committees, such as those in businesses. The committees relay the intelligence they gather from grid managers to the police. Universities cause particular anxiety. Every big anti-government upheaval for more than a century has seen students at the forefront, including the May Fourth Movement of 1919, in which Mao participated. There is no sign of rebelliousness on campuses today. But Mr Xi is watchful. For universities to be run well, he said in 2016, they must be \u201cfirm strongholds\u201d of support for the party. Some, he lamented, were not strong enough. Two years later he called for \u201cresolute\u201d measures to prevent the spread of \u201cincorrect political trends of thought\u201d among students.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Once again, party members are used as his footsoldiers. Since the unrest of 1989 student party members, or applicants to join the party, have been deployed as\u00a0<em>xinxiyuan<\/em>, or informants. Their job is to submit regular reports to the party on topics being discussed by students and to snitch on anyone, including their own tutors, deemed to be erring ideologically. Under Mr Xi, their role has become more institutionalised, with campuses divided into grids. Each deploys\u00a0<em>xinxiyuan<\/em>\u00a0to monitor fellow students in their dormitories. Their intelligence is fed into campus computer systems.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Mr Xi has also put more effort than his post-Mao predecessors into ensuring the party operates inside private enterprises and\u00a0<small>ngo<\/small>s. Employees who are party members have formed cells (<em>xiaozu<\/em>) or branches (<em>zhibu<\/em>), one function of which is to keep an eye on workers and report potential trouble. Their chiefs often take part in neighbourhood party meetings that discuss threats to social stability. Under Mr Xi, the party is getting back into business.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>China\u2019s methods of surveillance Busybodies, backed by AI, are restoring the party\u2019s visibility How Communist Party members help to keep a close eye on Chinese citizens\u2014and on each other June 23rd 2021 ECONOMIST\u00a0 In 2018 xi jinping\u00a0visited one of Shanghai\u2019s &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2021\/06\/28\/surveillance-in-china\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-14970","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-uncategorized"],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p2Ncip-3Ts","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/14970","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=14970"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/14970\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":14971,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/14970\/revisions\/14971"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=14970"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=14970"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=14970"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
