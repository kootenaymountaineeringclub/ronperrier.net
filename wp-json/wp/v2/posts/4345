But have also been referred to as the Homelanders (grown up under the threat of terrorism), the Plurals (historic diversity) or the Founders (by MTV).<br \/>\nThey have no concept of life without the Internet, have billions in buying power and are already shaping our culture. Have grown up totally and utterly connected, there are concerns about their Google-fostered expectations that everything be instantaneous, their inability to tolerate even five seconds of boredom and the demands that come with maintaining several identities online from Facebook to Instagram to Snapchat. There is so much pressure on young people, who are still forming their identities, to present a crystallized, idealized identity online.<br \/>\nThere is optimism in their entrepreneurial spirit and finding ways to get offline. Their uberprotective Gen X parents, determined not to raise latchkey kids like themselves, are hovering and helping them digitally detox in screen-less camps and Waldorf schools.<br \/>\nThere are parallels to the Silent Generation, the doted-on, risk adverse, \u201cnice\u201d generation of kids who grew up during the Great Depression and WWII. Both came of age amid geopolitical turmoil and fears about the economy and schools emphasize a profound sensitivity to other kids. They will be known for being well-behaved and perhaps  \u201cblanding\u201d the culture by playing it safe.<br \/>\n<strong>Historic Events:<\/strong> Great Depression \u2022 WWII \u2022 The Cold War \u2022 McCarthyism \u2022 Started the Civil Rights Movement \u2022 Children were \u201cseen, but not heard\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>The Silent Generation is the demographic group of people born from the mid 1920s to the early 1940s. The name was originally applied to people in North America but has been applied as well to those in Western Europe, Australia and South America. It includes most of those who fought during the Korean War. In the United States, the generation was comparatively small because the financial insecurity of the 1930s and the war in the early 1940s caused people to have fewer children.<br \/>\nThe generation includes many civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, and Robert F. Kennedy and writers and artists like Gloria Steinem, Andy Warhol, Clint Eastwood, John Lennon, Ray Charles, Jimi Hendrix and the Beat Generation, and intellectuals like Noam Chomsky. Time magazine coined the name in a November 5, 1951 article entitled &#8220;The Younger Generation,&#8221; and the term has remained ever since. <\/p>\n<p><strong>General Thoughts on Social Reputation and Identity<\/strong><br \/>\nA child&#8217;s reputation is largely dependent upon the social status of his or her family.<br \/>\nA child will base his or her identity based on the implications that this reputation has in relation to both peers and adults.<br \/>\nDuring the Great Depression<br \/>\n<em>Identities for children<\/em> of this era were not clearly defined due to social ambiguities, which stemmed from economic losses in all social classes. In other words, a family&#8217;s economic loss lead to an uncertainty of social status; comparisons of past status versus present status left many children with ambiguous, yet malleable identities.<br \/>\nThe sense of &#8220;everyone being in the same boat&#8221; diminished the distinguishing characteristics of the social classes that had previously existed prior to the Depression.<br \/>\n<em>Characteristics of Children Born During This Era<\/em><br \/>\nThe generation of this era has generally been found to be ambitious, often seeking achievement, power and status. A need for achievement, status and power increased with higher degrees of economic depravity. Perhaps economic losses that affected a one&#8217;s family status left children with an ambitious desire to overcome such losses, leading to a generation of aspirations, goals, and purpose.<br \/>\nThis generation has also been found to be patriotic and trusting of the American government. Children growing up around the time of the Depression experienced a sense of trust in the government due to the efforts of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1933-1945), who&#8217;s New Deal programs quickly generated jobs and capital for the American people. Furthermore, this generation came of age during World War II, when patriotism ran high among American Citizens.<\/p>\n<p>The Silent Generation (born 1925-42) today comprises roughly 20 million adults in their 70s and 80s. Their age location in history sandwiches them awkwardly between two better-known generations: They were born just too late to be World War II heroes and just too early to be New Age firebrands. In their personal lives, this age location has been a source of tension. By the time the Silent were entering midlife, they spearheaded the divorce revolution and popularized the term \u201cmidlife crisis.\u201d But in their economic lives, this age location has been very good to them\u2014and given them a lifetime ride on the up-escalator coming off the American High.<\/p>\n<p>The Silent started out as the children of crisis.  They grew up while older people were fighting wars and making great sacrifices on their behalf.  Childrearing in America, already more protective for the G.I.s, approached the point of suffocation.<br \/>\nWhen the Silent began coming of age after World War II, they tiptoed cautiously in a post-crisis social order that no one wanted to disturb.  Unlike the G.I.s, they rarely talked about \u201cchanging the system,\u201d but instead about \u201cworking within the system.\u201d Because they didn\u2019t want anything to go on their \u201cpermanent records\u201d and kept their heads down during the McCarthy era, Time gave them the label \u201cSilent\u201d in a famous 1951 essay.<\/p>\n<p>They were also careful in the labour market. Fortune\u2019s story on the \u201cCollege Class of \u201849\u201d was subtitled \u201cTaking No Chances.\u201d When they went to job interviews, their first questions were about pension plans. They emulated their powerful G.I. elders by marrying and having babies incredibly young\u2014in fact, younger on average than any other generation in American history.<br \/>\nUnlike the G.I.s, the Silent didn\u2019t have to wait for a depression or war to end. A new \u201cbooming\u201d economy was ready to join right out of school. Demographer Richard Easterlin, in his 1980 book Birth and Fortune, called them the \u201cLucky\u201d or \u201cFortunate\u201d generation for their great timing. Easterlin noted that a remarkable feature of the Sputnik era was how the typical young man could earn more by age 30 than the average wage for men of all ages in his profess\u00acion\u2014and could certainly live better than most \u201cretired\u201d elders. He also noted that since the mid-1970s, the economic conditions facing young late-wave Boomers were becoming much tougher.<\/p>\n<p>At the time, Easterlin hypothesized that the Silent\u2014being small in number due to low birthrates during the 1930s and early \u201840s\u2014benefited from labour markets that bid up their wages in an era when young adults were relatively scarce. Later, as they retired, their small size has certainly helped make their pay-as-you-go Social Security and Medicare benefits seem more affordable.<br \/>\nYet the arrival of young-adult Gen Xers in the 1980s and \u201890s, who were also small in number but have fared miserably in the economy, throws this explanation into doubt. Numbers helped, but what helped the Silent even more was, again, their timing. Taught to play by the rules, this generation discovered at every age\u2014from the moment they married (at a median age of 21 in 1960) and purchased a house and car (soon thereafter)\u2014that playing by the rules always worked well for them.<\/p>\n<p>As the Silent have aged, their perfect timing has not let them down. Many of them locked in fixed 3% mortgages on their first homes in the 1960s just before inflation hit\u2014giving them decades of negative real interest rates. In the large corporations where so many of them worked, they signed up young for the defined-benefit pension plans their G.I. managers started\u2014the same plans that are now unraveling for Boomers. Their midlife high-savings decades roughly coincided, in 1980s and \u201890s, with perhaps the greatest bull market ever in both stocks and bonds. And after riding this bull, the Silent retired and sold out just before the crash hit. The last Silent cohort reached age 65 in 2007. Bingo.<br \/>\nThis is the only living generation that could half-believe, along with Woody Allen, that \u201c80 percent of life is just showing up,\u201d a joke that makes most Xers simply shake their heads.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of national leadership, the Silent\u2014unlike the G.I.s\u2014are not a powerful generation. They redefined leadership as more \u201cmaestro\u201d than \u201cmacho.\u201d They are the only generation in American history never to occupy the White House. In Presidents, we jumped from George Bush Sr., the World War II veteran, to Baby Boomer Bill Clinton.<\/p>\n<p>Yet they are without doubt the healthiest and most educated generation of elders that ever lived\u2014and, of course, the wealthiest. Coming of age fifty years ago, they quickly amassed more wealth than the seniors of that era. (Back in the early 1960s, the elderly were poorer than young adults by most measures.) In 2010, for the first time, the median net worth of households age 75+ ($228,400) is higher than that of any younger age bracket. Astoundingly, it\u2019s over five times higher than the median net worth of households age 35 to 44 ($44,600).<br \/>\nGiven their material good fortune, along with their instinct to help others in need, the Silent as elders have become economic anchors for America\u2019s new renaissance in multigenerational family living. Many routinely pay for extended-family vacations or subsidize their grown Boomer or Xer kids. Many have set up college trust funds for their grandkids\u2014and indeed, a record share have assumed formal custody of them. Most are worried about the economic challenges facing their families\u2014and wonder why success has become so much harder for them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Who: Grew up during the Great Depression and WWII \u2022 Either fought in WWII or were children \u2022 Behaviours are based on experiences during the Depression and WWII \u2022 Wealthiest generation \u2022 Men typically worked while women stayed home to &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2016\/01\/13\/silent-generation-born-1924-1943\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-4345","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-uncategorized"],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p2Ncip-185","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4345","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4345"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4345\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4345"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4345"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4345"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
