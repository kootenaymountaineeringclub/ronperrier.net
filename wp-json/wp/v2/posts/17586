Here\u2019s how meteorologists calculate it, and how to stay safe when winds kick up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When a record-breaking winter storm hit the northeast earlier this year, temperatures at the Mount Washington Observatory in New Hampshire\u00a0plummeted\u00a0to -47\u00b0F, but when the observatory factored in the 127 mph wind gusts battering the weather station, they produced a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-wHEwldMCfA\">wind chill temperature<\/a>\u00a0of -110\u00b0F.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Wind chill, mentioned in morning weather reports and noted in weather apps, is a measure of how cold the air feels on your skin. And, it\u2019s an essential forecast for public safety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">People exposed to -10\u00b0F and light winds can experience frostbite in 30 minutes, but increasing the wind speed to more than 60 mph can cause frostbite to occur in under five minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>How do meteorologists calculate wind chill?<br \/>\n<\/strong>When a person stands outside in the cold, their body begins to lose heat. But just like a person blowing heat away from a hot bowl of soup, cold winds whisk away body heat more quickly, making it feel colder outside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Calculating wind chill can help people better prepare for harsh outdoor conditions. Cold weather can cause hypothermia when the body\u2019s temperature falls below 95\u00b0F, or frostbite when body tissue freezes and could be permanently damaged.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Meteorologists calculate wind chill using\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.weather.gov\/safety\/cold-faqs\">a formula<\/a>\u00a0developed by the National Weather Service (NWS), which considers wind speed and air temperature. However, other factors, such as a sunny day, can make the temperature feel warmer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Why did we use it?<br \/>\n<\/strong>The term \u201cwind chill\u201d was first coined in 1939 by geographer and Antarctic explorer\u00a0Paul Siple. With his fellow explorer, Charles Passel, they experimented on how long it took to freeze water under different air and wind conditions. Using this data, they created formulas to determine how wind might affect the perceived temperature on the skin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Over time, their formulas have been refined with more precise computer models and human experiments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A\u00a0study\u00a0published in 2002 exposed six male and six female subjects to varying temperatures and wind speeds and measured heat loss through sensors placed on their faces.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">While these experiments helped scientists establish baseline data on how heat is lost from the body in healthy adults, some populations, including children, the elderly, and adults with health issues, face a greater risk from wind chill.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Other ways to measure how it feels outside<br \/>\n<\/strong>The formula used by the NWS to determine wind chill is not the only method used to calculate how environmental conditions affect the perceived temperature.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Weather forecasting service\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.accuweather.com\/en\/weather-news\/what-is-the-accuweather-realfeel-temperature\/156655\">AccuWeather<\/a> has its proprietary index called the RealFeel temperature. According to AccuWeather\u2019s chief meteorologist Jonathan Porter, their index factors in weather conditions that NWS\u2019s wind chill does not, such as dew point, cloud cover, and precipitation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Another model, more commonly used in Europe, is the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/23411753\/\">Universal Thermal Climate Index<\/a>, which also considers factors such as humidity and sunshine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The NWS uses only air temperature and wind speed in their wind chill estimate to provide a snapshot of the most influential weather conditions that influence how the temperature feels, using the most straightforward calculation, according to Michael Muccilli, the NWS Winter Program Coordinator.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>How to stay safe when the wind chill drops<br \/>\n<\/strong>Wind chill and other estimates of how cold it feels outside are ultimately forecast to help inform people about potentially deadly weather.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Stay inside when there\u2019s a risk of frostbite or hypothermia. If you must go outside, plan accordingly. Dress in layers, as many as three or more for extreme cold. Cover extremities like fingers and toes, wear a hat to prevent heat loss from your head, and ensure outer layers and shoes are waterproof. And take shelter from the wind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Remember that dangerous health issues, especially when the wind chill is at its most extreme, can take hold in minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/header>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Wind chill refers to the combined effect of air temperature and wind on how cold it feels.
