FOOTWEAR.<\/strong>\u00a0I have at least 5 types of kayak footwear: 2 pairs of knee-high neoprene boots, Keen sandals (terrible with sand or stone beaches as toe always full of stones), Ten Fingers (cumbersome to get on, drain well), very light river shoes (sole too thin on sharp rocks on the beach) and river shoes with a thicker sole.<br \/>\nIt may be best to wear footwear that you expect to get wet. Rubber boots work fine until water sneaks in over the top \u2013 maybe you wade in a little deep or maybe you capsize, miss your roll, and swim.<br \/>\nRiver shoes with a stiff, thicker sole, drain well, allow running, and won\u2019t fill with so much water that they become dangerous. Good foot care at the end of the day will prevent foot rot.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. DRY SUITS OR WET SUITS?<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Dry suits<\/strong> are great but when they fail, they fail catastrophically. Disadvantages a. Expensive b. An acute severe leak may add 20-30 pounds of water, a catastrophe. C. Eventually leak, any leak makes them useless. c. Gaskets wear out eventually d. Hot when hot out. Must develop a roll to keep cool e. Difficult bathroom access<br \/>\n<strong>Farmer John wet suits<\/strong> a. Inexpensive b. Warm when wet, never sit in a pool of water c. Warm when not wet. The vest portion stays dry and keeps core warm d. Comfortable cushioned layer against skin e. Shock absorbing if dealing with rocks f. Neoprene provides floatation if swimming g. If rips, no problem as the suit is designed to let a little water in. Easy to repair with glue. h. Buy with a zipper.<br \/>\nThe cold, clammy feeling when first put on lasts seconds. They warm up fast just from body heat. They smell after long expeditions. The best combination would be a two-piece wet suit with a sleeveless vest top and a bottom preferably with a crotch zipper. I have a Farmer Jane with a great zipper \u2013 very useful when urinating in a kayak.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\n3. GLOVES.<\/strong> Suggest that they never be used. Every gram on your paddle can translate into lifting an extra ton over the course of a month of paddling. Few actually keep hands very warm. Promote improper hand action so blisters common when not in use. Very thin pogies may be better.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\n4. HELMETS.<\/strong> Necessary when rolling in surf. One will eventually capsize.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. FEATHERED PADDLES\u00a0<\/strong><br \/>\nThe only theoretical advantage is less windage when paddling into a wind. Studies however have shown that this is of little consequence. And there are many disadvantages a. tendonitis and overuse injuries from having to roll your wrist b. impairs the ability to brace on the feathered side<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>1.
