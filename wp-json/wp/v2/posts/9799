It is a former colliery built between 1810 and 1830 by the French industrialist, Henri de Gorge. He employed the architect Bruno Renard to design the urban plan: neoclassical offices, the Chateau de George, colliery workshops, 450 miner\u2019s residences (each with its own private garden and exceptional comfort for the time), school, hospital, public squares, library, and a dance hall. In the mine, De Gorge pioneered new extraction techniques using steam engines, and the first horse-drawn railway in the country.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The site was abandoned in 1960 and allowed to disintegrate. It was purchased in 1971 by an architect who established his offices there. The Provincial government purchased the site in 1989 and finished the renovation, then proceeded to promote heritage, culture, tourism and contemporary design. In 2002, the Museum of Contemporary Art was established.

They are the largest and earliest concentration of ancient mines in Europe active during the mid and late Neolithic between 4,300 and 2,200 BC. They were inducted into the UNESCO&#8217;s list of World Heritage Sites in 2000.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The site is now devoted to agriculture and appears on the surface as a large area of meadows and fields strewn with millions of scraps of worked flint, material that was essential for the production of tools and cultural evolution generally. They demonstrate a seminal stage of human inventiveness, technological and cultural application and progress, the transition between opencast and underground mining.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Underground, the site is an immense network of galleries and caverns linked to the surface by vertical shafts. Different techniques were used, the most characteristic was the digging of shafts of 0.8 to 1.20m in diameter with a depth down to 16m. Neolithic populations could thus pass below levels made up of large blocks of flint (up to 2m in length) that they then extracted using a particular technique called \u2018striking\u2019 (freeing from below with support of a central chalk wall, shoring up of the block, removal of the wall, removal of the props and lowering of the block).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The density of the shafts is important, as many as 5,000 in the zone called Petit Spiennes (14 ha), leading to crisscrossing of pits and shafts in some sectors.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Stone-working workshops were associated with these mining shafts as is witnessed by numerous fragments of flint still present on the surface and which give its name to a part of the site, Camp \u00e0 Cayaux (Stone Field). The large slabs of flint weighed up to hundreds of kilos and the nodules were extracted using flint picks. The stones were then knapped into rough-out shapes of axes and finally polished to achieve the final state. Essentially the production aimed at the manufacture of axes to fell trees and long blades to be transformed into tools. The standardization of the production bears witness to the highly skilled craftsmanship of the stone-cutters. The vestiges of a fortified camp have also been discovered at the site comprising two irregular concentric pits at a distance of 5 to 10m. The archaeological artifacts discovered are characteristic of the Michelsberg culture discovered in the mining sector.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The rough-outs were exchanged over a wide area, about 150\u00a0km (93\u00a0mi), and were often polished at their destination. Polishing strengthens the final product, making the ax- or adze-head last longer. The smooth surface also aids the cutting action by lowering friction with the wood. The axes were used initially for forest clearance during the Neolithic period, and for shaping wood for structural applications, such as timber for huts and canoes.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Similar sites. The site has been compared with Grimes Graves and Cissbury in the United Kingdom, and Krzemionki in Poland, which are also sources of flintstone.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Neolithic Flint Museum SILEX<\/strong>. Drive through the village of Spiennes and follow the signs to Silex. The narrow paved road turns onto the gravel in a rural area between potato fields. Silex is a large metal round museum complex built over two shafts that connect to a large cavern in the chalk soil. There is nothing to see around the museum.

From the church in the center of Sombrelle head east and it is through a big stone gate on the left. In thick private woodlands, this castle has 3 round towers. Enter the courtyard to see the two-story chateau.

The area is just south of Brussels.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The main battlefield is known as Hameau du Lion (Lion Hamlet) some 5kms south of central Waterloo town.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><em>History.<\/em><\/strong> After a disastrous invasion of Russia and the 1813 loss at Leipzig, Napoleon Bonaparte was imprisoned on the Island of Elba, Yet on March 1, 1815, he escaped, landed in southern France, and with remarkable speed managed to muster a huge army. The European powers promptly declared war and choose Brussels as the point at which to form a combined army. However, in those pre-rail days, that could take weeks and Napoleon knew that time was of the essence. If he could meet either army individually, Napoleon\u2019s 124,000 men would outnumber roughly 106,000 Anglo-Dutch-Hanoverian troops or 117,000 Prussians. But he had to strike fast before the two combined.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">On June 16, Napoleon struck the Prussians at Ligny, where B\u00fbcher, the Prussian commander, was wounded and the Prussian army appeared to have been put to flight. Napoleon then turned his attention to British commander Wellington, whose forces were assembling at Waterloo, a carefully chose defensive position just south of Brussels.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The planned sunrise attack on June 18<sup>th<\/sup>\u00a0was delayed because of soggy ground, and a midmorning, the French attacked Hougourmont farm, vital for the defense of Wellington\u2019s rights. It fatally slowed Napoleon\u2019s game plan. The Prussians had regrouped by 1 pm and the battle at Plancenoit deprived Napoleon of vital men on the main battlefield. At 2 pm, a massive wave of French infantry marched on Wellington\u2019s left flank but thousands of Allied musketeers, hidden in ridgetop hedge, unleashed volleys of musket fire into the close-knit French formations. After this debacle, the French cavalry charged Wellington\u2019s center, but the infantrymen formed defensive squares and used their bayonets into impenetrable spikes. As the Prussians were approaching, the elite Imperial Guards made a desperate attempt to break through the center through mud churned up by the cavalry and the soldiers were mown down from their protected high ground.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Around 8:15 pm, Wellington led a full-scale advance, the French fell into a full retreat, and Napoleon fled abandoning his carriage at Genappe with its cache of diamonds. He abdicated a week later and spent the rest of his life in exile on St Helena.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><em>Hameau du Lion<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong><strong>Memorial 1815.<\/strong> The event\u2019s bicentenary saw the construction of this new showcase underground museum.
