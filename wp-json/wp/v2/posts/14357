I checked in, paid for the room for three nights A$157 x 3 = A$471 and bought a Digicel SIM for A$20 plus 2GB of data for A$21. I then went to bed sleeping through a lot of the day and reading. I bought some milk from the hotel restaurant A$8 for 1 litre and they gave me some sugar for free. For dinner, I had the meal I didn&#8217;t eat on the flight.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 2<\/strong> Sat Dec 30<br \/>\n<em>I was up well before daylight to eat and start the walk around the island before it got too hot but didn&#8217;t leave till 7 when 6 would have been better. I went counterclockwise so that the museum and the sights around Yaren would be open when I got there. The walk visits all the &#8220;sights&#8221; in Nauru except the phosphate field.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<strong>Walk around the island.<\/strong> The 19km sealed Island Ring Road circles the island. Community bus every hour (but not very useful as it comes hourly and only stops at infrequent bus stops). Hitchhiking is easy and the best way to get around. Cars or bicycles rented from Capelle and Partners. The drive takes about 25 minutes non-stop. A bicycle ride would take 2-3 hours and a walk maybe 5-6 hours. There is lots of nice scenery if not much to do. Cappelle &amp; Partner department store right at the top of the island in the Ewa district makes for a welcome break halfway around.<br \/>\nThe entire island is surrounded by a coral shelf that extends 100-150 m off the shore and where the surf breaks. The shelf is studded with jagged small columns of limestone and a few areas where the columns are 4-5 m tall. There are sandy\/pebble beaches only on the east coast between the Menen Hotel and Ewa Hotel. Most including Anibare Bay have small limestone columns covering the entire shelf but just south there is an area where the columns are missing for the first 30 m and may have the best swimming. Locals swim at the small port surrounded by a cement wall.<br \/>\nAs you walk around there are several small Chinese stores, basketball courts, many dogs (some free and many chained but none were threatening), chickens and two large groups of cyclists.<br \/>\nAnibare District, port with protected boat launch and guys fishing from the wall, Bay Restaurant (Asian\/Western fusion), Anibare Lodge (closed), two pill boxes and three no-name hotels (for construction or government workers?).<br \/>\n<strong>Anibare Bay<\/strong>\u00a0is the best for swimming as most beaches are too shallow and rocky.<br \/>\nAnetan District.<br \/>\n<strong>Capelle &amp; Partner<\/strong>\u00a0is the only department store and largest business in Nauru. The grocery store has a great selection, much better than anything else, in most small Chinese stores. Also has the Tropicana Cafe, bakery, bottle shop, and a bank with an ATM.

To get there, take the road opposite the Od-N-Aiwo Hotel, go left at the T to the lake, 1.7 km one-way.

I thought it was a moonscape but it is almost completely treed I entered one of the main access roads just above Menen Hotel and got a ride with a couple out for a drive. Pass the Nauru Prison (presently 38 prisoners), a large solar array, an Australian mining camp, some of the detention centres and finally the garbage landfill. I had asked to go to the top where WWII relics were thinking it was in the centre of the area but it is Command Ridge.<br \/>\nAlso up here is the Australian Immigration Detention Centre, 4 camps that once held up to 3,000 but presently had no one there. Those who were classified as Asylum could not leave the camps, whereas Refugees could leave.<br \/>\nMenin Hotel held a New Year&#8217;s Seafood Buffet Lunch from 12:30-2 pm for A$40. I thought I would go but when I saw the spread and no foreigners to sit with, I decided to have a fasting day.<br \/>\nThe day started windy and rainy but turned into a typical hot humid day. I slept, washed clothes, read &#8220;War Doctor&#8221; and took it easy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 4<\/strong> Mon Jan 1, 2024<br \/>\n<em>Flight.<\/em> Jan 1 INU\u2013TRW Nauru Airlines ON023 @07:15-08:30 A$350.50<\/p>\n<p><strong>HISTORY<\/strong><br \/>\nAlthough other island states may be smaller in area and\/or less populous, they are all dependent territories of other countries, so Nauru keeps the title of the world&#8217;s third-smallest independent republic.<br \/>\nFirst inhabited by Micronesians and Polynesians, Nauru was annexed by the German Empire in 1888. In 1900, Nauru&#8217;s phosphate deposits, which occupied about 90% of the island at the time, were discovered and began to be mined under a German-British consortium. During World War I, the island was occupied by Australian forces. After the war, the island became a League of Nations joint mandate (later a United Nations trusteeship after the Japanese occupation for three years during World War II) under Australia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand.<br \/>\nNauru achieved independence from Australia in 1968.<br \/>\nIn the years following independence, phosphate exports briefly gave Nauruans the highest per capita income in the world. The primary phosphate reserves were soon exhausted, crashing the local economy in the process, but in 2006\u201307, mining of a deeper layer of &#8220;secondary phosphate&#8221; began. As of 2016, most of Nauru&#8217;s revenue came from the export of phosphate. The industry is controlled by the Nauru Phosphate Corporation (NPC). It is anticipated that the phosphate reserves will be completely exhausted before 2050. The sale of fishing licences is the other major revenue raiser. Countries such as Australia and Taiwan provide substantial development cooperation funding. Despite this, the unemployment rate currently stands at 90%, which is the highest in the world. That is not the only problem on the island, as over 95% of the population is obese and over 40% suffer from Type 2 diabetes- the highest levels of obesity and diabetes in the world.<br \/>\nIn 2001, the Norwegian container ship Tampa rescued several hundred asylum seekers from a sinking Indonesian vessel and attempted to deliver them to Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean, which is an Australian Federal Territory. In what was labelled The Pacific Solution, the Australian Government established a controversial Off Shore Processing Centre (OPC) on Nauru where these people were housed, pending assessment of their claims to be refugees. The OPC was closed in early 2008 and re-opened in 2012. The OPC still remains very controversial owing to its extremely negative human rights record. As of 2016, there are approximately 470 people &#8211; chiefly of Middle Eastern origin &#8211; held in the OPC.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Climate.<\/strong> The climate is tropical, with some rain occurring between November and February.<br \/>\n<strong>Terrain. <\/strong>There are a few &#8220;sandy&#8221; beaches but most of the shallow area around the island is coral reefs. Most of the interior of the island is worked-out mining land, which is to be rehabilitated.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GET IN<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>By plane. <\/strong>Nauru&#8217;s national carrier\u00a0Nauru Airlines\u00a0flies to Nauru International Airport from\u00a0Brisbane\u00a0(Australia),\u00a0Tarawa\u00a0(Kiribati),\u00a0Majuro\u00a0(Marshall Islands),\u00a0Luganville\u00a0and\u00a0Port Vila\u00a0(Vanuatu) and\u00a0Nadi\u00a0(Fiji). Schedules change throughout the year; further details are available from the website.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GET AROUND<br \/>\n<\/strong>Nauru is so small that it takes less than one hour to drive right around it. The airport runway cuts across three of the twenty kilometres of road. The only traffic lights on the island are used to stop the traffic and allow the plane to cross the road to the terminal! This is a favourite souvenir snapshot taken by visitors.<br \/>\nTraffic drives on the left. The 19km Island Ring Road circles the island. Drivers should be on increased lookout for animals and pedestrians while driving on the beltway. There is a community bus which travels around the island every hour or so during the day. Cars or bicycles can sometimes be rented from Capelle and Partners, the largest local supermarket.<br \/>\n<strong>Talk. <\/strong>The official language is\u00a0Nauruan, a distinct Pacific Island language. Some locals speak Tuvaluan or Gilbertese which are quite common around the island since these two ethnic groups have historically worked in the Nauru mining industry.<br \/>\nEnglish\u00a0is widely understood, spoken, and used for most government and commercial purposes. It is\u00a0de facto\u00a0official language.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BUY<\/strong><br \/>\nNauru uses the Australian dollar ($) as its national currency. Cash transactions are the norm; credit cards are rarely accepted. There are 8 ATMs on the island; 1 is situated at Meneng Hotel, Capelle and Partner&#8217;s Supermarket, Nauru International Airport and 4 at the Bendigo Bank. ATMs frequently run out of money and go out of service as a result.<br \/>\nNauru t-shirts can be purchased at Capelle&#8217;s.<\/p>\n<p><strong>EAT<\/strong><br \/>\nFood is imported from Australia and arrives by ship and plane, usually every week as the vessels have been in operation regularly. There are lots of small &#8220;eating places&#8221;, selling Chinese food. There is a fast food kiosk at Capelle&#8217;s supermarket served by the locals and at Milton Ross supermarket served by Filipinos. There is also another fast food takeaway at McDon&#8217;s, serving Filipino dishes.<br \/>\nNauru has a serious obesity problem, as will become apparent as soon as you arrive. The decision to mine the phosphates led to an almost complete loss of agricultural land, with the result that almost everything is imported. Such imported foods are usually processed and high in sugar and fat. Several studies have cited the country as the fattest in the world.<br \/>\nDining in Nauru is a great experience. During your Nauru tours, enjoy all kinds of delicious and healthy dishes. Since Nauru is an island nation, seafood is very popular in its restaurants offered as authentic dishes. The cuisine of Nauru is highly influenced by the cuisines of countries such as Germany, Australia, China and Britain. You can savour all kinds of mouthwatering dishes in the various restaurants and bars in Nauru.<br \/>\nLocal-owned restaurants &#8216;Jules&#8217; and &#8216;Bay Restaurant&#8217; are popular names in the list of restaurants and bars in Nauru. <strong>Jules<\/strong> serves seafood delicacies from mussels, oysters and whatever you love from the ocean. &#8216;<strong>Bay Restaurant&#8217;<\/strong> serves Asian delicacies and a variety of pizza. Both places have various drinks to serve. Many other restaurants in Nauru are Chinese-owned. There are many food stalls on certain roadsides on the island where locals sell barbecue serves of variety dishes. If you crave for barbecue, keep an eye out for the &#8216;BBQ signs&#8217; by the roadsides. Nauru cuisine is very light because of the high temperature. Another popular area to eat is the &#8216;Eigigu takeaway&#8217; which serves local food. It is situated close to the Nauru Post office. Therefore, you will get to savour simple food items in the eateries of this country. The aroma and flavour of the delicacies of Nauru are unique to this country.<br \/>\nThe dishes offered in Nauru are a treat to the taste buds. Sushimi, Coconut fish and Meat are some of their main foods. Cooked and smoked hams are also very popular.<br \/>\n<strong>Drink.\u00a0<\/strong>The Reef Bar at the Menen Hotel is one of the only bars in Nauru. It is on the opposite side of the island from the Od-N-Aiwo, one of two other hotels in Nauru. It serves beers and international spirits. The bar has a couple of pool tables, satellite TV and recorded music. It&#8217;s lively at the weekends as there are sometimes local bands playing. There is also a huge flat screen located outside on the patio where there is a sea view of the background and guests and local friends do karaoke or sit and watch football matches live on weekends as part of their social outing.<br \/>\nThere is a bar called &#8216;Jules&#8217; in Denig district that is privately owned, and opened in 2012. New faces will be enthusiastically welcomed by the locals and the expats will usually have a chat, too. No flip flops\/thongs\/shorts (enclosed sandals are OK). The usual clothes for men is collar T-shirts or floral island shirts and skirts\/dresses for women. Standard clothing is highly recommended.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SLEEP<br \/>\n<\/strong>There are 3 hotels, the more expensive but brand new Budapest on the northeast coast, the original Menen on the east of the island and the budget Od&#8217;n Aiwo to the west. As of 2018 it was also possible to book alternative accommodations through Air BnB, such as a room in a guesthouse behind the airport. Note that these hotels are slow to respond to booking requests, and in order to successfully get the reservation confirmation as required by the Nauru tourist visa process you will likely need to follow up with the hotels several times.<br \/>\n<strong>Od&#8217;n Aiwo Hotel,<\/strong>\u00a0PO Box 299, Aiwo District, Republic of Nauru\u00a0(On the coastal belt road, to the west side of the island, directly opposite the road inland to Buada),\u00a0\u260e\u00a0(+674) 555 9203\u00a0(odnaiwo@yahoo.com).\u00a0The less expensive of the three hotels on Nauru.\u00a0USD40-80.<br \/>\n<strong>Menen Hotel,<\/strong>\u00a0PO Box 298, Anibare District, Republic of Nauru\u00a0(On the coastal belt road, to the east side of the island and south of Anibare Bay.),\u00a0\u260e\u00a0(+674) 557 8021\u00a0(menhotreservation@yahoo.com).\u00a0The Menen is Nauru&#8217;s largest hotel, boasting 119 rooms and conference facilities for up to 200.

Ask for advice before venturing into the water.<br \/>\nThe trafficking of drugs and narcotics of any kind will be punished severely.<br \/>\nAlthough homosexual acts in Nauru were legalised in 2016, open displays of affection between same-sex partners may offend some.<br \/>\nThe island hosts an immigration processing center for nearby Australia as a source of income. Do not trespass on the property.<br \/>\n<strong>Health. <\/strong>Water supply in Nauru is dependent on rainwater collected into tanks from the roofs of houses and from an ageing reverse osmosis desalination plant.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Respect. <\/strong>Be respectful to the native people and their environment. As the nation has one of the highest obesity rates in the world, pointing out someone&#8217;s obesity will almost always be taken poorly and cause offence. Use common sense, and avoid other actions that are considered rude internationally. Be respectful of the wildlife and nature, and remember that it has all been there long before any humans.<br \/>\nThe island nation allows freedom of religion, but most of the island practices Christianity, so be respectful of any and all religious practices. While the constitution allows any religion to be practiced, religious practices under the Church of Latter Day Saints and the Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses have been limited.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Contact. <\/strong>Cenpac Net is the internet service provider (ISP). Mobile phone and data is available from Digicel wireless. Digicel uses 900 MHz for 2G\/GSM and 3G\/UMTS\/HSPA+. 4G\/LTE was started in December 2016 on band 3 (1800 mhz). The whole island is covered.
