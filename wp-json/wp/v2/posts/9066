It is easier to see footholds, and your feet will grip them more securely.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Try not to use your knees&#8211; balance is ruined, and the next movement is restricted.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Keep your hands relatively low and avoid stretching full length for high handholds.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Make a few small movements of hands and feet to gain height rather than one long move. Be prepared to use small intermediate holds that are more stable for your balance.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Move slowly but steadily, planning a few moves, perhaps resting occasionally on good holds to think out a problematic move. Move smoothly, without jerkiness, and move one hand or foot at a time, keeping in safe balance with the other three limbs. Fit your method of approach to the holds available, and, as proper holds may lie hidden around a corner or within a small crack, search for possible holds on a difficult section before moving.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Plan your footholds carefully, and the handholds will seem to come almost automatically.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Learn to climb down anything that you can climb up, and how to reverse complex moves.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">If there are small rock outcrops near your home, use them as a practice ground before going on to bigger cliffs. By climbing up and down boulder problems, even though they may be only a few feet from the ground, your muscles will get used to the unusual movements of climbing, and you get the feel of your boots.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>6 KEYS to SLAB CLIMBING<br \/>\n<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s1\">Climbers typically fall into two camps when it comes to slabs. Some gag at the connotation of meat-grating, nipple-raking falls. But others say friction climbing is our most elegant discipline, a communion of mental grit and technical grace that rewards brains and finesse, not mindless brawn.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\" style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cI love, love, love slab climbing,\u201d says Beth Rodden, whose slab sends include Yosemite\u2019s <i>Lurking Fear<\/i> (VI 5.13c; FFA with Tommy Caldwell) and Squamish\u2019s <i>Grand Wall<\/i> (IV 5.13). \u201cTechnical climbing is so engaging. You have to figure out ways to stand on your feet and move your body with more than just pure strength. Maybe it\u2019s also because my arms are so twiggy.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\" style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Watching a skilled slab climber waltz up holdless granite is like watching a magic trick \u2014 you know a simple method unlocks what should be impossible, but it\u2019s still daunting to dissect how this happens. These six tips, gleaned from the world\u2019s best, will have you calmly padding upward. But first, put on a shirt \u2014 your nipples will thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><strong>1.<\/strong>\u00a0<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s1\"><b>Butt out\u2014heels down.<br \/>\n<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s1\">This mantra reminds you to \u201cassume the position,\u201d drawing your posterior away from the wall to align your centre of gravity over your feet. Thus aligned, slightly drop your heels, engaging the ball of your foot and maximizing the shoe-surface-to-rock ratio. Gravity and rubber will do the rest.<br \/>\nRemember those protractors from eighth-grade geometry? Well, neither do I, but think about it like this: your centre of gravity (core), which you control with your hips and rump, should align with gravity\u2019s pull. The rock angle shifts a bit; gravity stays constant. So if a slab\u2019s angle lessens, your butt should move away from the stone. If a slab becomes more vertical, you\u2019d likewise pull in your hips. I know \u2014 mind-blowing. We just passed eighth-grade geometry.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>2. Don\u2019t Dither Mentally.<br \/>\n<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s1\">\u201cFinding a [mental] rhythm helps a ton,\u201d says Rodden. <i>Lurking Fear\u2019s<\/i> crux \u2014 130 feet of sustained 5.13 slab divided by a sidewise dyno \u2014 necessitated steady, focused, upward flow. \u201cRhythm not only helps with general movement, but with maintaining head space,\u201d she adds. When holds begin to resemble potato chips or even disappear, our instinct is to get gripped \u2014 to tense our muscles, tighten our diaphragms, and slow to a crawl. \u201cThere is a huge anxiety associated with slab climbing,\u201d says slab ace Justen Sjong. \u201cIt\u2019s best to keep moving.\u201d So save thoughts like \u2018How am I attached?\u2019 for the campfire, not the sharp end.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>3. Don\u2019t Dither Physically.<br \/>\n<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s1\">We often divide pitches into sections, viewing rests as islands of safety. You can just drop this approach with slabs, where your only goal should be the belay. (Say you were in a hurry to get home from work. Sure, you\u2019d pause at red lights, but would you linger at the greens?) Clip the bolt, place a piece, and pause briefly to scan, but when you\u2019ve finished your business, move steadily (don\u2019t rush!) and breathe regularly, avoiding the dreaded sweaty palms or sewing machine leg that comes with stalling. (As you ooze with nervous perspiration, your calves tire, fingers slide, and feet slosh, making that crux even more difficult.)<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>4.<\/strong>\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\"><b>Your Hands = Your Feet.<br \/>\n<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s1\">Think of your hands as suction cups on the smooth underbelly of fear. Sometimes you\u2019re better off palming the rock than crimping down, which can pull your butt toward the wall. Stick to the mantra. The Scottish hardman Dave MacLeod, who last winter dispatched the 150-foot slab <i>Walk of Life <\/i>(5.13 or 5.14 R\/X, depending on whom you ask), at North Devon, UK, suggests you use your thumbs \u2014 not palms \u2014 to press down on holds. MacLeod\u2019s tip comes in handy when you\u2019re forced to high-step or hand-foot match. Imagine cocking a revolver \u2014 your thumb becomes a hook that holds you in.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>5. Don\u2019t Overreach.<br \/>\n<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s1\">As runouts grow, it can be tempting to stretch for handholds: patience, young grasshopper. By overextending, you bring your centre of gravity closer to the wall, decreasing rubber-to-rock contact. Instead, resume \u201cthe position,\u201d and then make small, calculated hand and foot movements. Also, avoid undue high stepping \u2014 bigger moves lead to herky-jerky movements that destabilize your core, precipitating foot slips. \u201cIt\u2019s not like a boulder problem or physical route,\u201d adds Rodden. \u201cYou can\u2019t try so hard that you\u2019re violent. Instead, be determined but calm,\u201c saving the dynamic climbing for boulderers.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>6. Avoid the Pump . . . in Your Calves.<br \/>\n<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s1\">Slab climbing can be a tiring, tedious affair. MacLeod seeks to rest his feet. \u201cWhen you reach better [foot] holds, rest your feet by standing on your heels,\u201d he says. Look for scoops or rails. If you find a single, big-enough-for-one foothold, you can methodically switch feet, stretching or even shaking out the unweighted appendage like it\u2019s a forearm.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SOME NOTES ON TECHNIQUE by John Carter Movements on a climb should be rhythmic, poised and relaxed to conserve energy.
