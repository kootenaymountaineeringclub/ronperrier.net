The elevation of the pass is 1775m (5823\u2019), the highest point of Highway 3. Part of the 1133 hectare Stagleap Provincial Park, the pass is famous for its early and late season snow as well as being the highest-served pass in BC that is open year round (closed occasionally for avalanche danger).<br \/>\nThis area is a popular backcountry skiing\/snow shoeing destination in the winter. Unlike resort based routes, the ski tours are all completely backcountry. There are no lifts, no lodges and no people nearby.
