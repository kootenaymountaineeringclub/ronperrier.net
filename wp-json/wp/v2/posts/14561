I stopped in at the police office at the ferry and they checked my visa and photocopied my passport but no stamps.

There were hundreds of big trucks and maybe 25 buses waiting at the border. There is nothing to eat or buy here and I sleep on the bus. This bus is only going to the border. The Sudanese guys on the bus are very kind &#8211; one makes buns with either halva or cheese (I have three) and a group in the next bus get lentils from ours and make a tasty lentil stew that seven of us eat with pita.

This took quite a while and I think I missed the bus I crossed the gate with and then waited to board another bus. There is a restaurant at immigration.

Two very nice Sudanese guys found where to buy a bus ticket for Meroe (actually Karima which is across the river). There was an option to leave now for Dongala and catch another minivan from there to Meroe, but I was tired after my poor sleep on the bus at the border, so decided to stay in Wadi Halfa.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>Hotels:<\/em> The range is from 3-400 for a bare, filthy room with 3 ugly beds.

I ended up walking to the very end of the street (towards the lake) to the Nubian Hotel (10,000 SP, about $18) and of course, it had vacancies. Quite an increase but it at least looked like a normal hotel room with A\/C and an ensuite bathroom. I had to beg for a towel, there was no BF and no toilet paper (getting the guy, even using Google Translate to figure this out was a quest). But the shower was hot, the bed comfortable and I charged everything. I watched the World Cup final between Argentina and France which went to the bitter end.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Day 2<\/strong> Mon Dec 19<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>Up early, I showered and walked down to the share van street and bought a ticket to Karima (across the river from Meroe) 15,000 SP (27$). Bus rides are quite expensive here although this is a 578 km and 8+ hour trip. I could have taken a bus that left at 4 am but elected this to get maximum benefit from the expensive hotel. I had tea, a coffee and 6 deep-fried fritters while waiting.<br \/>\nWith an expected departure at 8, they didn&#8217;t start loading the roof (4 feet of stuff) until 09:45 and didn&#8217;t tie it down until 11:30. Like all share vans, they tend to not leave until full, but we eventually left at 11:50 with 7 passengers in the 15 passenger van. I luckily had a front seat. Music videos blared and I finally put in earplugs that only partially worked. At 1:15, we stopped to pick up a guy with 3 large nylon bags, a huge heavy gunny sack, a 10-gallon gas can, personal clothes and a large outboard boat motor that they tied down at the front of the roof. Along for the ride came 10 flies that tormented us. I wonder if he paid the same as me?<br \/>\nThe road had enough potholes to slow things down, We passed through desert with virtually no plants except thistle in the disturbed ditches, sand and low rocky hills.<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The land became much flatter and a large mountain appeared to the west. The soldier riding next to me said that the name was Date Palm and then he said Barkal.<br \/>\n<\/span>At 3 pm, we had a flat tire &#8211; the tire had literally exploded and was completely delaminated. The van was so overloaded and the tire so flat, that all 9 passengers had to rock the van to get the jack under it. Outside my legs were instantly covered with 100s of tiny bugs that bit leaving small hemorrhagic lesions.<br \/>\nThe load at the back shifted and hung way over to the right. We drop off some and pick up others and the back of the van is full of stuff. The old guy picked up three television sets. A huge box wrapped in dirty burlap is right behind me.<br \/>\nAt 18:20, we are at Dongala and only 173 km to go. It has been dark for an hour. I have no idea where I will sleep tonight, somewhere in Karima. The driver talks almost nonstop on the phone which I find irritating.<br \/>\nWe finally arrived in Karima at 8:20 pm. They undid enough ties on the load to be able to get my pack.<br \/>\nON The army guy showed me a hotel &#8211; Al Nassr &#8211; 4000 SP ($7) for 2 beds and a fan, BR outside (very rough, filthy with pit toilets and a tap in the large basin), extremely dirty room with cigarette butts and sand all over the floor and lining the walls but what the hell, I was only going to sleep and leave immediately in the morning. Thankfully I have a pee bottle, headlight, sleep sheet and sleeping bag to protect me (along with DEET) from all the no serums and to stay warm. A nice room with an ensuite and clean floors was 8000, but the beds were identical and the bugs the same.

Tombs, with and without pyramids, temples, living complexes and palaces, are to be found on the site.

The Aksumite invasion, coupled with the overuse of the land leading to desertification, led to the rapid decline of Meroe.

Around 2500 BC, one of the earliest urban centres in sub-Saharan Africa developed there and flourished between 2500 and 1500 BC and encompassed the area from the 1<sup>st<\/sup>\u00a0to the 5<sup>th<\/sup> cataracts at its height. Kerma is located 45km north of the modern city of Dongola, The town of Kerma has well-developed architecture which includes elaborate defences, an important religious quarter located at its heart, and countless domestic buildings, storage magazines, administrative and industrial complexes. The remains of the capital city surround the Western Deffufa, a large mud brick temple, 18m high, surrounded by the religious quarter. The settlement also contains a royal audience hall, and palace and was partly fortified. The audience hall was a large round mud structure, which had been rebuilt several times in the same location and likely had a conical roof supported by three or four rows of wooden columns. Kerma had a rich material culture typified by extremely fine handmade pottery; a thin-walled red-polished ware with a black-topped rim as well as bronzes, ivories and faience. Products were traded from Egypt, Central Africa and the shores of the Red Sea and seals and seal impressions testify to these exchanges.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">An extensive cemetery lies to the east of the town and contains royal burial tumuli, funerary chapels and temples, notably that of the Eastern Deffufa. The monuments of the Eastern and the Western Deffufas represent unique and outstanding examples of massive mudbrick buildings, which reflect the traditional architecture and technology at a significant stage in the history of Sudan in antiquity. Wealth and power were displayed in the royal tombs of the Kerma kings and in those of the nobility as may be demonstrated by the large number of associated cattle sacrifices. One tomb, perhaps of a king of the Middle Kerma period (2050\u20131750BC) consisted of a grave 11.7m in diameter and 2m deep, covered by a mound that reached 25m across. More than 4,000 cattle bucrania were arranged in a crescent shape on the south side of the mound. The tombs of the later Kerma kings were even more impressive. From 1700 BC, the Kingdom of Kush was the most powerful state in the Nile Valley. Buried under mounds up to 90m in diameter, these rulers were accompanied to their deaths by as many as 400 sacrificed humans, amongst whom may have been members of the king\u2019s family, retainers, and prisoners of war, though their identities remain uncertain.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">One kilometre north of the Nubian capital preserved the remains of an extraordinary ceremonial city of <strong>Dokki Geil<\/strong>, which was founded by Egyptian pharaohs of Dynasty 18 after the destruction of Kerma (1750-1500 BC). It has oval or circular temples and palaces of surprising size. Palace A is 55 by 49 m, and has a \u201cforest\u201d of 1400 columns supporting a huge roofing made of beams and palm fibres.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">During the conquest of the territory by Thutmose I, a menenu was established on the spot of the razed city of Dukki Gel.

Influence from Egypt includes pottery and grave goods: Egyptian ceramics from Avaris, such as\u00a0Tell el-Yahudiyeh Ware, scarab seals and amulets indicate extensive trade with\u00a0ancient Egypt. After the sacking of Kerma, the cemetery was used to host the kings of the 25th or &#8220;Napatan&#8221; dynasty of the\u00a0Kingdom of Kush\u00a0from Upper (Southern) Nubia.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><br \/>\nAl Khandaq Village<\/strong>\u00a0is a town in northern Sudan\u00a0on the\u00a0River Nile, the site of an important fortress with beginnings dating to the Christian period.
