First preschool, kindergarten, elementary school, junior high, and high school. Then a bachelor\u2019s degree at UC Berkeley, followed by a doctoral program at Princeton. The next step was what you could call my first \u201creal\u201d job\u2014as an economics professor at George Mason University.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to tenure, I have a dream job for life. Personally, I have no reason to lash out at our system of higher education. Yet a lifetime of experience, plus a quarter century of reading and reflection, has convinced me that it is a big waste of time and money. When politicians vow to send more Americans to college, I can\u2019t help gasping, \u201cWhy? You want us to waste even more?\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"c-ad c-ad--house ad-housepromo-d-wrapper\" data-template=\"hippo\/components\/ads\/article-house-desktop.html\" data-pos=\"housepromo-d\">\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_\/4624\/TheAtlanticOnline\/channel_education\/article2.0.0_1__container__\">\n<section class=\"ha-c-mag-promo\">\n<div class=\"ha-c-mag-promo__container\">\n<div class=\"ha-c-mag-promo__subscribe\">\n<div class=\"ha-c-mag-promo__text\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>How, you may ask, can anyone call higher education wasteful in an age when its financial payoff is greater than ever? The earnings premium for college graduates has rocketed to 73 percent\u2014that is, those with a bachelor\u2019s degree earn, on average, 73 percent more than those who have only a high-school diploma, up from about 50 percent in the late 1970s. The key issue, however, isn\u2019t whether college pays, but why. The simple, popular answer is that schools teach students useful job skills. But this dodges puzzling questions.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<aside class=\"l-rail l-rail--right l-rail--1\" role=\"complementary\">\n<div class=\"c-ad s-native s-native--standard s-native--small c-ad--unlabeled ad-boxrr-wrapper\" data-section=\"side\" data-template=\"hippo\/components\/ads\/rail.html\" data-pos=\"boxrr\">\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_\/4624\/TheAtlanticOnline\/channel_education\/article2.0.0_3__container__\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">First and foremost: From kindergarten on, students spend thousands of hours studying subjects irrelevant to the modern labor market. Why do English classes focus on literature and poetry instead of business and technical writing? Why do advanced-math classes bother with proofs almost no student can follow? When will the typical student use history? Trigonometry? Art? Music? Physics? Latin? The class clown who snarks \u201cWhat does this have to do with real life?\u201d is onto something.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"blah\">\n<div class=\"l-article__container__container\">\n<section id=\"article-section-1\" class=\"l-article__section s-cms-content\">\n<div class=\"c-ad c-ad--full-width c-ad--unlabeled s-native s-native--standard s-native--small ad-native-only-wrapper\" data-template=\"hippo\/components\/ads\/native-mobile.html\" data-native=\"True\" data-pos=\"native-only\"><\/div>\n<p>The disconnect between college curricula and the job market has a banal explanation: Educators teach what they know\u2014and most have as little firsthand knowledge of the modern workplace as I do. Yet this merely complicates the puzzle. If schools aim to boost students\u2019 future income by teaching job skills, why do they entrust students\u2019 education to people so detached from the real world? Because, despite the chasm between what students learn and what workers do, academic success is a strong signal of worker productivity.<\/p>\n<p>Suppose your law firm wants a summer associate. A law student with a doctorate in philosophy from Stanford applies. What do you infer? The applicant is probably brilliant, diligent, and willing to tolerate serious boredom. If you\u2019re looking for that kind of worker\u2014and what employer isn\u2019t?\u2014you\u2019ll make an offer, knowing full well that nothing the philosopher learned at Stanford will be relevant to this job.<\/p>\n<p>The labor market doesn\u2019t pay you for the useless subjects you master; it pays you for the preexisting traits you signal by mastering them. This is not a fringe idea. Michael Spence, Kenneth Arrow, and Joseph Stiglitz\u2014all Nobel laureates in economics\u2014made seminal contributions to the theory of educational signaling. Every college student who does the least work required to get good grades silently endorses the theory. But signaling plays almost no role in public discourse or policy making. As a society, we continue to push ever larger numbers of students into ever higher levels of education. The main effect is not better jobs or greater skill levels, but a credentialist arms race.<\/p>\n<p>Lest I be misinterpreted, I emphatically affirm that education confers some marketable skills, namely literacy and numeracy. Nonetheless, I believe that signaling accounts for at least half of college\u2019s financial reward, and probably more.<\/p>\n<p>Most of the salary payoff for college comes from crossing the graduation finish line. Suppose you drop out after a year. You\u2019ll receive a salary bump compared with someone who\u2019s attended no college, but it won\u2019t be anywhere near 25 percent of the salary premium you\u2019d get for a four-year degree. Similarly, the premium for sophomore year is nowhere near 50 percent of the return on a bachelor\u2019s degree, and the premium for junior year is nowhere near 75 percent of that return. Indeed, in the average study, senior year of college brings more than twice the pay increase of freshman, sophomore, and junior years combined. Unless colleges delay job training until the very end, signaling is practically the only explanation. This in turn implies a mountain of wasted resources\u2014time and money that would be better spent preparing students for the jobs they\u2019re likely to do.<picture><\/picture>\n<p class=\"dropcap\">T<span class=\"smallcaps\">he conventional view\u2014<\/span>that education pays because students learn\u2014assumes that the typical student acquires, and retains, a lot of knowledge. She doesn\u2019t. Teachers often lament summer learning loss: Students know less at the end of summer than they did at the beginning. But summer learning loss is only a special case of the problem of fade-out: Human beings have trouble retaining knowledge they rarely use. Of course, some college graduates use what they\u2019ve learned and thus hold on to it\u2014engineers and other quantitative types, for example, retain a lot of math. But when we measure what the average college graduate recalls years later, the results are discouraging, to say the least.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"blah\">\n<div class=\"l-article__container__container\">\n<section id=\"article-section-2\" class=\"l-article__section s-cms-content\">\n<div class=\"c-ad c-ad--full-width s-native s-native--standard s-native--small ad-boxinjector-m-wrapper\" data-template=\"hippo\/components\/ads\/article-mobile.html\" data-pos=\"boxinjector-m\"><\/div>\n<p>In 2003, the United States Department of Education gave about 18,000 Americans the National Assessment of Adult Literacy. The ignorance it revealed is mind-numbing. Fewer than a third of college graduates\u00a0received a composite score of \u201cproficient\u201d\u2014and about a fifth were at the \u201cbasic\u201d or \u201cbelow basic\u201d level. You could blame the difficulty of the questions\u2014until you read them. Plenty of college graduates couldn\u2019t make sense of a table explaining how an employee\u2019s annual health-insurance costs varied with income and family size, or summarize the work-experience requirements in a job ad, or even use a newspaper schedule to find when a television program ended. Tests of college graduates\u2019 knowledge of history, civics, and science have had similarly dismal results.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, college students aren\u2019t supposed to just download facts; they\u2019re supposed to learn how to think in real life. How do they fare on this count? The most focused study of education\u2019s effect on applied reasoning, conducted by Harvard\u2019s David Perkins in the mid-1980s, assessed students\u2019 oral responses to questions designed to measure informal reasoning, such as \u201cWould a proposed law in Massachusetts requiring a five-cent deposit on bottles and cans significantly reduce litter?\u201d The benefit of college seemed to be zero: Fourth-year students did no better than first-year students.<\/p>\n<p>Other evidence is equally discouraging. One researcher tested Arizona State University students\u2019 ability to \u201capply statistical and methodological concepts to reasoning about everyday-life events.\u201d In the researcher\u2019s words:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Of the several hundred students tested, many of whom had taken more than six years of laboratory science \u2026 and advanced mathematics through calculus, almost none demonstrated even a semblance of acceptable methodological reasoning.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Those who believe that college is about learning how to learn should expect students who study science to absorb the scientific method, then habitually use it to analyze the world. This scarcely occurs.<\/p>\n<p>College students do hone some kinds of reasoning that are specific to their major. One ambitious study at the University of Michigan tested natural-science, humanities, and psychology and other social-science majors on verbal reasoning, statistical reasoning, and conditional reasoning during the first semester of their first year. When the same students were retested the second semester of their fourth year, each group had sharply improved in precisely one area. Psychology and other social-science majors had become much better at statistical reasoning. Natural-science and humanities majors had become much better at conditional reasoning\u2014analyzing \u201cif \u2026 then\u201d and \u201cif and only if\u201d problems. In the remaining areas, however, gains after three and a half years of college were modest or nonexistent. The takeaway: Psychology students use statistics, so they improve in statistics; chemistry students rarely encounter statistics, so they don\u2019t improve in statistics. If all goes well, students learn what they study and practice.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"blah\">\n<div class=\"l-article__container__container\">\n<section id=\"article-section-3\" class=\"l-article__section s-cms-content\">Actually, that\u2019s optimistic. Educational psychologists have discovered that much of our knowledge is \u201cinert.\u201d Students who excel on exams frequently fail to apply their knowledge to the real world. Take physics. As the Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner writes,<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Students who receive honor grades in college-level physics courses are frequently unable to solve basic problems and questions encountered in a form slightly different from that on which they have been formally instructed and tested.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The same goes for students of biology, mathematics, statistics, and, I\u2019m embarrassed to say, economics. I try to teach my students to connect lectures to the real world and daily life. My exams are designed to measure comprehension, not memorization. Yet in a good class, four test-takers out of 40 demonstrate true economic understanding.<\/p>\n<p class=\"dropcap\">E<span class=\"smallcaps\">conomists\u2019 educational bean counting<\/span> can come off as annoyingly narrow. Non-economists\u2014also known as normal human beings\u2014lean holistic: We can\u2019t measure education\u2019s social benefits solely with test scores or salary premiums. Instead we must ask ourselves what kind of society we want to live in\u2014an educated one or an ignorant one?<\/p>\n<p>Normal human beings make a solid point: We can and should investigate education\u2019s broad social implications. When humanists consider my calculations of education\u2019s returns, they assume I\u2019m being a typical cynical economist, oblivious to the ideals so many educators hold dear. I am an economist and I am a cynic, but I\u2019m not a typical cynical economist. I\u2019m a cynical idealist. I embrace the ideal of transformative education. I believe wholeheartedly in the life of the mind. What I\u2019m cynical about is people.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m cynical about students. The vast majority are philistines. I\u2019m cynical about teachers. The vast majority are uninspiring. I\u2019m cynical about \u201cdeciders\u201d\u2014the school officials who control what students study. The vast majority think they\u2019ve done their job as long as students comply.<\/p>\n<p>Those who search their memory will find noble exceptions to these sad rules. I have known plenty of eager students and passionate educators, and a few wise deciders. Still, my 40 years in the education industry leave no doubt that they are hopelessly outnumbered. Meritorious education survives but does not thrive.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, today\u2019s college students are less willing than those of previous generations to do the bare minimum of showing up for class and temporarily learning whatever\u2019s on the test. Fifty years ago, college was a full-time job. The typical student spent 40 hours a week in class or studying. Effort has since collapsed across the board. \u201cFull time\u201d college students now average 27 hours of academic work a week\u2014including just 14 hours spent studying.<\/p>\n<p>What are students doing with their extra free time? Having fun. As Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa frostily remark in their 2011 book, <i>Academically Adrift<\/i>,<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>If we presume that students are sleeping eight hours a night, which is a generous assumption given their tardiness and at times disheveled appearance in early morning classes, that leaves 85 hours a week for other activities.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Arum and Roksa cite a study finding that students at one typical college spent 13 hours a week studying, 12 hours \u201csocializing with friends,\u201d 11 hours \u201cusing computers for fun,\u201d eight hours working for pay, six hours watching TV, six hours exercising, five hours on \u201chobbies,\u201d and three hours on \u201cother forms of entertainment.\u201d Grade inflation completes the idyllic package by shielding students from negative feedback. The average GPA is now 3.2.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"blah\">\n<div class=\"l-article__container__container\">\n<section id=\"article-section-4\" class=\"l-article__section s-cms-content\">\n<p class=\"dropcap\">W<span class=\"smallcaps\">hat does this mean<\/span> for the individual student? Would I advise an academically well-prepared 18-year-old to skip college because she won\u2019t learn much of value? Absolutely not. Studying irrelevancies for the next four years will impress future employers and raise her income potential. If she tried to leap straight into her first white-collar job, insisting, \u201cI have the right stuff to graduate, I just choose not to,\u201d employers wouldn\u2019t believe her. To unilaterally curtail your education is to relegate yourself to a lower-quality pool of workers. For the individual, college pays.<\/p>\n<p>This does not mean, however, that higher education paves the way to general prosperity or social justice. When we look at countries around the world, a year of education appears to raise an individual\u2019s income by 8 to 11 percent. By contrast, increasing education across a country\u2019s population by an average of one year per person raises the national income by only 1 to 3 percent. In other words, education enriches individuals much more than it enriches nations.<\/p>\n<p>How is this possible? Credential inflation: As the average level of education rises, you need more education to convince employers you\u2019re worthy of any specific job. One research team found that from the early 1970s through the mid\u20111990s, the average education level within 500 occupational categories rose by 1.2 years. But most of the jobs didn\u2019t change much over that span\u2014there\u2019s no reason, except credential inflation, why people should have needed more education to do them in 1995 than in 1975. What\u2019s more, <i>all<\/i> American workers\u2019 education rose by 1.5 years in that same span\u2014which is to say that a great majority of the extra education workers received was deployed not to get <i>better<\/i> jobs, but to get jobs that had recently been held by people with less education.<\/p>\n<p>As credentials proliferate, so do failed efforts to acquire them. Students can and do pay tuition, kill a year, and flunk their finals. Any respectable verdict on the value of education must account for these academic bankruptcies. Failure rates are high, particularly for students with low high-school grades and test scores; all told, about 60 percent of full-time college students fail to finish in four years. Simply put, the push for broader college education has steered too many students who aren\u2019t cut out for academic success onto the college track.<\/p>\n<p>The college-for-all mentality has fostered neglect of a realistic substitute: vocational education. It takes many guises\u2014classroom training, apprenticeships and other types of on-the-job training, and straight-up work experience\u2014but they have much in common. All vocational education teaches specific job skills, and all vocational education revolves around learning by doing, not learning by listening. Research, though a bit sparse, suggests that vocational education raises pay, reduces unemployment, and increases the rate of high-school completion.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"blah\">\n<div class=\"l-article__container__container\">\n<section id=\"article-section-5\" class=\"l-article__section s-cms-content\">Defenders of traditional education often appeal to the obscurity of the future. What\u2019s the point of prepping students for the economy of 2018, when they\u2019ll be employed in the economy of 2025 or 2050? But ignorance of the future is no reason to prepare students for occupations they almost surely won\u2019t have\u2014and if we know anything about the future of work, we know that the demand for authors, historians, political scientists, physicists, and mathematicians will stay low. It\u2019s tempting to say that students on the college track can always turn to vocational education as a Plan B, but this ignores the disturbing possibility that after they crash, they\u2019ll be too embittered to go back and learn a trade. The vast American underclass shows that this disturbing possibility is already our reality.<\/p>\n<p>Education is so integral to modern life that we take it for granted. Young people have to leap through interminable academic hoops to secure their place in the adult world. My thesis, in a single sentence: Civilized societies revolve around education now, but there is a better\u2014indeed, more civilized\u2014way. If everyone had a college degree, the result would be not great jobs for all, but runaway credential inflation. Trying to spread success with education spreads education but not success.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><small><em>This essay is adapted from Bryan Caplan\u2019s book <\/em>The Case Against Education<em>.
