The mosaic of diverse climatic conditions found in the West Kootenay produced an equally diverse range of plant communities. The region is a botanist&#8217;s dream.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Ecologists classify plant communities as belonging to specific &#8220;biogeoclimatic zones&#8221;, a term referring to the combination of climate, soil type and plant species that interact to produce a characteristic plant community. Four biogeoclimatic zones are represented in the West Kootenay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>1. Interior Western Hemlock Zone<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Frequently called the Interior Wet Belt, this plant community thrives at the lower elevation of the northern two-thirds of the region, where the high peaks have squeezed abundant moisture from the clouds. Here, the heavy winter snowfalls and warm summers have produced impressive mature forests. Western hemlock, western red cedar, grand fir, Douglas-fir, western white pine and western yew are common, while on the forest floor, ferns, devil&#8217;s club and moss predominate. Flowers include queen&#8217;s cup, trillium, wild ginger, spotted coral root and calypso orchid, to name but a few.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> In the drier southern parts of the region, we find a transitional forest of the Interior Western Hemlock zone. There is a tremendous variety of tree species in this zone, with one, the western larch, being characteristic. An unusual feature of this conifer is displayed each fall when its needles turn golden and are shed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>2. Interior Douglas-For Zone<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> This forest community, found in drier areas, is represented at lower elevations in the southwest Selkirks. Here, mature forests are relatively open, allowing for more abundant growth of shrubs and small trees. Characteristic trees include Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine and trembling aspen. Common shrubs are False Box, kinnikinnick, soopolallie and Oregon Grape.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> In certain areas, mostly dry, sunny slopes, the Interior Douglas-fir zone resembles the more arid Ponderosa Pine-Bunchgrass zone. Characterized by open, grassy hillsides dotted with ponderosa pines, this distinctive plant community is best represented around Deer Park, north of Castlegar.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> An excellent example of the Interior Douglas-Fir community at its wettest is Champion Lakes Provincial Park, located above Trail. Here, the zone mingles with the Interior Western Hemlock forest to produce a tremendously diverse transitional community, with twelve species of conifers occurring at the same elevations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>3. Engelman Spruce-Subalpine Fir Zone<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> This plant community generally prevails everywhere in the region at elevations of between 1524m and 2286m (5000 to 7500 ft). Only plants that can tolerate long winters and short summer growing seasons survive here. The Engelman spruce and the subalpine fir are shaped for survival; their conical form is ideal for preventing heavy buildups of potentially dangerous snow.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Mature stands of this forest are generally well-spaced, allowing for the luxuriant growth of low shrubs and flowers. At high elevations near timberline, the forest openings in summer are vibrant flower gardens. Common shrubs are blue and lack mountain huckleberries, white rhododendrons, mountain ash and twinberry. Flowers include red and yellow monkeyflowers, arnica, Indian paintbrush, mountain valerian and monkshood.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>4. Alpine Tundra Zone<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The land above the timberline is designated alpine tundra, but timberline is not a definitive term. High above the forested slopes, trees such as subalpine fir, whitebark pine, and Lyall&#8217;s larch survive; in sheltered pockets, though dwarfed, they retain their tree shapes, whereas on more exposed sites they become Krummholz &#8211; dense, low-lying forms that hug the earth like blankets.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> To appreciate the hardships of life in the alpine zone, one needs only look at the twisted and contorted forms of these tangled old dwarfs, surviving here against all odds. They symbolize life in the alpine: fragile, yet tenacious. And when you visit this delicate area, be especially considerate, for damage done here may take hundreds of years to repair.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> In summer, the meadows come alive with colour and scent. The heavy snows of winter, which have locked up life for ten months, melt to provide ample moisture, and the shrubs and flowers, free from a shading forest canopy, are drenched with intense sunlight. Life explodes.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Time is the key. Within the few weeks of an alpine summer, a plant must flower, reproduce and store food for the future. Most species, like the western anemone, are geared for this race. Using stored food energy from its tuberous rootstock, it pushes its bloom through the still-melting snow. For frost and moisture protection, the anemone has an insulating covering of fine hairs, and its bloom, in the shape of a parabolic disc, collects the sun&#8217;s rays to warm its developing ovaries.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Insects are as vital to the survival of plants as they are. In their rush to live a year in a month, both alpine flowers and the insects that feed upon them conduct an intense struggle for survival, the insects competing with one another for plant food sources, and the plants, with the lure of colour and scent, competing for pollinating insects. The vivid colours, heady fragrances and steady humming sounds of an alpine meadow are testimony to this dramatic urgency.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The alpine community in the West Kootenay is blessed with an abundance of plant species. Many field guides are available to help you identify and enjoy the flora here, and I recommend carrying one when you visit the sensational floral displays found in summer above the timber line.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>THE WORLD&#8217;S ONLY INLAND TEMPERATE RAINFOREST<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"page-header\" class=\"header-style-light\" data-imgready=\"true\">\n<div class=\"remove-menu-padding remove-menu-padding-mobile header-wrapper header-uncode-block\">\n<div id=\"row-unique-1\" class=\"vc_row style-color-xsdn-bg row-container\" data-parent=\"true\" data-section=\"1\">\n<div class=\"row triple-top-padding single-bottom-padding single-h-padding full-width row-parent row-header\" data-imgready=\"true\">\n<div class=\"wpb_row row-inner\">\n<div class=\"wpb_column pos-top pos-center align_left column_parent col-lg-6 single-internal-gutter\">\n<div class=\"uncol style-light\">\n<div class=\"uncoltable\">\n<div class=\"uncell no-block-padding\">\n<div class=\"uncont\">\n<div class=\"uncode-single-media text-left\">\n<div class=\"single-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"tmb tmb-light tmb-img-ratio tmb-media-first tmb-media-last tmb-content-overlay tmb-no-bg\">\n<div class=\"t-inside\">\n<div class=\"t-entry-visual\">\n<div class=\"t-entry-visual-tc\">\n<div class=\"uncode-single-media-wrapper\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"async-blurred wp-image-28715 async-done\" src=\"https:\/\/kootenaymountainculture.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/kootenay_inland_temperate_rainforest.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"791\" height=\"528\" data-uniqueid=\"28715-159135\" data-guid=\"https:\/\/kootenaymountainculture.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/kootenay_inland_temperate_rainforest.jpg\" data-path=\"kootenay_inland_temperate_rainforest.jpg\" data-width=\"1170\" data-height=\"781\" data-singlew=\"6\" data-singleh=\"4\" data-crop=\"1\" data-fixed=\"\" \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Incommappleux Valley cedars, BC.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<article id=\"post-28714\" class=\"page-body style-light-bg post-28714 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-climate category-culture category-environment category-issues tag-british-columbia tag-canada tag-east-kootenay tag-east-kootenays tag-inland-temperate-rainforest tag-kmc-41-the-180-issue tag-kootenay tag-kootenays tag-west-kootenay tag-west-kootenays\">\n<div class=\"post-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"post-body\">\n<div class=\"post-content un-no-sidebar-layout\">\n<div id=\"row-unique-2\" class=\"vc_row row-container\" data-parent=\"true\" data-section=\"2\">\n<div class=\"row limit-width row-parent\" data-imgready=\"true\">\n<div class=\"wpb_row row-inner\">\n<div class=\"wpb_column pos-top pos-center align_left column_parent col-lg-12 single-internal-gutter\">\n<div class=\"uncol style-light\">\n<div class=\"uncoltable\">\n<div class=\"uncell\">\n<div class=\"uncont no-block-padding col-custom-width\">\n<div class=\"uncode_text_column\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Kootenays are home to the world&#8217;s only inland temperate rainforest, and its uniqueness attracts everyone from tree huggers to tree cutters. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A Kootenay old-growth forest has an unmistakable vibe. It feels moist, even in the summer, with soft, spongy moss creeping over the rocks and curtains of lichen dangling from nearly every bough. Massive cedar and hemlock trees \u2014 hundreds if not thousands of years old \u2014 stand sentry over the lush under storey, where devil\u2019s club grows nine feet tall and grizzly bear, mountain caribou, cougar, wolf, and lynx still roam.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Scientists know this landscape as an inland temperate rainforest, and the Kootenays have the only one in the world. As the Valhalla Wilderness Society, an organization that\u2019s been working to protect this rare ecosystem for decades, explains it, a rainforest is loosely defined as a forest that stays wet all year. In the Earth\u2019s temperate zone \u2014 the area between the tropics and the polar regions \u2014 that typically only happens on the coast, like in British Columbia\u2019s Great Bear Rainforest or on Vancouver Island. But in the Kootenays, we have a temperate rainforest growing 400 to 600 kilometres (250 to 375 miles) from the ocean, which is why it is labelled \u201cinland.\u201d \u201cSnow forest might be a better name for it,\u201d says Eddie Petryshen, a conservation specialist at Wildsight in Kimberley, British Columbia. \u201cMost of the moisture comes from snow, not rain.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Primeval: Enter the Incomappleux\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/oG_yJmKQHak?feature=oembed&amp;width=840&amp;height=1000&amp;discover=1\" width=\"840\" height=\"473\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The North American Inland Temperate Rainforest, as it\u2019s known, used to cover 40 million acres, forming a broad arc that blanketed the entire Kootenay region before dipping south into parts of Washington, Idaho, and Montana. Today, due to logging and development, British Columbia\u2019s portion exists in much smaller fragments \u2014 some of which are mere remnants, especially in the southern Selkirk and Purcell Mountains, like the 2.6-kilometre (1.6-mile) out-and-back Old Growth Recreation Trail at Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park, near Nelson, British Columbia. A 2021 study titled Red-Listed Ecosystem Status of Interior Wetbelt and Inland Temperate Rainforest of British Columbia, Canada, published in Land journal, classified this rainforest as \u201ccritically endangered\u201d and stated that ecosystem collapse is imminent in nine to 18 years if logging rates continue at current levels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In places like Revelstoke, British Columbia, where there are still large tracts of undisturbed inland temperate rainforest, like the Argonaut and Bigmouth Valleys, residents are rallying for the clear-cutting to stop before it\u2019s too late. \u201cWe have something really, really special here,\u201d says Sarah Newton, a Revelstoke resident and spokesperson for Old Growth Revylution, an environmental conservation organization. \u201cWe\u2019re the only inland temperate rainforest left in the world that\u2019s still somewhat intact.\u201d By late summer 2021, old-growth logging protestors in Revelstoke had swelled to 200 strong and established a full-time blockade on a logging road 120 kilometres (75 miles) north of town to protect the rainforest and beyond. Last October, forest defenders were buoyed when the provincial government announced its intention to defer logging in 2.6 million hectares of at-risk old-growth pending discussions with local Indigenous Peoples. Thirteen of the 14 cutblocks that Old Growth Revylution hoped to protect were included in that deferral. As for that last cutblock, which sits at the confluence of Argonaut and Bigmouth Creeks, Newton and her colleagues are still out there blockading. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to budge,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten that dire \u2014 every cutblock counts.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">June 28, 2022\u00a0KOOTENAY MOUNTAIN CULTURE Magazine<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">By Jayme Moye, Photographs by Steve Ogle\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Jayme Moye is an award-winning writer who specializes in stories about travel, mountain sports and culture, and pushing the limits of human potential.
