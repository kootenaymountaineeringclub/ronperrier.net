It\u2019s not surprising that Sala wants to talk about the smoke, or about whales. Their poop, however, is an unexpected twist. According to Sala, whale excrement, or, more precisely, the lack of it, has a role to play in the choking miasma that has forced my interview with one of the world\u2019s foremost ocean explorers indoors instead of out on a boat.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"904cb544-b223-4640-9cbb-2ab540ba21b8\" class=\"component-container component-layout  emf_text emf-layout-top-default  emf-layout-width-wide     \">\n<div id=\"ts_2e38b8d8-c0d4-4ee2-b4b1-8a009644b8eb\" class=\"component emf_texteditor emf-paragraph readAlong\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">It may seem like a stretch, the kind that relegates environmentalists deep into woo-woo territory, but as our conversation unfolds, it starts making sense. Whale poop fertilizes ocean plankton. The plankton reproduces rapidly, absorbing carbon dioxide as it photosynthesizes sunlight. Eventually it sinks to the seafloor, trapping the planet-warming gas in layers of sediment. Fewer whales means less plankton sequestering CO2, leaving more in the atmosphere. That means more of the heat driving the wildfires that have smoked out much of North America.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"f959b1a6-1395-495d-837e-8d5866f5035c\" class=\"component-container component-layout  emf_text emf-layout-top-default  emf-layout-width-wide     \">\n<div id=\"ts_882b6843-a5c6-4761-b8b7-7444f696696b\" class=\"component emf_texteditor emf-paragraph readAlong\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\u201cSuddenly, we\u2019re seeing that the impacts of climate change are not something that is going to be suffered by somebody else,\u201d says Sala. \u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201d And so it is, in the wildfires, heat waves, and floods that have made the weather of summer 2023 some of the most extreme on record. Greater biodiversity, whether it is found in the ocean\u2019s whale populations or the old-growth forests that also store carbon, can help mitigate the effect of burning fossil fuels much more cheaply than any new technology, he says. \u201cThe more nature we have, the more nature will be able to absorb our impacts.\u201d<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"bafb3354-d01b-408b-acea-c7d200a177ec\" class=\"component-container component-layout  emf_text emf-layout-top-default  emf-layout-width-wide     \">\n<div id=\"ts_f4485708-c1e0-419e-b5c8-f3aa781cf20d\" class=\"component emf_texteditor emf-paragraph readAlong\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Sala\u2019s links between healthy ocean ecosystems and human benefits like carbon sequestration are backed up by science that he has either committed to memory or conducted himself. But it\u2019s the ability to break scientific complexity into simple concepts that even landlubbers can comprehend that makes him so effective as an ocean advocate, helping rally global governments to commit to protecting 30% of their coastlines and ocean territories by 2030. His Pristine Seas project, sponsored by the National Geographic Society, has identified dozens of the ocean\u2019s most biodiverse hot spots in an effort to call for their protection. Already he has managed to get 2.5 million sq. mi. (6.5 million sq km) of coastline and ocean set aside in 26 marine protected areas (MPAs)\u2014an expanse twice the size of India\u2014where fishing, dumping, mining, and other destructive industries are prohibited.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"ac344b19-f0ce-4140-ac91-8a415f174957\" class=\"component-container component-layout  emf_text emf-layout-top-default  emf-layout-width-wide     \">\n<div id=\"ts_c7e899a2-c061-4e98-9317-8066c6fe2fe1\" class=\"component emf_texteditor emf-paragraph readAlong\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">On May 24, Pristine Seas\u2019 scientific-research ship the\u00a0E\/V Argo\u00a0lifted anchor for its most ambitious undertaking yet: a five-year expedition to the remote tropical Pacific, where Sala plans not only to chart the world\u2019s biggest ocean from its unplumbed depths to its more familiar shores, but also to document the complex links between marine ecosystems and the lives they support on land in order to build a case for their conservation.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"a51eb0ac-324e-4816-b0ab-a5a64909b1b9\" class=\"component-container component-layout  emf_text emf-layout-top-default  emf-layout-width-wide     \">\n<div id=\"ts_abde2d68-08ac-46fe-a2b7-11d3027493ed\" class=\"component emf_texteditor emf-paragraph readAlong\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The ocean needs that help more than ever. The morning of our meeting, the European climate-monitoring agency reported that May 2023 had seen the highest ocean temperatures on record, increasing ocean acidity, weakening marine ecosystems, and forcing coral polyps to expel their colorful symbiotic zooxanthellae algae in a near-death phenomenon called bleaching. By the end of July, waters off the coast of Florida had reached Jacuzzi temperatures, and volunteers were racing to transfer fragile coral sprouts to indoor aquariums before they cooked to death. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), about 40% of the world\u2019s oceans are currently experiencing a marine heat wave, with as much as 50% forecast for September.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"903e50ad-ae7b-4fd5-89ad-38936ad20087\" class=\"component-container component-layout  emf_text emf-layout-top-default  emf-layout-width-wide     \">\n<div id=\"ts_d171f682-f383-4f6b-8e99-c669227329d2\" class=\"component emf_texteditor emf-paragraph readAlong\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The ocean has already absorbed more than 90% of the planet\u2019s greenhouse-gas-fueled warming, explains Sala, \u201cbut it will not be able to absorb our impacts for much longer without serious consequences.\u201d<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"2c35cd4c-434b-4462-a545-ce5834da67e8\" class=\"component-container component-layout  emf_text emf-layout-top-default  emf-layout-width-wide     \">\n<div id=\"ts_f483418d-b3c9-4fed-8634-d1aee0bccce6\" class=\"component emf_texteditor emf-paragraph readAlong\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The havoc wreaked on coral reefs destroys habitats that nurse, nourish, or shelter a quarter of all marine life, including the fish that provide critical protein and income to a billion people around the world. Goods and services provided by reefs in the form of tourism, shoreline protection, food, and fisheries are valued at $2.7 trillion a year. The economic consequences of reef loss are grim and looming ever closer, says Sala. A 2\u00b0C or higher rise in average global temperatures since humans started burning fossil fuels for energy would be enough to wipe out an estimated 99% of existing coral reefs. The month of July already averaged 1.5\u00b0C. \u201cI find that I am rarely invited back to dinner parties,\u201d he deadpans.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"ad355334-4234-46c8-a81a-64ce95abddb3\" class=\"component-container component-layout emf_text emf-layout-top-default emf-layout-width-medium\">\n<div id=\"ts_f585e193-b48b-492d-8a02-693bc5c86439\" class=\"component emf_texteditor emf-quote readAlong\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"dd549b5d-1670-4c03-8335-1ac716963c05\" class=\"component-container component-layout emf_text emf-layout-top-el emf-layout-width-medium\">\n<div id=\"ts_b8d9b61a-9d2b-451f-8c47-e9610f405af2\" class=\"component emf_texteditor emf-custom3 readAlong\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"4a1fed0e-9030-4357-a4af-2f5894c99a9c\" class=\"component-container component-layout  emf_text emf-layout-top-default  emf-layout-width-wide     \">\n<div id=\"ts_1c04c227-1373-438f-ab7c-471a9046a386\" class=\"component emf_texteditor emf-paragraph readAlong\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Still, says Sala, there is hope. His research has proved again and again that given the space to recover undisturbed from human exploitation, nature can bounce back. \u201cA marine protected area cannot make that water cooler, cannot protect from warming, but what we know is that fully protected areas are more resilient.\u201d He has watched pristine reef systems, bleached white by marine heat waves, recover within five years\u2014but only when they have their full cohort of predators like sharks, along with the smaller inhabitants they prey upon. A reef, he says, isn\u2019t just made up of coral. It is a delicately balanced ecosystem that includes bacteria, algae, plants, clams, crabs, urchins, herbivores, and the carnivores that keep them all in check. Take one element out, and the entire system becomes unstable. \u201cYou board a plane, and the pilot informs you that five screws are missing, but you don\u2019t know from where.

Left alone, the resulting abundance will eventually spill over into unprotected zones, stocking new areas with fish that can be harvested for human consumption, while allowing for the evolution of genetic adaptation to a changing climate. MPAs, says Sala, are like an interest-bearing savings account. As long as you don\u2019t touch the principal, you can live off the interest. \u201cThe only way to get more from the ocean is to have more life in the ocean,\u201d says Sala. \u201cAnd the only way to have more marine life is to set some places aside so it can thrive.

A chance scuba lesson in the Medes Islands marine park, one of Spain\u2019s first MPAs, taught him that the Mediterranean could be just as much an underwater wonderland when it was protected from the region\u2019s industrial fishing fleets. \u201cEverything that was missing from the sea of my childhood was there,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThe grouper, the sea bass, the scorpion fish, octopus, sea bream.\u201d<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"642a37c6-0c32-4585-9ead-0aa37cd0235e\" class=\"component-container component-layout  emf_text emf-layout-top-default  emf-layout-width-wide     \">\n<div id=\"ts_69ed2cdb-ee22-4f33-bfb8-68ed51a3fa0a\" class=\"component emf_texteditor emf-paragraph readAlong\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">That epiphany sparked an interest in marine conservation, and, with a Ph.D. in ecology, he went on to help establish the Center for Marine Biodiversity and Conservation in 2000 at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, in La Jolla, Calif. But despite his tenured position, generous research grants, and the opportunity to work with the best ocean scientists in the world, he felt something was missing. \u201cThe places that I was studying were falling under the force of the relentless human sledgehammer,\u201d he wrote in his 2020 memoir,\u00a0The Nature of Nature: Why We Need the Wild.\u00a0\u201cCorals and seagrasses were dying everywhere, and fish were being taken out of the water faster than they could reproduce. Lush underwater gardens full of large animals were being turned into dead reefs overgrown by brown algae and murky jellyfish dystopias . . . I realized that all I was doing was writing the obituary of ocean life.\u201d He felt, he says, like a doctor telling his patient how they would die, without offering a cure.

Sala wondered if the same could be done for the oceans. In 2007, Sala approached the National Geographic Society with a proposal to combine exploration, research, policy, and documentary film to build a case for local governments to establish national marine protected areas. He envisioned Pristine Seas as a kind of scientific SWAT team, refining our understanding of ocean life, by sending divers, submersibles, and cameras into waters previously unplumbed by research, and working with economists, ecologists, and climate scientists to calculate the value of preserving what they found.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"e5204d31-75b0-4a24-a726-ed3b91f621fd\" class=\"component-container component-layout  emf_image emf-layout-top-default  emf-layout-width-medium     \">\n<div class=\"emags_image_container\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"lightDarkMode component image-component swiper-lazy animated fadeIn swiper-lazy-loaded\" src=\"https:\/\/assets.emagazines.com\/time\/20230825\/GQL4UGE26OJOP3I5OS63HWLO7I.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-elem=\"pinchzoomer\" \/><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"975a7cc7-eae5-4dd9-bd6c-b793cabe7a97\" class=\"component-container component-layout  emf_text emf-layout-top-default  emf-layout-width-wide     \">\n<div id=\"ts_95d5944f-af2f-43d8-97b9-94655a3d9b55\" class=\"component emf_texteditor emf-paragraph readAlong\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Since 2008, the program has conducted 38 expeditions, produced 30 documentaries, and published more than 250 peer-reviewed studies that have upended long-held assumptions about marine ecosystems, including the power of highly protected areas to rapidly restore depleted fish, coral reefs, and kelp forests in adjacent waters. In a 2021 paper for\u00a0Nature,\u00a0Sala demonstrated that protecting 30% of the ocean would also deliver benefits for commercial fisheries and carbon sequestration. He identified key areas that, if protected, would provide the most benefit in terms of nature conservation, food production, and climate mitigation, a kind of more-bang-for-your-protection-buck checklist that he is now trying to persuade local governments to implement. Overall, Pristine Seas has helped midwife a total of 26 MPAs into existence, raising the percentage of protected ocean from 1% to 8%.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"146ac971-2cda-4b61-b9d5-110d3c753016\" class=\"component-container component-layout  emf_text emf-layout-top-default  emf-layout-width-wide     \">\n<div id=\"ts_f7a228ab-b8d9-47ea-b5fb-dbf0ad7406d6\" class=\"component emf_texteditor emf-paragraph readAlong\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">That\u2019s still significantly less than the 30% that scientists say is necessary to protect ocean biodiversity.

A marine heat wave triggered coral bleaching in more than half the reef. Sala thought he was witnessing the destruction of one of the ocean\u2019s last intact coral colonies. But a return visit in 2022 demonstrated a \u201cmiraculous\u201d recovery.

Sala wanted to understand why those coral survived the heat, when so many other reefs did not, and how that recovery could be replicated elsewhere. Sala theorized that small grazing fish had kept the bleached coral free of the brown algae that usually takes over, enabling the coral polyps to regain their zooxanthellae and start growing again. In June, Pristine Seas returned to the area in one of the first stops of its new Pacific expedition, in part to test Sala\u2019s hypothesis. Was it the presence of large numbers of fish? Or because larvae from other, less affected corals were able to take root among the ruins? Had the surviving corals evolved some sort of heat resistance? \u201cIf we believe that high protection is a key ingredient for coral resilience, we need the data,\u201d he says.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"3f80425b-e478-4a57-9245-deb9a5c11ce4\" class=\"component-container component-layout  emf_text emf-layout-top-default  emf-layout-width-wide     \">\n<div id=\"ts_c6adc07c-ea89-4e32-b993-a14915f13dc1\" class=\"component emf_texteditor emf-paragraph readAlong\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">One of the most effective components of Sala\u2019s Pristine Seas expeditions is the opportunity to offer a front-row seat for the ocean\u2019s underwater marvels to the people who can make a difference. \u201cWe take Presidents, Ministers with us.

After going out with Pristine Seas in 2022, then Colombian President Iv\u00e1n Duque more than doubled the country\u2019s marine protected areas, bringing it within reach of the 30% goal, and joining forces with regional neighbors Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Panama to establish the largest protected marine zone in the western hemisphere, if not the world.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"b859cf4b-e45c-4d8c-8a2c-96451d854821\" class=\"component-container component-layout emf_text emf-layout-top-default emf-layout-width-medium\">\n<div id=\"ts_bfa831d1-53c7-4b50-bd79-7ce014e5c203\" class=\"component emf_texteditor emf-quote readAlong\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"12720a2f-2269-4e65-99f6-7115e4ca4dca\" class=\"component-container component-layout emf_text emf-layout-top-el emf-layout-width-medium\">\n<div id=\"ts_cd1c63ad-158f-41e9-b807-e37694a2f892\" class=\"component emf_texteditor emf-custom3 readAlong\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"2ff26a55-9cc9-423f-a666-10bf86ed8a1f\" class=\"component-container component-layout  emf_text emf-layout-top-default  emf-layout-width-wide     \">\n<div id=\"ts_c6c2b368-c7ee-4de1-8af8-4b40181fc7c0\" class=\"component emf_texteditor emf-paragraph readAlong\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">It is this combination of action-oriented research and passionate advocacy that has enabled Sala to be so effective, says Jennifer Jacquet, a fisheries researcher and visiting professor of environmental science at the University of Miami, who has co-authored papers with Sala. \u201cHe is someone who understands that advances in science are incremental, and that actually the most urgent problems are social ones that require politics and policies and advocacy, things that many scientists don\u2019t feel comfortable with.\u201d<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"c8c084f5-6de2-42e6-a19d-4a57a16a5bcd\" class=\"component-container component-layout  emf_text emf-layout-top-default  emf-layout-width-wide     \">\n<div id=\"ts_5674d3e4-4d2a-4c3e-8bf1-c586c8a6b168\" class=\"component emf_texteditor emf-paragraph readAlong\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Equally at ease slipping into a wet suit on the deck of the\u00a0E\/V Argo\u00a0as he is networking in a shirt and tie at Davos, Sala has a passion that is infectious\u2014and incredibly effective at captivating the people who have the most power to protect our oceans: government leaders. Jane Lubchenco, a marine ecologist who led NOAA from 2009 to 2013, and a co-author on the\u00a0Nature\u00a0MPA paper, recalls watching him present his early findings to a panel of Norwegian lawmakers in 2018 to help rally support for a global commitment to protect 30% of the ocean by 2030. Going in, says Lubchenco, \u201cthey were dead set against it,\u201d convinced that MPAs would harm the country\u2019s lucrative fishing industry. But as Sala spoke, \u201cyou could feel the tone of the room change,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore they had been told that they had to choose between fisheries and biodiversity, or between climate-change benefits and food security.

Lots of fish, including very large groupers, starfish, and shrimp, and lots of lobsters.
