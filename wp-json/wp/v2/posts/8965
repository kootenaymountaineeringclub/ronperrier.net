Driving over Grey Creek Pass on the power line access road brought us to Redding Creek Road at the red emergency building of Crestbrook Forest Company. Snowcrest Mt can be clearly seen from this point. At 32.5 km on the Redding Creek logging road, a branch road led up a side creek for five km into a beautiful creek basin. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">After using my one wood to drive a golf ball out into the forest to later confuse an unsuspecting logger, Janice and I set off for the head of the basin above us. <\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Very little brush and 45 minutes and we were above the timber line. We ascended the crest of the long southwest ridge to the summit. They were one or two interesting scramble pitches. The time from the truck to summit was five hours. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Sorry Bob Dean, but there were two large cairns and several records of previous parties. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Instead of following the crest of the approach route back, we skirted along the obvious benches on the northwest side of the ridge. In two hours and fifteen minutes, we were at the truck. Driving time back to Grey Creek was two hours. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">This proved to be a very pleasant and scenic trip and would be suitable for a club day trip in the easy-to-moderate category. Be sure to bring your nine iron because I&#8217;m positive there is a large log between the ball and the approach shot to the green (note, this is not a free drop area).<br \/>\nHowie Ridge\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SNOWCREST MT\u00a0 2865m\u00a0 9,400&#8242; by Howie Ridge\u00a0 For many years, Bob Dean has been trying to encourage me (or anyone else) to go with him to Snowcrest Mt, at 9,400 ft the highest in the Purcells south of the Leaning &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2017\/12\/16\/snowcrest-mountain\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-8965","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-uncategorized"],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p2Ncip-2kB","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8965","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8965"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8965\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":20491,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8965\/revisions\/20491"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8965"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8965"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8965"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
