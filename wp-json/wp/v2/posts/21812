Drought? Overpopulation? Whatever happened to the Maya remains a mystery\u2014with clues hidden in the jungle.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">At its height, during the Late Classic period (A.D. 600-900), the Maya civilization formed a constellation of kingdoms and cities that stretched across the Yucatan Peninsula and Central America, almost 125,000 square miles. Scholars estimate that there were as many as 40 Maya cities. <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The most important urban centers were Uxmal, Palenque, Chiche\u0301n Itza\u0301, Tikal, Copa\u0301n, and Calakmul. Built during the Classic period (A.D. 200-900), the Maya\u2019s soaring pyramid temples and grand buildings\u2014believed by some to be palaces\u2014were richly decorated with sacred art dedicated to the gods.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Over two centuries, major cities emptied, with their grand temples abandoned and vivid artworks unfinished. Much like its ending, the exact beginning of <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Maya culture<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> has been difficult to pin down. Many scholars believe it first coalesced sometime between 7000 B.C. and 2000 B.C. after hunter-gatherers from South America moved into Mesoamerica and settled there. Sometime around 4000 B.C., cultivation of corn, their staple crop, exploded, allowing Maya culture to flourish and expand.<\/span><br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\nThe Maya did not rule as a unified empire. Rather, this was a shared society. Power struggles did occur, but they were fought by rival city-states or local <i>ajaws<\/i>, or rulers. Cancu\u0301n occupied a strategic position on the region\u2019s trade routes and was linked politically with the powerful Maya city of Calakmul. Numerous inscriptions have been found on monuments, but none date to later than the year 800. In this year, the city suffered a violent attack. The royal family and other members of the nobility were murdered, and their bodies dumped, complete with their emblems of power and jadeite jewelry, into three makeshift burial spaces. In the largest one, 38 bodies with signs of brutal trauma were unearthed.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/5494358f-b49b-4464-945d-c1eff5163764\/Maya15.jpg?w=600&amp;h=440\" alt=\"A panel carved in A.D. 795 shows the ajaw of Cancue\u0301n, Tajal Chan Ahk, together with a lower-ranking noble and a priest.\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"natgeo-template1-frame-1-module-1\" class=\"StackModule\">\n<div class=\"ScrollSpy_container\">\n<div class=\"Article flex ArticleBodyTile\">\n<section class=\"Article__Column Article__Column--main\">\n<article class=\"Article__Wrapper\">\n<section class=\"Article__Content\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\" style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span class=\"RichText\">A panel carved in A.D. 795 shows the ajaw of Cancue\u0301n, Tajal Chan Ahk, together with a lower-ranking noble and a priest. <\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Such violence was not unusual in the region, but this incident stands out as part of a larger pattern. In the first decades of the ninth century, a political and social crisis affected almost all Maya cities. By the end of the Classic period, Maya sculptors had stopped carving monuments, scribes had ceased recording their rulers\u2019 deeds, and workers had halted construction on palaces and temples. Cities were abandoned. What became known as the Mayan collapse was just beginning.<\/span><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><br \/>\nThe collapse\u2014a decline that spread from city to city\u2014lasted more than a hundred years. It began in the region known as Petexbatu\u0301n and crossed the lands near the Usumacinta River.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">As cities fell like dominoes, the jungle began to claw back land from the Maya civilization. Plant roots and tendrils curled through palaces, temples, and squares.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Hidden in the jungle, the remains of Maya architecture provide intriguing insights into the speed of the collapse. One of the last buildings erected in the city of Bonampak, in the Usumacinta River region, features vivid murals showing a victorious battle fought by the ajaw in the year 791, as well as a spectacular royal ceremony. But the full artwork is unfinished. Incomplete sketches are visible on the walls, as if artists had put down their tools and walked away in the middle of their work.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">An equally dramatic example was found in Yaxchila\u0301n, a city close to Bonampak. In 800, the king erected an imposing building and lavishly decorated it with sculptures. The building\u2019s lintels, stelae, and stairs were intricately carved with royal scenes and texts. Just eight years later, the work would be abandoned. The last text found on the site was written in the year 808.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><br \/>\nAt the start of the ninth century, builders began a magnificent temple in the city of Aguateca (in modern Guatemala). But in 810, construction stopped suddenly, leaving the temple half-finished. The stelae that had been smoothed ready for carving were never adorned. Palisades and defensive fortifications were built, suggesting that the people of Aguateca perceived an external threat. A few years later, the city was deserted. Whatever struck these cities hit them quickly.<\/span><\/span><\/span>The collapse had no single cause but rather a complex combination of factors, many common to individual cities. Overpopulation in Maya cities triggered this crisis by overstraining local resources. At the beginning of the ninth century, Maya civilization reached the peak of its demographic curve. Tikal, in present-day Guatemala, was the most populous of all the Maya cities and had grown to around 50,000 inhabitants. Local agriculture, even if expanded, would struggle to support the population. It\u2019s not clear how the populations redistributed themselves after abandoning the cities.<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/050c3c66-5a7b-4249-92b6-58a5b0580624\/Maya11.jpg?w=1272&amp;h=1654\" alt=\"A bust of a Maya high dignitary from circa A.D. 600-900\" width=\"466\" height=\"605\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--content-width InlineElement--desktop ImageGroup__Wrapper\" aria-label=\"Image Pair\">\n<div class=\"ImageGroup__Images\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"CenterCropFrame\">\n<div class=\"CenterCropFrame__Frame\">\n<div class=\"CenterCropFrame__Child-Wrap\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure id=\"561ac241-d46a-42e3-a4ca-e196abeb6007_1\" class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent\">\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<p aria-hidden=\"false\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/b9acfd11-a784-4390-95de-da6f994b3a1e\/Maya5.jpg?w=1272&amp;h=1380\" alt=\"A figurine of a Maya dignitary from the late classic period, A.D. 600 to 900\" width=\"465\" height=\"504\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"Caption__Title\" aria-hidden=\"false\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Drought may have led to the collapse. Around the ninth century, a prolonged water shortage occurred in some regions of the Maya lowlands, leading to crop losses and localized famines. Food shortages challenged the Maya leaders\u2019 control of the region. Perhaps people fled to search for more fertile lands, or maybe they rebelled against their ajaws.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Armed conflict stemming from power struggles caused fighting that blocked roads and trade routes so that goods could not be moved around quickly, leading to shortages, economic collapse, and mass population migrations. In the ninth century, texts allude to warfare between cities. Various carved panels show ajaws holding enemies captive. The names of these defeated rulers are carved on their legs and tunics.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--content-width InlineElement--desktop ImageGroup__Wrapper\" aria-label=\"Image Pair\">\n<div class=\"ImageGroup__Images\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure id=\"c73c24fa-5361-4e0a-b1c1-c69012459c35_0\" class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent\">\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/53683262-942f-40bc-b9d8-c8ba8740616a\/Maya6.jpg?w=1272&amp;h=3030\" alt=\"Stela 12, a block of stone with a scene carved into it\" width=\"421\" height=\"1002\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/span><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"CenterCropFrame\">\n<div class=\"CenterCropFrame__Frame\">\n<div class=\"CenterCropFrame__Child-Wrap\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure id=\"c73c24fa-5361-4e0a-b1c1-c69012459c35_1\" class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/a5b5d176-6114-4e0d-9dfc-ee9f916902c1\/Maya16.jpg?w=1272&amp;h=2672\" alt=\"A 1986 drawing of stela 12 by Linda Schele\" width=\"425\" height=\"893\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/span><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\" style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span class=\"RichText\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Known as stela 12, the stone on the left and a drawing of the carving on the right, a monolith from the Classic Maya period depicts the humiliation of captives after a battle fought between the city of Piedras Negras (in modern Guatemala) and the city of Pomona\u0301 in spring.<\/span>\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Even more of an enigma, a century and a half later, Maya cities in the northern areas of the Yucatan Peninsula experienced a collapse that seemed to mirror the first. The city of Uxmal during the 10th century had become the main center of power in the Puuc region. An enormous palace served as both a royal residence where the nobility held councils. There was also a ball court, and a ceremonial complex called the Nunnery Quadrangle. The reliefs, paintings, and inscriptions from this period evoke scenes of war, with warriors decked out in full battle regalia and prisoners being sacrificed.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Uxmal faced a dramatic decline in the 11th century. Construction on several monumental works was never completed. The immediate cause of this crisis appears to have been the expansion of the neighbouring city of Chiche\u0301n Itza\u0301. In parallel, the eastern region of Puuc became increasingly depopulated until it was totally abandoned by the beginning of the 11th century.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">This collapse meant the end of a political and economic system and the abandonment of cities across the southern lowlands. The cities of the northern lowlands also were abandoned 150 years later.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br \/>\nThe Maya civilization never recovered, at least in the form it had once known. However, the descendants of Maya nobles, priests, warriors, and farmers today inhabit the same lands as their ancestors and perpetuate their culture in the still-spoken Indigenous languages and religious rituals. Ancestral farming practices have not been forgotten, nor have traditional styles of clothes and jewelry. Although the Maya collapse seemed to spell the end for the Maya civilization, Maya culture continues to thrive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/e6895bbe-197a-4bfd-8446-c5a64097ad4a\/Maya13.jpg?w=1272&amp;h=808\" alt=\"An illustration of Aguateca as it may have appeared in the eighth century\" width=\"587\" height=\"373\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">An illustration of Aguateca as it may have appeared in the eighth century The twin cities of Dos Pilas and Aguateca stood on a high plateau above Lake Petexbatu\u0301n (modern Pete\u0301n, Guatemala). To augment their natural defences, the cities were fortified to prevent enemy attacks. Stockades protected the temples, palaces, fields, and the water supply. Despite these precautions, Aguateca was attacked in 790, the date on its last known stela.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<\/article>\n<\/section>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 16px;\">PALENQUE<\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">\u00a0ruins consist of 500 buildings spread over 15 square km, but only a few have been excavated.

Although the Mesoamerican calendar did not originate with the Maya, their subsequent extensions and refinements of it were the most sophisticated.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The Maya calendar consists of several cycles or counts of different lengths. The 260-day count is known as the <\/span><strong style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Tzolkin<\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">, or Tzolk\u2019in. The Tzolkin was combined with a 365-day vague solar year known as the\u00a0<\/span><strong style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Haab\u2019<\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">\u00a0to form a synchronized cycle lasting for 52 Haab\u2019, called the\u00a0<\/span><strong style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Calendar Round<\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">. Smaller cycles of 13 days, the trecena, and 20 days, the veintena, were important components of both cycles. The Calendar Round is still in use by many groups in the Guatemalan highlands.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">A different calendar was used to track longer periods. This is the <\/span><strong style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Long Count<\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">. It is a count of days since a mythological starting point &#8211; August 11, 3114 BCE in the proleptic Gregorian calendar or 6 September in the Julian calendar. By its linear nature, the Long Count extended to any date far into the past or future. This calendar involved a positional notation system, in which each position signified an increasing multiple of the number of days. The Maya numeral system was essentially <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">vigesimal<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"> (i.e., base-20), and each unit of a given position represented 20 times the unit that preceded it. An important exception was made for the second-order place value, which instead represented 18 \u00d7 20, or 360 days, more closely approximating the solar year than would 20 \u00d7 20 = 400 days.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Many Maya Long Count inscriptions contain a supplementary series, which provides information on the lunar phase, the number of the current lunation in a series of six and which of the nine Lords of the Night rules.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">A 584-day Venus cycle was also maintained, which tracked the heliacal risings of Venus as the morning and evening stars. Many events in this cycle were seen as astrologically inauspicious and baleful, and occasionally warfare was astrologically timed to coincide with stages in this cycle.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">With the development of the place-notational Long Count calendar, the Maya had an elegant system with which events could be recorded in a linear relationship to one another, and to the calendar (\u201clinear time\u201d) itself. In theory, this system could readily be extended to delineate any length of time desired, by simply adding to the number of higher-order place markers used (and thereby generating an ever-increasing sequence of day-multiples, each day in the sequence uniquely identified by its Long Count number). In practice, most Maya Long Count inscriptions confine themselves to noting only the first five coefficients in this system (a b\u2019ak\u2019tun-count), since this was more than adequate to express any historical or current date (20 b\u2019ak\u2019tuns cover 7,885 solar years). Even so, example inscriptions exist which noted or implied lengthier sequences, indicating that the Maya well understood a linear (past-present-future) conception of time.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">However, and in common with other Mesoamerican societies, the repetition of the various calendric cycles, the natural cycles of observable phenomena, and the recurrence and renewal of death-rebirth imagery in their mythological traditions were important influences upon Maya societies. This conceptual view, in which the \u201ccyclical nature\u201d of time is highlighted, was a pre-eminent one, and many rituals were concerned with the completion and re-occurrences of various cycles. As the particular calendric configurations were once again repeated, so too were the \u201csupernatural\u201d influences with which they were associated. Thus it was held that particular calendar configurations had a specific \u201ccharacter\u201d to them, which would influence events on days exhibiting that configuration. Divinations could then be made from the auguries associated with a certain configuration since events taking place on some future date would be subject to the same influences as their corresponding previous cycle dates. Events and ceremonies would be timed to coincide with auspicious dates and avoid inauspicious ones.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The completion of significant calendar cycles (\u201cperiod endings\u201d), such as a k\u2019atun-cycle, were often marked by the erection and dedication of specific monuments (mostly stela inscriptions, but sometimes twin-pyramid complexes such as those in Tikal and Yaxha), commemorating the completion, accompanied by dedicatory ceremonies.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A cyclical interpretation is also noted in Maya creation accounts, in which the present world and the humans in it were preceded by other worlds (one to five others, depending on the tradition) that were fashioned in various forms by the gods, but subsequently destroyed. The present world also had a tenuous existence, requiring the supplication and offerings of periodic sacrifice to maintain the balance of continuing existence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Tzolk\u2019in<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The tzolk\u2019in is the name commonly employed by Mayanist researchers for the Maya Sacred Round or 260-day calendar. The word tzolk\u2019in is a neologism coined in Yucatec Maya, to mean \u201ccount of days\u201d.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The tzolk\u2019in calendar combines twenty day names with the thirteen numbers of the trecena cycle to produce 260 unique days. It is used to determine the time of religious and ceremonial events and for divination. Each successive day is numbered from 1 up to 13 and then starting again at 1. Separately from this, every day is given a name in sequence from a list of 20-day names:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Some systems started the count with 1 Imix\u2019, followed by 2 Ik\u2019, 3 Ak\u2019b\u2019al, etc. up to 13 B\u2019en. The trecena day numbers then start again at 1 while the named-day sequence continues onwards, so the next days in the sequence are 1 Ix, 2 Men, 3 K\u2019ib\u2019, 4 Kab\u2019an, 5 Etz\u2019nab\u2019, 6 Kawak, and 7 Ajaw. With all twenty named days used, these now began to repeat the cycle while the number sequence continues, so the next day after 7 Ajaw is 8 Imix\u2019. The repetition of these interlocking 13- and 20-day cycles therefore takes 260 days to complete (that is, for every possible combination of number\/named day to occur once).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Haab\u2019 <\/strong>The Haab\u2019 was the Maya solar calendar made up of eighteen months of twenty days each plus a period of five days (\u201cnameless days\u201d) at the end of the year known as Wayeb\u2019. The five days of Wayeb\u2019, were thought to be a dangerous time. During Wayeb, portals between the mortal realm and the Underworld dissolved. No boundaries prevented the ill-intending deities from causing disasters. To ward off these evil spirits, the Maya had customs and rituals they practiced during Wayeb\u2019. For example, people avoided leaving their houses and washing or combing their hair. It is estimated that the Haab\u2019 was first used around 550 BC with a starting point of the winter solstice.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Each day in the Haab\u2019 calendar was identified by a day number in the month followed by the name of the month. Day numbers began with a glyph translated as the \u201cseating of\u201d a named month, which is usually regarded as day 0 of that month, although a minority treat it as day 20 of the month preceding the named month. In the latter case, the seating of Pop is day 5 of Wayeb\u2019. For the majority, the first day of the year was 0 Pop (the seating of Pop). This was followed by 1 Pop, 2 Pop as far as 19 Pop then 0 Wo, 1 Wo and so on.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As a calendar for keeping track of the seasons, the Haab\u2019 was a bit inaccurate, since it treated the year as having exactly 365 days, and ignored the extra quarter day (approximately) in the actual tropical year. This meant that the seasons moved with respect to the calendar year by a quarter day each year so that the calendar months named after particular seasons no longer corresponded to these seasons after a few centuries. The Haab\u2019 is equivalent to the wandering 365-day year of the ancient Egyptians.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Calendar Round. <\/strong>A Calendar Round date is a date that gives both the Tzolk\u2019in and Haab\u2019. This date will repeat after 52 Haab\u2019 years or 18,980 days, a Calendar Round. For example, the current creation started on 4 Ahau 8 Kumk\u2019u. When this date recurs it is known as a Calendar Round completion.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Arithmetically, the duration of the Calendar Round can be explained in various ways. One way is to consider that the least common multiple of 260 and 365 is 18980 (73 X 260 Tzolk\u2019in days equalling 52 X 365 Haab\u2019 days). Not every possible combination of Tzolk\u2019in and Haab\u2019 can occur.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Year Bearer<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A \u201cYear Bearer\u201d is a Tzolk\u2019in day name that occurs on the first day of the Haab\u2019. If the first day of the Haab\u2019 is 0 Pop, then each 0 Pop will coincide with a Tzolk\u2019in date, for example, 1 Ik\u2019 0 Pop. Since there are twenty Tzolk\u2019in day names and the Haab\u2019 year has 365 days (20*18 + 5), the Tzolk\u2019in name for each succeeding Haab\u2019 zero day will be incremented by 5 in the cycle of day names like this: 1 Ik\u2019 0 Pop\u20282 Manik\u2019 0 Pop\u20283 Eb\u2019 0 Pop\u20284 Kab\u2019an 0 Pop\u20285 Ik\u2019 0 Pop\u2026 Only these four of the Tzolk\u2019in day names can coincide with 0 Pop, and these four are called the \u201cYear Bearers\u201d.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cYear Bearer\u201d literally translates a Mayan concept. Its importance resides in two facts. For one, the four years headed by the Year Bearers are named after them and share their characteristics; therefore, they also have their own prognostications and patron deities. Moreover, since the Year Bearers are geographically identified with boundary markers or mountains, they help define the local community.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The classic system of Year Bearers described above is found at Tikal and in the Dresden Codex. During the Late Classic period, a different set of Year Bearers was in use in Campeche. In this system, the Year Bearers were the Tzolk\u2019in that coincided with 1 Pop. These were Ak\u2019b\u2019al, Lamat, B\u2019en and Edz\u2019nab.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Example of Long Count Calendar<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The east side of stela C, Quirigua with the mythical creation date of 13 baktuns, 0 katuns, 0 tuns, 0 uinals, 0 kins, 4 Ahau 8 Cumku \u2013 August 11, 3114 BCE in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Since Calendar Round dates repeat every 18,980 days, approximately 52 solar years, the cycle repeats roughly once each lifetime, so a more refined method of dating was needed if history was to be recorded accurately. To specify dates over periods longer than 52 years, Mesoamericans used the Long Count calendar.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Maya name for a day was k\u2019in. Twenty of these k\u2019ins are known as a winal or uinal. Eighteen winals make one tun. Twenty tuns are known as a k\u2019atun. Twenty k\u2019atuns make a b\u2019ak\u2019tun.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Long Count calendar identifies a date by counting the number of days from the Mayan creation date 4 Ahaw, 8 Kumk\u2019u (August 11, 3114 BC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar or September 6 in the Julian calendar). But instead of using a base-10 (decimal) scheme like Western numbering, the Long Count days were tallied in a modified base-20 scheme. Thus 0.0.0.1.5 is equal to 25, and 0.0.0.2.0 is equal to 40. As the winal unit resets after only counting to 18, the Long Count consistently uses base-20 only if the tun is considered the primary unit of measurement, not the k\u2019in; with the k\u2019in and winal units being the number of days in the tun. The Long Count 0.0.1.0.0 represents 360 days, rather than the 400 in a purely base-20 (vigesimal) count.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There are also four rarely used higher-order cycles: piktun, kalabtun, k\u2019inchiltun, and alautun.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Since the Long Count dates are unambiguous, the Long Count was particularly well suited to use on monuments. The monumental inscriptions would include the 5 digits of the Long Count but also the two tzolk\u2019in characters followed by the two haab\u2019 characters.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Misinterpretation of the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar was the basis for a popular belief that a cataclysm would occur on December 21, 2012. December 21, 2012, was simply the day that the calendar went to the next b\u2019ak\u2019tun, at Long Count 13.0.0.0.0. The date on which the calendar will go to the next piktun (a complete series of 20 b\u2019ak\u2019tuns), at Long Count 1.0.0.0.0.0, will be on October 13, 4772.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">For the ancient Maya, it was a huge celebration to make it to the end of a whole cycle\u201d. The portrayal of December 2012 as a doomsday or cosmic-shift event is\u201d a complete fabrication and a chance for people to cash in.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica,

include a series of glyphs known as the Supplementary Series. The Supplementary Series most commonly consists of the following elements:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>1. Lords of the Night<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Each night was ruled by one of the nine lords of the underworld. This nine-day cycle was usually written as two glyphs: a glyph that referred to the Nine Lords as a group, followed by a glyph for the lord that would rule the next night.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>2. Lunar Series<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A lunar Series is written as five glyphs that provide information about the current lunation, the number of the lunation in a series of six, the current ruling lunar deity and the length of the current lunation.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>Moon age.<\/em> The Maya counted the number of days in the current lunation. They used two systems for the zero date of the lunar cycle: either the first night they could see the thin crescent moon or the first morning when they could not see the waning moon. The age of the moon was depicted by a set of glyphs that Mayanists coined glyphs D and E:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A new moon glyph was used for day zero in the lunar cycle.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">D glyphs were used for lunar ages for days 1 through 19, with the number of days that had passed from the new moon.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">For lunar ages 20 to 30, an E glyph was used, with the number of days from 20.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>Lunation number and lunar deity<\/em><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Maya counted the lunation in a cycle of six, numbered zero through 5. Each one was ruled by one of the six Lunar Deities. This was written as two glyphs: a glyph for the completed lunation in the lunar count with a coefficient of 0 through 5 and a glyph for the lunar deity that ruled the current lunation. Teeple found that Quirigua Stela E (9.17.0.0.0) is lunar deity 2 and that most other inscriptions use this same moon number. It is an interesting date because it was a k\u2019atun completion and a solar eclipse was visible in the Maya area two days later on the first unlucky day of Wayeb\u2019.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>Lunation length<\/em><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The length of the lunar month is 29.53059 days so if you count the number of days in a lunation it will be either 29 or 30 days. The Maya wrote whether the lunar month was 29 or 30 days as two glyphs: a glyph for lunation length followed by either a glyph made up of a moon glyph over a bundle with a suffix of 19 for a 29-day lunation or a moon glyph with a suffix of 10 for a 30-day lunation.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>819 day count. <\/strong>Some Mayan monuments include glyphs that record an 819-day count in their Initial Series. Each group of 819 days was associated with one of the four directions and its colour \u2014 east red, north white, west black and south yellow.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The 819-day count can be described in several ways: Most of these are referred to using a \u201cY\u201d glyph and a number. Many also have a glyph for K\u2019awill \u2014 the god with a smoking mirror in his head. K\u2019awill has been suggested as having a link to Jupiter. The accompanying texts begin with a directional glyph and a verb for 819-day-count phrases.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Short Count. <\/strong>During the late Classic period, the Maya began to use an abbreviated short count instead of the Long Count. An example of this can be found on altar 14 at Tikal. In the kingdoms of Postclassic Yucat\u00e1n, the Short Count was used instead of the Long Count. The cyclical Short Count is a count of 13 k\u2019atuns (or 260 tuns), in which each k\u2019atun was named after its concluding day, Ahau (\u2018Lord\u2019). 1 Imix was selected as the recurrent \u2018first day\u2019 of the cycle, corresponding to 1 Cipactli in the Aztec day count. The cycle was counted from katun 11 Ahau to katun 13 Ahau, with the coefficients of the katuns\u2019 concluding days running in the order 11 \u2013 9 \u2013 7 \u2013 5 \u2013 3 \u2013 1 \u2013 12 \u2013 10 \u2013 8 \u2013 6 \u2013 4 \u2013 2 \u2013 13 Ahau (since a division of 20 \u00d7 360 days by 13 falls 2 days short). The concluding day 13 Ahau was followed by the re-entering first day 1 Imix. This is the system as found in the colonial Books of Chilam Balam.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Venus cycle. <\/strong>Another important calendar for the Maya was the Venus cycle. The Maya kings had skilled astronomers who accurately calculated the Venus cycle. The Maya achieved such accuracy by careful observation over many years. Venus was often referred to as \u201cThe Morning Star\u201d and \u201cThe Evening Star\u201d because of its visibility during both times. There are various theories as to why the Venus cycle was important for the Maya. Across Mesoamerica, Venus was often depicted as \u201cdefeating\u201d the Sun and the Moon, perhaps because of its persistent visibility after transitions from day to night (and vice-versa). Most scholars agree that Venus was associated with war and that the Mayans used it to divine good times (electional astrology) for their coronations and wars.
