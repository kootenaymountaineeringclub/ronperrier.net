Its capital and largest city,\u00a0Recife, is one of the most important economic and urban hubs in the country.<br \/>\nThe contemporary state inherits its name from the\u00a0Captaincy of Pernambuco, established in 1534. The region was originally inhabited by\u00a0Tupi-Guarani-speaking peoples. European colonization began in the 16th century, under mostly\u00a0Portuguese rule\u00a0interrupted by a brief period of\u00a0Dutch rule, followed by\u00a0Brazilian independence\u00a0in 1822. Large numbers of\u00a0slaves\u00a0were brought from Africa during the colonial era to cultivate sugarcane, and a significant portion of the state&#8217;s population has some amount of African ancestry.<br \/>\nThe state has rich cultural traditions thanks to its varied history and peoples.\u00a0Brazilian Carnivals\u00a0in Recife and the historic colonial capital of\u00a0Olinda\u00a0are renowned: the\u00a0Galo da Madrugada\u00a0parade in Recife has held world records for its size.<br \/>\nHistorically a center of\u00a0sugarcane\u00a0cultivation due to the favorable climate, the state has a modern economy dominated by the\u00a0services sector\u00a0today, though large amounts of sugarcane are still grown. The coming of democracy in\u00a01985\u00a0has brought the state progress and challenges in turn: while economic and health indicators have improved,\u00a0inequality\u00a0remains high.<br \/>\n<strong>Geography.<br \/>\n<\/strong>The\u00a0Fernando de Noronha\u00a0Islands, 354 km from the mainland, form a &#8220;state district&#8221; of Pernambuco.<br \/>\nPernambuco comprises a comparatively narrow coastal zone, a high inland plateau, and an intermediate zone formed by the terraces and slopes between the two.<br \/>\nIts surface is much broken by the remains of the ancient plateau which has been worn down by erosion, leaving escarpments and ranges of flat-topped mountains, called\u00a0chapadas, capped in places by horizontal layers of sandstone.<br \/>\n<strong>Climate.<\/strong> The middle zone, called the\u00a0agreste\u00a0region, has a drier climate and lighter vegetation,\u00a0including the semi-deciduous\u00a0Pernambuco interior forests, where many trees lose their leaves in the dry season.<br \/>\nThe inland region, called the\u00a0sert\u00e3o\u00a0is high, stony, and dry, and frequently devastated by prolonged droughts (secas). The climate is characterized by hot days and cool nights. There are two clearly defined seasons, a rainy season from March to June, and a dry season for the remaining months.\u00a0The interior of the state is covered mostly by the dry thorny scrub vegetation called\u00a0caatinga. The\u00a0Rio S\u00e3o Francisco\u00a0is the main water source for this area.<br \/>\nThe climate is milder in the countryside of the state because of the\u00a0Borborema Plateau\u00a0(&#8220;Planalto da Borborema&#8221;, popularly known as &#8220;Serra das Russas&#8221; or &#8220;Russians&#8217; Mountain&#8221;). Some towns are located more than 1000 meters above sea level, and temperatures there can descend to 10\u00a0\u00b0C (50\u00a0\u00b0F) and even 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F) in some cities (i.e.,\u00a0Triunfo) during the winter.<br \/>\nThe volcanic archipelago of\u00a0Fernando de Noronha\u00a0in the Atlantic Ocean, 535\u00a0km northeast of\u00a0Recife, has been part of Pernambuco since 1988.<br \/>\nKahal Zur Israel Synagogue\u00a0in Mauritsstad (Recife), the first synagogue in the Americas<br \/>\n<strong>Demographics. <\/strong>According to a genetic study from 2013, Pernambucans have 56.8% European, 27.9% African and 15.3% Amerindian ancestries.<br \/>\nUnder Dutch rule, Jewish culture developed in\u00a0Recife. Many Jews, having fled the\u00a0Inquisition\u00a0in Iberia had sought refuge in the Netherlands. The Jewish community established themselves in Dutch Brazil and would later migrate elsewhere in the Americas.<br \/>\n<strong>Economy.<\/strong> The\u00a0service sector\u00a0is the largest component of GDP at 73.2%, followed by the\u00a0industrial sector\u00a0at 21.6%.\u00a0Agribusiness\u00a0represents 5.2% of GDP (2006). Pernambuco exports: sugar 35.6%, fruit and juice 12.6%, fish and\u00a0crustacean\u00a012.3%, electric products 11.1%,\u00a0chemicals\u00a07.1%,\u00a0woven\u00a05.6% (2002).<br \/>\nPetrolina.

The main islands are the visible parts of a range of submerged mountains, islets, and rocks. The Archipelago of Fernando de Noronha hosts ecological sites ideal for exuberant marine animal life, due to its geographic location far from the continent and well within the path of the Southern Equatorial Currents, as well as the nature of its climate.<br \/>\nPorto de Galinhas. It features warm clear water pools scattered around its coral reefs, estuaries, mangroves, coconut trees and a number of other samples of abundant nature richness making Porto de Galinhas a place not to be missed or forgotten.<br \/>\nBoa Viagem.

It is 17 km from the center but there is a metro line (4.5 BR) that gives good access. Arriving at 9:30, I decided to walk the 1.8 km to my hostel through mostly deserted streets. One square had several bars and\u00a0 many tables filled with people and music.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>The hostel (Zili Pernambuco 55 BR) is very well organized with a plethora of locked gates and padlocks.

Founded in the 16th century by the Portuguese, the town\u2019s history is linked to the sugar-cane industry.

Founded in 1535 on hillsides overlooking the Atlantic Ocean on Brazil\u2019s northeast coast, close to the isthmus of Recife where its port is situated, Olinda served from the last years of the 16th century onward as one of the most important centres of the sugarcane industry, which for almost two centuries was the mainstay of the Brazilian economy. This former capital of the Portuguese administrative division (<em>capitania<\/em>) of Pernambuco became the symbol of sugar and of the wealth it procured. Its historic centre today is marked by a number of architecturally outstanding buildings set in the lush vegetation of gardens, hedgerows and convent precincts, a mass of greenery bathed in tropical light with the sandy shore and ocean below.<br \/>\nRebuilt by the Portuguese after being looted and burned by the Dutch, Olinda\u2019s existing historic fabric dates largely from the 18th century, although it incorporates some older monuments such as the 16th-century church of\u00a0<em>S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Batista dos Militares<\/em>. Olinda became a remarkable nucleus, first as an economic, architectural and artistic centre, and later as a centre for the renewal of ideas.<br \/>\nIt is dominated by the\u00a0<em>Catedral Alto da S\u00e9<\/em>, the former Jesuit church and college (now the church of\u00a0<em>Nossa Senhora da Gra\u00e7a<\/em>), the\u00a0<em>Pal\u00e1cio Episcopal<\/em>, the\u00a0<em>Miseric\u00f3rdia<\/em>\u00a0church, the convents of the Franciscans, Carmelites and Benedictines, and various public buildings ranging from the 17th to 19th centuries. The studied refinement of the decor of these architectural works contrasts with the charming simplicity of the houses, many of which are painted in vivid colours or faced with ceramic tiles.<\/p>\n<p><em>I walked to the church Igreja Nosso Senhora do Amparo but it was closed.

The city is located at the confluence of the\u00a0Beberibe\u00a0and\u00a0Capibaribe\u00a0rivers before they flow into the\u00a0South Atlantic Ocean. It is a major port on the Atlantic. Its name is an allusion to the stone\u00a0reefs\u00a0that are present by the city&#8217;s shores. The many rivers, small islands and over 50 bridges found in Recife city centre characterise its geography and led to the city being called the &#8220;Brazilian\u00a0Venice&#8221;. Major products are those derived from\u00a0cane\u00a0(sugar and\u00a0ethanol), motor vehicles, ships, oil platforms, electronics, software, and others. With fiscal incentives by the government, many industrial companies were started in the 1970s and 1980s.<br \/>\nA combination of a large supply of\u00a0labor\u00a0and significant private investments turned Recife into Brazil&#8217;s second largest medical hub (the first being\u00a0S\u00e3o Paulo);\u00a0modern hospitals with state-of-the-art equipment receive patients from several neighbouring States.<br \/>\nRecife stands out as a major tourist attraction of the\u00a0Northeast, both for its beaches and for its historic sites, dating back to both the Portuguese and the Dutch colonization of the region.

The invaders were expelled in 1645, after intense fighting in Porto Calvo, leaving the economy in ruins.

There are numerous macei\u00f3s and lakes in this part of Brazil; because of this, the city was named Macei\u00f3, and the state, Alagoas.

Its development started with the arrival of ships taking wood from Jaragu\u00e1 bay. With the installation of the sugar mills, Macei\u00f3 started to export sugar, then tobacco, coconut, leather, and some spices.<br \/>\nThe city is located between the\u00a0Munda\u00fa Lagoon\u00a0and the Atlantic Ocean, with a tropical climate with very warm to hot temperatures and high relative humidity all throughout the year.<br \/>\nThe natural vegetation surrounding Macei\u00f3 is\u00a0tropical rainforest.<br \/>\nEconomy. One substantial local industry is based on chemical products from brine pumped from deep wells on the outskirts of Macei\u00f3. Another substantial industry is the production of ethanol and sugar from sugarcane grown in the region.
