The city straddles the Cibin River, a tributary of the river Olt. Now the capital of Sibiu County, between 1692 and 1791 and 1849\u201365 Sibiu was also the capital of the Principality of Transylvania.<br \/>\nSibiu is one of the most important cultural centres of Romania and was designated the European Capital of Culture for the year 2007, along with the city of Luxembourg. Formerly the centre of the Transylvanian Saxons, the old city of Sibiu was ranked as &#8220;Europe&#8217;s 8th-most idyllic place to live&#8221; by Forbes in 2008. The city also administers the village of P\u0103ltini\u0219, a ski resort located 35 kilometres to the south.<br \/>\n<strong>History.<\/strong> Sibiu was initially a Daco-Roman city called Cedonia. The town was refounded by the Saxons (German) settlers brought there by the king G\u00e9za II of Hungary. The first reference to the area was Cipin and Cibinium from 1191 when Pope Celestine III confirmed the existence of the free prepositure of the Saxons in Transylvania, the prepositure having its headquarters in Sibiu.<br \/>\nIn the 14th century, it was already an important trade centre. In 1376, the craftsmen were divided in 19 guilds. Sibiu became the most important ethnic German city among the seven cities that gave Transylvania its German name Siebenb\u00fcrgen (literally seven citadels). It was home to the Universitas Saxorum (Community of the Saxons), a network of pedagogues, ministers, intellectuals, city officials, and councilmen of the German community forging an ordered legal corpus and political system in Transylvania since the 1400s. In 1699, after the Ottomans withdrew to his base of power in Hungary and Transylvania, the town became capital of Principality of Transylvania (since 1570 the principality was mostly under suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire, however often had a dual vassalage). During the 18th and 19th centuries, the city became the second- and later the first-most important centre of Transylvanian Romanian ethnics. The first Romanian-owned bank had its headquarters here (The Albina Bank), as did the ASTRA (Transylvanian Association for Romanian Literature and Romanian&#8217;s People Culture). After the Romanian Orthodox Church was granted status in the Habsburg Empire from the 1860s onwards, Sibiu became the Metropolitan seat, and the city is still regarded as the third-most important centre of the Romanian Orthodox Church. Between the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and 1867 (the year of the Ausgleich), Sibiu was the meeting-place of the Transylvanian Diet, which had taken its most representative form after the Empire agreed to extend voting rights in the region.<br \/>\nAfter World War I, when Austria-Hungary was dissolved, Sibiu became part of Romania; the majority of its population was still ethnic German (until 1941) and counted a large Romanian community, as well as a smaller Hungarian one. Starting from the 1950s and until after 1990, most of the city&#8217;s ethnic Germans emigrated to Germany and Austria. Among the roughly 2,000 who have remained is Klaus Johannis, the current President of Romania.<br \/>\n<strong>Geography.<\/strong> Sibiu is situated near the geographical center of Romania set in the Cibin Depression, the city is about 20\u00a0km from the F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 Mountains, 12\u00a0km from the Cibin Mountains, and about 15\u00a0km from the Lotru Mountains, which border the depression in its southwestern section. The northern and eastern limits of Sibiu are formed by the T\u00e2rnavelor Plateau, which descends to the Cibin Valley through Gu\u0219teri\u021bei Hill.<br \/>\nThe Cibin river as well as some smaller streams runs through Sibiu. The geographical position of Sibiu makes it one of the most important transportation hubs in Romania with important roads and railway lines passing through it.<br \/>\nClimate. Sibiu&#8217;s climate is humid continental with average temperatures of 8 to 9\u00a0\u00b0C (46 to 48\u00a0\u00b0F). The average rainfall is 627 l\/m2, and there are about 120 days of hard frost annually.<br \/>\n<strong>Demographics.<\/strong> It is the 14th-largest city in Romania. The ethnic breakdown is Romanians 95.9%, Hungarians 1.6%, Germans (Transylvanian Saxons) 1.1%, Roma 0.4%. Today, most of the population is Romanian Orthodox (90%). Protestants and Roman Catholics represent about 5%.<br \/>\n<strong>Economy<\/strong>. Sibiu is an important economic hub for Romania, with a high rate of foreign investments. It is also an important hub for the manufacturing of automotive components and houses factories belonging to ThyssenKrupp Bilstein-Compa, Takata Corporation, Continental Automotive Systems, and NTN-SNR ball bearings. Other local industries are machine components, textiles, agro-industry, and electrical components (Siemens).<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Historic Centre of Sibiu and its Ensemble of Squares.<\/strong> A tentative WHS: (29\/06\/2004), the Upper Town is organised around three city squares and a set of streets along the line of the hill. The buildings are an interesting mix of styles (mostly Baroque and Gothic), colours and roof lines. The main street in the center is Str Nicolae B\u0103lceseu, wide and pedestrianized.<br \/>\n<strong>Grand Square<\/strong>, the largest square, has been the center of the city since the 15th century. At 142 meters long and 93 meters wide, it is one of the largest ones in Transylvania.<br \/>\nBrukenthal Palace, one of the most important Baroque monuments in Romania, lies on the north-western corner of the square. It was erected between 1777 and 1787 as the main residence for the Governor of Transylvania Samuel von Brukenthal. It houses the main part of the National Brukenthal Museum, opened in 1817, making it one of the oldest museums in the world. Next to the palace is the Blue House or Moringer House, an 18th-century Baroque house bearing the old coat of arms of Sibiu on its fa\u00e7ade.<br \/>\nOn the south and east sides are two- or three-storey houses, having tall attics with small windows known as the city&#8217;s eyes. Most of these houses are dated 15th to 19th centuries, and most of them are Renaissance or Baroque in style.<br \/>\n<strong>Lesser Square <\/strong>is a smaller square situated in the northern part of the Upper Town. After the 2007 rehabilitation there has been an increase in the number of small businesses such as pubs and restaurants in this area. The square is connected to the other two squares and to other streets by small, narrow passages. When I was here, there was a lovely band playing music \u2013 all wind instruments and drums.<br \/>\n<strong>Brukenthal National Museum<\/strong> (Samuel von <strong>Brukenthal Palace<\/strong>) is a museum housed in the palace of Samuel von Brukenthal, the first Habsburg governor of Transylvania. He started its first collections around 1790 and opened to the public in 1817, making it the oldest institution of its kind in Romania.<br \/>\nIt is a complex of six museums in different locations around the city. The Art Galleries are located inside the Brukenthal Palace with about 1,200 works of 15th to the 18th century European painting: Flemish-Dutch, German and Austrian, Italian, Spanish and French Schools. The Galleries also include collections of engravings, books, numismatics, and minerals. The temporary exhibition was \u201cDecade of Romanian Art\u201d.<br \/>\nThe Brukenthal Library, also inside the Brukenthal Palace, has 300,000 manuscripts, rare foreign books, old Romanian-language books, contemporary books and specialized magazines. 25 Lie<br \/>\nThe Museum of Pharmacology is located in an historical building dated 1569, where one of the oldest pharmacies in present-day Romania was located. It is the basement of this house where Samuel Hahnemann invented homeopathy.<br \/>\n<strong>Orthodox Metropolitan Cathedral<\/strong> (Holy Trinity Cathedral). This Roman Catholic parish cathedral was built between 1726-33. A single nave structure, it has lovely side chapels with polychromes. The 1901 stained glass windows were paid for by donations from local families. The apse has a nice 1777 fresco of the Holy Mother crowned by the Holy Trinity. Mass is held in three languages. Free<br \/>\n<strong>Astra National Museum Complex<\/strong>. Located 4kms west of the city center in a lovely mature forest, this open-air museum has 2 sections. Unfortunately it is poorly signed and I saw only the traditional folk house section with several log buildings with thatch or shingle roofs. The signs are poor and tell little of the origin of the homes but most were relocated here from the region. The most interesting were the church, a Roma camp and a water-wheel driven sawmill. Most were locked but you could enter the ground stone foundation sections with no furniture. The second part circles a large lake with several water and wind driven mills, municipal buildings and sheep enclosures. 25 Lie, 12 reduced and free for me today as I arrived 50 minutes before closing. I had not realized that Romania was an hour ahead of the Balkans and had the wrong time. But it is often worthwhile coming to museums just before closing \u2013 I get to enter many for free.<br \/>\nB\u00e2lea Lake Cable Car.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MARGINIMEA SIBIULUI VILLAGES\u00a0<\/strong>(Traditional villages around Sibiu). In the NM \u201csmall towns\u201d and \u201cSights\u201d series, this area has 18 Romanian villages and small towns, each with a unique ethnological, cultural, architectural, and historical heritage. The area is situated in the immediate vicinity of the cradle of Saxon Civilisation in Transylvania &#8211; the city of Sibiu, and has an area of over 200\u00a0km\u00b2 limited by the Sadu River in the south and the S\u0103li\u015fte river in the north. The villages are situated around the valleys of different rivers that flow from the Cindrel Mountains through the Transylvanian Plateau.<br \/>\nI visited the first three, the oldest of the 18.<br \/>\n<strong>R\u0103\u0219inari<\/strong>. Now this is a cute village. The pastel painted houses line the narrow streets forming a continuous line of buildings. Each house has a large, arched wood door (like a garage door but with doors in it) that gives access to parking and the house. There are at least 3 churches, one with a massive graveyard and a lovely municipal building housing the museum.<br \/>\n<strong>Orlat.<\/strong> Not nearly as cute as R\u0103sinari, the gates to the parking aren\u2019t in walls but simpler and lower iron gates.<br \/>\n<strong>T\u0103lmaciu<\/strong> (town). This is larger and has more 2-story houses. I slept here on the side of the river in a great spot.<br \/>\nThe others are: Boi\u021ba, F\u00e2nt\u00e2nele, Sibiu, Gale\u015f, Gura, R\u00e2ului, Jina, Poiana Sibiului, Poplaca, R\u00e2ul Sadului. Rod, Sadu, S\u0103li\u0219te (town), Sibiel, T\u0103lm\u0103cel, Tili\u0219ca and Vale.<br \/>\n<strong>Brief history. <\/strong>The oldest known settlement was a Saxon village called Ruetel dating to 1204 &#8211; which became R\u0103\u0219inari in 1488 -, followed by T\u0103lmaciu (1318), Orlat (1322) and S\u0103li\u0219te (1354). Throughout their history, some were fiefs of the rulers of the Romanian principality of Wallachia. An important event was the establishment in the 18th century by Maria Theresa of the 1st Romanian border regiment at Orlat. Boi\u021ba was also a border village, at the end of the passageway along the Olt River.<br \/>\n<strong>Occupations. <\/strong>The people were mainly shepherds crossing the Carpathian Mountains connecting communities to the north and south of the mountains. Activities closely related to shepherding, such as wool and leather manufacturing, are still well maintained in the area today.<\/p>\n<p>The Transalpine Highway starts in Talmaciu and runs west over the spine of the mountains.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ALBA JULIA <\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Le noyau historique de la ville d&#8217;Alba Julia.<\/strong> A tentative WHS (01\/03\/1991). <strong><br \/>\n<\/strong>The main square has several bronze status of \u201cnormal\u201d town folk and a Roman site with a lapidarium full of stone fragments.

This massive star-shaped fort with many ravelins and bastions, is full of modern buildings (including a medieval hotel and restaurants), a Roman fort and houses and several halls (Weapons, Knights, Roman Vestiges), a prison and a military camp \u2013 the north east section is visited on what they call the Three Fortifications Route. 20 lei<br \/>\n<strong>Coronation Cathedral\u00a0<\/strong>(Reunification Cathedral). Built in 1921-22 for the coronation of King Ferdinand I and Queen Mary on Oct. 22, 1922 as sovereigns of Romania, it is a Greek cross style supported by four massive marble columns. The highlights are the frescoes on the walls and mosaics in the apse. I entered during service \u2013 much chanting by the elaborately clad priests and lots of crossing and bowing by the congregation. The church is in in a large compound entered through a gate in the monstrous bell tower and surrounded by colonnaded portals.<\/p>\n<p><em>I saw Alba Julia on my second day in Romania after Sibui, continued to West Romania and returned here from the northwest part of the country. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Castle Bethlen-Halle<\/strong>r (Cetatea de Balt\u0103). Originally built in French Gothic style by Gabriel Bethlen, the Prince of Transylvania in 1615-21, it was restored in 1770-73 in Baroque style by Eugen Haller. It was used by the state for the second half of the 20<sup>th<\/sup> century and then converted into a winery. Tours are only for groups by reservation.<br \/>\nThe 3-story, square castle has large round corner towers with high peaked orange tiles roofs. Its walls average 1.25-2.4m thick.<\/p>\n<p><strong>VILLAGES WITH FORTIFIED CHURCHES IN TRANSYLVANIA<br \/>\n<\/strong>The south-eastern Transylvania region in Romania currently has one of the highest numbers of existing fortified churches from the 13th to 16th centuries. It has more than 150 well-preserved fortified churches of a great variety of architectural styles (out of an original 300 fortified churches).<br \/>\nListed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Villages with Fortified Churches in Transylvania are seven villages (six Saxon and one Sz\u00e9kely) founded by the Transylvanian Saxons. They are dominated by fortified churches and characterized by a specific settlement pattern that has been preserved since the Late Middle Ages.<br \/>\nThe seven villages listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site are Biertan, C\u00e1inic, D\u00e3rjiu, Prejmer, Saschiz, Valea Viilor and Viscri<br \/>\n<strong>History. <\/strong>The Saxon villages of Transylvania appeared in the twelfth century when the Kings of Hungary settled German colonists in the area. They had a special status and managed to survive and thrive, forming a very strong community of farmers, artisans and merchants. Being situated in a region constantly under the threat of the Ottoman and Tatar invasions, they built fortifications of different sizes. The most important towns were fully fortified, and the smaller communities created fortifications centered on the church, where they added defensive towers and storehouses to keep their most valuable goods and to help them withstand long sieges.<br \/>\n<strong>Description<\/strong>. The topography in Southern Transylvania is that of a plateau, cut by wide valleys of various small rivers that flow into larger ones, namely the Olt River, Mure\u015f River, T\u00e2rnava Mare River and T\u00e2rnava Mic\u0103 River. The villages follow the topography closely and try to make the best of it; thus villages situated in a valley developed around a central street and possibly some secondary ones, while those situated on a flatter spot follow a looser, radial pattern. Due to security reasons and the traditions of the Saxon inhabitants, the villages are compact.<br \/>\nThe main element is the church, always situated in the middle of the town. Different types of fortifications can be found: a small enceinte around the church, a row of fortifications around the church or a real fortress with multiple fortification walls centered on the church. The churches have been adapted to include defensive functions; all of them are either Romanesque basilicas or single-nave churches of the late Gothic period. The churches often include many additions, ranging in age from the original period in which the churches were built Late Middle Ages to the sixteenth century. Many churches also include baroque elements from that period, as the baroque style was very popular in the region.<br \/>\nIn almost all cases, the church is situated in an easily defendable position, generally on a hilltop. Elements of fortifications found in the main cities in the area have been adapted here, and they are a testimony of the building techniques used along the years by the Saxon community. Some fortifications had observation towers, some of them being church towers adapted to the needs of a fortress. The materials are the traditional ones, stone and red bricks, with a red clay tiled roof, a typical feature of the area.<br \/>\nClose to the church there is the main square of the village or Tanzplaz (Dance Square) to which social life gravitated. The only buildings situated next to the fortifications are those of communal use: the school or the village hall. The parish house, along with the houses of the most wealthy villagers, were situated around this square. Also in most sites, barns for grain storage are situated close to the centre of the village.<br \/>\n<strong>Biertan Fortified Church<\/strong>. Walk up a long wooden stairs inside the buttressed outer walls, covered with a wood roof, and cross through the main defensive walls. Two large towers are on the corners. One had 9 carved grave slabs, one with original paint.<br \/>\nThe church is huge with side aisles the same height as the main nave, all with rib vaulted ceilings and supported by 6 massive columns. The iconostasis is a simple gilt frame system holding 18 icons. The highlights are the intricate inlay choir stalls, simple wood bench pews, intricately carved pulpit canopy, and oak wood floors. A simple marble baptismal font is in the center of the altar area. It is light filled from all the high, clear windows made of light round panes. 10 Lei, no reduction<br \/>\nI entered as 100s disgorged from a bus.<br \/>\n<strong>Fortified Stone Church of St Stephen<\/strong>, Saschiz . This is completely different \u2013 it has no walls and is simply a 10-story square, stone tower about 20m on a side. The roof has coloured tiles and 4 small turrets around the central steep spire. It was being renovated, was covered in scaffold, had a fence around it and the storyboard could not be read. The normal parish church was next door.

At the end I came down the road.<br \/>\n<strong>Church on the Hill, Sighi\u0219oara\u00a0(Biserica Evangelical Din Deal).<\/strong> It has 3 naves, a bell tower and unusually a crypt (low, dark, brick with a domed vault ceiling, there are 60 niches, 58 of which are cemented over, one with a reliquy, and one with a bunch of wood). The original church was 13<sup>th<\/sup> century and restored in the 14<sup>th<\/sup> and 15<sup>th<\/sup> centuries. The hall dates from 1480-1500. The southern portal from 1428 has 4 statures presenting the Adoration of the Magi. Paintings date to 1380-1520. Dedicated to Saint Nicholas the church also has stone Gothic furniture and tabernacle, 1523 pews and several tombstones from 1500-1650. 8 Lei.<br \/>\nI was all alone inside. The frescoes are mostly gone and faded, but a few are still good. The wood chests are for storing food. Free<br \/>\nThen I walked down the 179 covered steps to the town square.

The walls are white plastered with a central entrance tower. There are 4 large areas on top of the walls &#8211; one is a small museum in one of the towers. It tells of the villages storing their lard and ham in the tower because it was cool all year long. They were allowed access to get their ham once a week and controls measures to ensure honesty were strict. Another room had tools (carpentry, locksmith) and a loom and spinning wheel. At the very top is an open air \u201cattic\u201d with wattle bee hives and the large wooden chests used to store food.<br \/>\nWhen I was there, a classical trio was playing to a packed audience in the quaint small church, plain except for the faux-marble wood fronting the balcony.

The Ottomans controlled it in 1541, but returned it to the Brasov community in 1651 but reverted to the Hapsburgs in 1691. It ceased being a customs point in 1836. From 1920-37, it was a royal residence and home to Queen Marie (encouraged Romania to join the Allies in WW I) who renovated it completely and the home of Princess Ilena (married to Anton Hapsburg, the Archduke of Austria and their 6 children from 1944-48.
