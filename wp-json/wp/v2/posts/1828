Formed when the Solimoes, Negro and Madeira-Mamore Rivers converge in Amazonas State. White rivers (Solimoes, Madeira) contain sediment eroded from younger mountains, loaded with nutrients. Black rivers (Rio Negro and Rio Urubu) are from northern Amazonia, flow over older land with no sediment, slower and warmer, vegetation rots releasing organic acids that turn the water black. The same acids kill mosquito larvae so black-water areas have a low incidence of malaria. Also fewer animals. Clear rivers have neither sediment or organic acids.

Rua XV de Novembro 95, Centro Santos, Sao Paulo. wwwmuseudocafe.org.br<br \/>\nIt\u2019s the spiritual home of coffee. Sure, coffee originated in Ethiopia, but Brazil is by far the world\u2019s biggest producer of the much-loved little pep-up bean: a third of all coffee is cultivated and produced here.<br \/>\nThe museum is housed in the former coffee stock-exchange building \u2013 coffee was Brazil\u2019s primary source of income for much of the 20th century and Santos was where the traders would come to do their coffee business, setting the price of the precious, wonderful bean. The building is striking in its own right, with the trading room\u2019s stained-glass ceiling, the 37-metre clock tower and the art throughout. The museum explores Brazil\u2019s coffee history and industry through permanent and temporary exhibits. You can even buy a coffee at the cafe and enjoy the brew outside as you check out the coffee-bean patterned pavement.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CHILI<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Unesco:<\/strong> 1.

The Inca Trail is the best known of them. Must go with a tour group. Four days passing several Inca ruins, a climb to the highest point, 4215 m Dead Woman\u2019s Pass and on last day arrive at the Sun Gate, the entry point to Mach Picchu. Best to acclimatize in Cuzco at 3600 metres at least 2 days before starting.<br \/>\n2. <strong>The Ancascocha Trail<\/strong> \u2028<br \/>\n<em>Length:<\/em> 19-mile hike from Parpishu to Camicancha (plus bus and train ride to Machu Picchu)\u2028<br \/>\n<em>The Trip:<\/em> Often called the Super Inca Trail or even the Hidden Inca Trail, it is a far more strenuous, yet less traveled and a more rewarding path than the Inca Trail which is crowded. The ruins of Machu Picchu and the surrounding passes and peaks of the Andes should remain on any bucket list.\u2028<br \/>\nThe trek takes roughly five or six days wandering through traditional villages like Chillipahua at 12,000 feet and its namesake Ancascocha at 12,795 feet. Along the way, it goes over big passes, including a high point of roughly 16,000 feet on Inca Chiriaska, and takes in views of towering 20,551-foot Salcantay. The trail doesn\u2019t actually end at Machu Picchu; you need a short bus and train ride to get there,<br \/>\n<em>When to Go:<\/em> Spring (April-May) and fall (September-October) are best, avoiding the winter storms and minimizing the hordes of tourists that arrive at Machu Picchu in summer.<br \/>\n3. <strong>Santa Cruz Trek<\/strong>, Cordillera Blanca \u2028\u2028<br \/>\n<em>Length:<\/em> 30-plus miles over 4 days\u2028<br \/>\n<em>The Trip:<\/em> The Cordillera Blanca are one of the most concentrated collections of big peaks in the Western Hemisphere, with 33 summits topping 18,000 feet and 16 over 19,500 feet, including 22,205-foot Huascar\u00e1n, the highest mountain in Peru, all squeezed into a 13-mile-wide, 112-mile-long corridor. It offers the solitude of big mountains with far less of the hassle of the premier routes in the Himalayas. It&#8217;s also a less-crowded alternative to the Inca Trail.<br \/>\nThe hike begins in the lively city of Huaraz, often referred to as the \u201chiking capital of Peru,\u201d where you can hire guides. Seeing a little bit of everything, it may be the easiest way to experience high altitude as it crosses 15,580-foot Punta Union Pass.<br \/>\nFrom Huarez, you can also organize more ambitious routes like the 11-day Huayhuash Circuit that crosses 18,012-foot Punta Coyoc.\u2028There are also numerous day hikes out of Huaraz that get deep into the heights of the Cordillera Blanca. You can reach the stunning blue waters of 14,600-foot Laguna Churup via a 6.4-<em>mile round-trip hike and scramble.<br \/>\nWhen to Go:<\/em> April through September. The weather can be incredibly reliable here for such high mountains.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SURINAME<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Unesco:<\/strong> 1. Central Suriname Nature Reserve 2.

Roraima<\/strong><br \/>\n<em>The Trip:<\/em> This 6-day trip climbs Roraima, the highest and only one of over 100 tepuis that can be climbed. These kilometre high plateaus of 3 billion year old sandstone make for one of the most intriguing landscapes in the world. The top is black from cyanobacteria with wear areas of yellow where people have walked. The point where Venezuela, Brazil and Guyana borders meet is on top of Roraima.
