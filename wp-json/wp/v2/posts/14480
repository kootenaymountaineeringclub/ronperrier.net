Torn by war, terrorism and violence since 1948 by Pakistan militant groups, this beautiful valley has long been considered a dangerous place to go to, but tourism is slowly coming back to the valley as militancy, which began in the early 90 has come down. The most famous places to visit in Kashmir are\u00a0Srinagar,\u00a0Pahalgam\u00a0and\u00a0Gulmarg. Other places include\u00a0Sonamarg\u00a0and\u00a0Verinag. There are various trekking routes available across whole of Kashmir. Adventure sports in the form of water rafting and paragliding, among others, are available at various tourist locations. The Royal Springs&#8217; Golf course in the heart of Srinagar on the shores of the world famous Dal Lake is one of the most beautiful golf courses around.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Talk. <\/strong>The official state language is\u00a0Urdu, though the most commonly spoken language in the Vale of Kashmir is\u00a0Kashmiri (or Kashur). The younger generation speaks English quite well. Most of the sign-boards and directions are written in English. Others include Gojri and\u00a0Dogri. Hindi is also widely spoken across Kashmir.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GET IN<br \/>\nBy plane. <\/strong>Almost all the domestic airlines in India fly from\u00a0Delhi\u00a0to\u00a0Srinagar. There are flights from Mumbai and Jammu too, and to Jeddah during the Haj Season.<br \/>\n<strong>By train.<\/strong> Jammu, Udhampur and Katra in Jammu Division are connected to the Indian Railways, and are connected to several major Indian cities. In order to get to Kashmir valley, the shortest way is to get off at Udhampur, and then travel by car or bus to Banihal. There is a &#8216;hanging&#8217; railway in Kashmir Valley from Banihal to Baramulla, serving the cities of Anantnag and Srinagar en-route. The link from Banihal to Katra is expected to be complete in the next few years, which will connect the valley to the rest of the Indian rail network.<br \/>\n<strong>By road. <\/strong>From Jammu, various places in Kashmir are 6-8 hours by road. You can also hire a taxi or take a bus 20 hours from New Delhi. The landscape is very interesting from Jammu and many travellers prefer the road trip from there. Experience the famous\u00a0rajmah chawal\u00a0in Peerah and Pattisa (sweet made in ghee) in Kudd.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GET AROUND<br \/>\n<\/strong>The best way to travel across the known destinations in Kashmir is to hire a taxi for about $US60 a day. If you want to visit high altitude lakes and mountaineering destinations you can hire a horse to carry your stuff up the mountains.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MONEY <\/strong>Kashmiri Pashmina is exclusively Kashmiri can cost over $US450.<\/p>\n<p><strong>EAT<\/strong><br \/>\nRich and redolent with the flavour of cinnamon, cardamom, cloves and saffron, Kashmiri food is suitable for all palates. Predominantly non-vegetarian,\u00a0&#8220;Wazwaan&#8221;\u00a0as it is called is the royal cuisine of Kashmir. It&#8217;s a preparation of a number of spicy meat dishes served with traditional rice by professional chefs called &#8220;Wazas&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><strong>STAY SAFE<\/strong><br \/>\nThe past decade of turmoil has left traces in the Valley. Its important that you register with the Foreigners\u2019 Registration unit of the Tourism Department. The registration counters are at Tourist Reception centres at Srinagar Airport, Srinagar City, Gulmarg, Sonmarg, Phalgam and other places.<br \/>\nIn case of an emergency you can contact the nearest tourist police office or police station. The\u00a0emergency number\u00a0of the Police Control Room is\u00a0100.<br \/>\nPlease be aware that the amount of military presence in the valley can be quite overwhelming for some. You will encounter soldiers with semi-automatic weapons guarding the airport, which may look like a heavily fortified place in a conflict zone before you finally step into the Terminal building. Soldiers will be seen all around the city and outskirts. Also, journies by taxi or bus to any famous tourist spots such as Pahalgam or Kokernag may get uncomfortably delayed due to the passage of long military convoys.<br \/>\n<strong>Personal safety.\u00a0<\/strong>Kashmiris are considered very hospitable people. The Amarnath Yatra in which Hindus annually visit a cave situated deep in high altitude mountains in Pahalgam (supposedly the abode of Lord Shiva) has been going on peacefully for more than a hundred years and Kashmiris have been known to provide all help to the yatris, sometimes even braving harsh mountain weather (which is not that rare considering it&#8217;s a high altitude pilgrimage.) In 2006 a campaign of grenade attacks in Srinagar claimed the lives of six tourists and wounded forty on July 11. The targets included a tourist bus and the Tourist Reception Centre. A similar attack on May 31 against a tourist bus wounded 21. An explosion in a tourist bus in Shalimar Gardens on 29 July 2007 claimed six lives and wounded twenty one.<\/p>\n<p><strong>India<em><br \/>\nExperiences<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Bhuddist chanting<br \/>\nDiwali<br \/>\nExperience a Hindu wedding (at least 3 days!)<br \/>\nExperience Holi<br \/>\nKrishna Janmashtami<br \/>\nKumbha Mela Pilgrimage<br \/>\nPlay field hockey<br \/>\nPlay\/hear Sitar<br \/>\nPractice yoga<br \/>\nVesakha<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><strong>NOMAD MANIA India \u2013 Jammu and Kashmir (Srinigar, Jammu, Kathua, Kargil)<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/span><strong><em>Tentative WHS<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Mughal Gardens in Kashmir (13\/12\/2010)<br \/>\nSilk Road Sites in India (20\/01\/2010)<br \/>\nThe Neolithic Settlement of Burzahom (15\/04\/2014)<br \/>\n<strong><em>Borders: <\/em><\/strong>India-Pakistan<br \/>\n<strong><em>XL: <\/em><\/strong>Kashmir Line of Control<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Cities of Asia and Oceania<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong><strong>SRINAGAR<br \/>\n<em>Airports: <\/em><\/strong>Srinagar (SXR)<br \/>\n<strong><em>Museums:<\/em><\/strong> SPS Museum<br \/>\n<strong><em>Religious Temples<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Jamia Masjid<br \/>\nShankaracharya Temple<br \/>\n<strong><em>Botanical Gardens: <\/em><\/strong>Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Botanical Gardens<br \/>\n<strong><em>Markets: <\/em><\/strong>Srinagar Floating Market<br \/>\n<strong><em>Pedestrian Bridges: <\/em><\/strong>Zero Bridge<\/p>\n<p><strong>JAMMU*<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong><em>Airports: <\/em><\/strong>Jammu (IXJ)<br \/>\n<strong><em>Railway, Metro, Funiculars, Cable Cars: <\/em><\/strong>Jammu Mail Railway (Jammu to Udhampur)<br \/>\n<strong><em>Museums: <\/em><\/strong>Dogra Art Museum<br \/>\n<strong><em>Religious Temples: <\/em><\/strong>Hazratbal Masjid<br \/>\n<strong><em>Castles, Palaces, Forts: <\/em><\/strong>Amar Mahal Palace<br \/>\n<strong><em>Aquariums: <\/em><\/strong>Bagh-e-Bahu Aquarium<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Railway, Metro, Funiculars, Cable Cars<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Gulmarg Gondola<br \/>\nUdhampur: Skyview Patnitop<br \/>\n<strong><em>Religious Temples<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Anantnag: Amarnath Cave Temple<br \/>\nKatra: Vaishno Devi Mandir<br \/>\n<strong><em>World of Nature<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Dachigam NP<br \/>\nHemis NP<br \/>\nKishtwar NP<br \/>\n<strong><em>Lakes<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Dal Lake<br \/>\nWular Lake<br \/>\n<strong><em>Rivers<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Chenab River<br \/>\nJhelum River<br \/>\n<strong><em>Trails 1 \u2013 Treks: <\/em><\/strong>Amarnath Trek<br \/>\n<strong><em>Botanical Gardens: <\/em><\/strong>Kokernag: Botanical Garden<br \/>\n<strong><em>Ski Resorts: <\/em><\/strong>Gulmarg<br \/>\n<strong><em>Indigenous Peoples: <\/em><\/strong>Jammu &amp; Kashmir : Zanskaris<\/p>\n<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br \/>\n<strong>NOMAD MANIA India \u2013 Jammu and Kashmir (Leh, Nubra Valley, Pangong Lake)<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong><em>Tentative WHS: <\/em><\/strong>Cold Desert Cultural Landscape of India (15\/04\/2015)<br \/>\n<strong><em>Borders: <\/em><\/strong>India-Pakistan<br \/>\n<strong><em>XL: <\/em><\/strong>Brokpa communities in Ladakh<br \/>\n<strong><em>Villages and Small Towns<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong><strong>LEH<\/strong> (Jammu and Kashmir) World Cities and Popular Towns<br \/>\n<strong><em>Airports: <\/em><\/strong>Leh (IXL)<br \/>\n<strong><em>Castles, Palaces, Forts: <\/em><\/strong>Leh Palace<\/p>\n<p><strong>DISKIT<\/strong>, Ladakh<strong><em><br \/>\nReligious Monuments: <\/em><\/strong>Diskit Monastery Buddha statue<br \/>\n<strong>LAMAYURU,<\/strong> Ladakh<br \/>\n<strong><em>Religious Temples: <\/em><\/strong>Lamayuru Monastery<br \/>\n<strong>PANAMIK,<\/strong> Ladakh<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Religious Temples<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Chemrey Monastery<br \/>\nThikse: Thikse Monastery<br \/>\n<strong><em>Lakes: <\/em><\/strong>Pangaong Tso<br \/>\n<strong><em>Rivers<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Indus River<br \/>\nShyok River<br \/>\nZanskar River<br \/>\n<strong><em>Trails 1 \u2013 Treks; <\/em><\/strong>Markha Trek (Ladakh)<br \/>\n<strong><em>Indigenous Peoples: <\/em><\/strong>Ladakhis<\/p>\n<p>+++++++++++++++++++<br \/>\n<strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">HIMACHAL PRADESH<\/span> (Shimla, Manali, Nahan, Dharamsala)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Great Himalayan National Park Conservation Area. <\/strong>World Heritage Site, This National Park in the western part of the Himalayan Mountains has high alpine peaks over 6,000m, alpine meadows and riverine forests below 2000m. It includes the upper mountain glacial and snow meltwater sources of several rivers, and the catchments of water supplies that are vital to millions of downstream users: the westerly flowing Jiwa Nal, Sainj and Tirthan Rivers and the north-westerly flowing Parvati River which are all headwater tributaries to the River Beas and subsequently, the Indus River. The GHNPCA protects the monsoon-affected forests and alpine meadows of the Himalayan front ranges. It is part of the Himalaya biodiversity hotspot and includes twenty-five forest types along with a rich assemblage of fauna species, several of which are threatened. This gives the site outstanding significance for biodiversity conservation.<br \/>\nIt is in the \u201cWestern Himalayan Temperate Forests\u201d ecoregion &#8211; home to 805 vascular plant species, 192 species of lichen, 12 species of liverworts and 25 species of mosses, 31 species of mammals, 209 birds, 9 amphibians, 12 reptiles and 125 insects.<br \/>\nHuman settlement related threats pose the greatest concern and include agriculture, localised poaching, traditional grazing, human-wildlife conflicts and hydropower development. Tourism impact is minimal and trekking routes are closely regulated.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mountain Railways of India,<\/strong> World Heritage Site. This site includes three railways.<br \/>\n<strong><em>The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway<\/em><\/strong> was the first, and is still the most outstanding, example of a hill passenger railway. Opened in 1881 in the foothills of the Himalayas in West Bengal (Northeast India), ingenious engineering crossing a mountainous terrain of great beauty. 88.48 kilometers of 2 feet (0.610 meter) gauge track that connects New Jalpaiguri with Darjeeling, passing through Ghoom at an altitude of 2258 meters. The innovative design includes six zigzag reverses and three loops with a ruling gradient of 1:31.<br \/>\n<strong><em>Nilgiri Mountain Railway<\/em><\/strong>, a 46-km long metre-gauge single-track railway in the Nilgiri Hills of Tamil Nadu State was first proposed in 1854, but due to the difficulty of the mountainous location the work only started in 1891 and was completed in 1908. This railway, scaling an elevation of 326 m to 2,203 m, represented the latest technology of the time, a unique rack and pinion traction arrangement to negotiate steep gradient.<br \/>\n<strong><em>Kalka Shimla Railway<\/em><\/strong>, a 96-km long, single track working rail link built in the mid-19th century to provide a service to the highland town of Shimla in the Himalayan foothills of Himachal Pradesh (Northwest India). Has the world&#8217;s highest multi-arc gallery bridge and the world&#8217;s longest tunnel (at the time of construction).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cold Desert Cultural Landscape of India<\/strong> Tentative WHS (15\/04\/2015). In the Himalayas, it stretches from Ladakh (in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, or J&amp;K) in the north to Kinnaur (in the state of Himachal Pradesh, or H.P.) in the south. Administratively, the Leh and Kargil districts of Ladakh division in J&amp;K, Spiti region of the Lahaul and Spiti district in H.P. and a part of Kinnaur District in the state of H.P.<br \/>\nThe region constitutes a Cold Desert biome with harsh climatic conditions, which can be attributed to two factors. One is its location on the leeward side of the Himalayas, which makes it a rain-shadow zone inaccessible to the annual south eastern monsoon winds that sweep the rest of the country, thus creating desert conditions with low levels of precipitation. Second is its very high elevation (ranging from 3000 \u2013 5000m ASL)\u00a0that adds to the coldness in its environment. A huge seasonal variation is seen in the climatic conditions, ranging from short and dry summers with harsh sunlight (maximum temperature to 36\u02daC during the day) to long, windy and freezing winters (minimum temperature -32\u02daC at night). Blizzards, snowstorms and avalanches are common. The soil is not very fertile and the climatic conditions allow very short growing seasons making it a bare landscape. Water resources are minimal and comprise glacier-fed streams.<br \/>\nThe many settlements provide marginally improved conditions for habitation, nestled within valleys protected from harsh winds and located near rivulets. The settlements are small, isolated, sparsely populated with Indo-Mongoloid (Tibetan) people with some parts of western Ladakh occupied by the Dards, who are intermediaries of Ladakhis and Baltis of the neighbouring Baltistan in Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK). The distinct Buddhist culture is similar to Tibet.<br \/>\n<strong>Two distinct regions<\/strong>: (1) the Leh-Kargil areas of Ladakh (J&amp;K) and (2) Spiti Valley (H.P.). Although they have been closely linked throughout the ages politically and socially, the two regions have different histories attributable to their isolated geographic locations and separate access routes, from Indian as well as Tibetan sides. While Ladakh lay on the trade routes from Punjab to Kashmir, and beyond to Baltistan (Skardo), Kashgar, Yarqand, Khotan (Eastern Central Asia or Xinjiang), Gartok, Lhasa (in Tibet) with Leh acting as an important trade centre, Spiti valley was more isolated and split into eastern and western valleys, connected with Ladakh &amp; Tibet on its eastern side &amp; Kinnaur and Kulu on western side through high passes.<br \/>\n<strong>Ladakh<\/strong> (\u2018land of the passes\u2019) is one of the most elevated (2,900 m to 5,900 m msl), and coldest regions (from -30\u00b0C to -70\u00b0C) of the earth. In consonance with the above description, its topography is barren and population sparse inhabited along the river banks of different valleys namely Indus, Nubra, Changthang, Zanskar and Suru. The mean annual precipitation is less than 50 mm, received mostly in the form of snowfall during winters. The region faces fast blowing winds 40-60 km\/hr mainly in the afternoon hours. The soil moisture remains frozen during winters and with low relative humidity during the summer months. Despite such inhospitable conditions for survival, it is postulated that Ladakh has been occupied by humans since pre-historic times, as evidenced in the discovery of Lower Palaeolithic tools, Petroglyphs and other pre-historic art works that mark the beginning of man\u2019s interaction with this cold desert landscape. Evidence of its continued occupation can be ascertained throughout history since then, which is closely associated with Tibet.<br \/>\n<strong>Spiti<\/strong>, locally pronounced as &#8216;Piti&#8217;, is known as the \u2018middle country\u2019 that lies between Tibet and India. Throughout history, it kept changing hands among the various kingdoms of Tibet, Ladakh, Kinnaur, Lahaul and Kullu. Subjugated to successive attacks and influences, rulers paid attributes to one another to keep peace in the region. The original inhabitants were pastoral nomads and worshipped the natural features such as trees, rivers, sun, moon &#8211; the Naga Cult was a cult of snake worship. The river Spiti originates at the base of the Kunzam range and flows eastward to join the Sutlej at Khab in Kinnaur. Spiti has its sub divisional headquarters at Kaza, has 113 villages, of which 81 are permanent settlements and 32 are temporary. The inhabitants are largely dependent on agriculture, wild resources and medicinal plants for their livelihood. About 118 species of the Medicinal and Aromatic Plants are known from the valley.<br \/>\nThe annual average precipitation for Ladakh and Zanskar (J&amp;K) is only around 100 mm while that of Spiti valley (H.P.) is 170 mm as against the annual national average of 1083 mm.<br \/>\nIt is believed that people from Central Asia between Khazakstan and China came to populate these areas during the Bronze Age (circa fourth millenium BCE). They were pastoralists attracted to the valleys and high mountains for summer transhumance.<br \/>\n<strong>Buddhism<\/strong> was first introduced to Ladakh about 200 BCE during the reign of Maurya Emperor, Asoka the Great.<br \/>\n<em><strong>Gompas.<\/strong><\/em> Almost all settlements have Buddhist monasteries or Gompas\u00a0with a trademark prayer flag fluttering on top. Built either on flat land or atop the neighbouring hillock depending upon local factors, these shrines are the centers of the people\u2019s cultural life. Men depend on the social security system of the Gompas. The architecture is an interesting amalgamation of Indian and Tibetan influences, and monastic buildings are deeply Buddhist. Each settlement and its Gompa have their own unique associations and the culture.<br \/>\nThe walls of the monasteries are decorated with frescos depicting Buddhist subjects drawn from Buddha\u2019s life and his ideals. Walls are also embellished with thankas (paintings on cloth) displaying Jataka stories and other Buddhist themes. An exceptional thanka, the biggest in the world is ritually exhibited once in twelve years in Hemis monastery.<br \/>\n<em><strong>Chorten<\/strong><\/em> (\u2018receptacle of worship\u2019 types of stupas), and\u00a0<em><strong>Mani walls<\/strong><\/em>, long and thick platform-like row of stones, about 1 to 1.25 m high and 1.25 m wide, faced with carved stones inscribed with holy mantras.<br \/>\n<em><strong>Buddhist chanting<\/strong>.<\/em> Buddhist lamas in monasteries and villages of Ladakh, Lahul-Spiti and Kinnaur chant sacred texts representing the spirit, philosophy and teachings of the Buddha.<br \/>\n<strong>Culture.<\/strong> The performing arts (traditional dance including mask dance, theater, contemporary plays, folk music), craft-making techniques (thangkas, carpet weaving, pashmina and marino shawls and local quilt weaving, prayer flags of cloth, gold, silver, bronze sculptures, copper objects, wooden furniture including manuscript shelves, stone, stucco and clay), customs (sacred paintings, agriculture farming, kitchen-gardening, culinary, giving birth, wedding, death et al), rituals and beliefs (medicinal ritual called Am-chi), language and literature (heroic accomplishments, folk stories, legends, classical and vernacular language, dialects, songs, poems, ancient scripts), etc. are parts of cultural legacy and well-maintained intangible heritage traditions of the property.<br \/>\n<strong><em>Ki Monastery <\/em><\/strong>(4116m), located 12 km north of Kaza above Ki village is the oldest and biggest monastery of the valley and serves the western population of Spiti. It houses beautiful scriptures and paintings of Buddha and other goddesses. Lamas practice dance, sing and play on pipes and horns.<br \/>\n<strong><em>ThangYug Gompa<\/em><\/strong> is located 13km above Kaza in KazaNallah and serving western part of central Spiti. It generally has a Lama from Tibet. There is a long plateau above this Gompa which leads to Shilla peak.<br \/>\n<strong><em>Kungri Gompa<\/em><\/strong> is situated in the Pin valley about 10 kms from Attargo and serves the population of Pin valley.<br \/>\n<strong><em>Dhanka Monastery<\/em><\/strong> is situated about 25 km east of Kaza and serves eastern part of central Spiti. Dhankar is a big village and capital of Spiti Kingdom. The Monastery has about 100 Lamas and Budhist scriptures in Bhoti language. The Statue of &#8220;Vairochana&#8221; (DhayanBudha) consisting of 4 complete figures seated back to back is the principal figure.<br \/>\n<strong><em>Tabo Monastery<\/em><\/strong> serving the eastern side, is tenth century and located 50 km from Kaza and near TholingGompa in Tibet. It has about 60 Lamas and a large collection of scriptures, wall paintings etc. KyilKhor or Mystic Mandala temple is placed on the backside of the main complex. It is home to some beautiful faded mandalas (frescos).

In 1864, Shimla was declared as the\u00a0summer capital\u00a0of\u00a0British India. After\u00a0independence, the city became the capital of\u00a0Punjab\u00a0and was later made the capital of\u00a0Himachal Pradesh. It is the principal commercial, cultural and educational centre of the state.<br \/>\nSmall hamlets were recorded prior to 1815 when British forces took control of the area. The climatic conditions attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of the\u00a0Himalayas. As the summer capital, Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the\u00a0Simla Accord of 1914\u00a0and the\u00a0Simla Conference\u00a0of 1945. After independence, the state of\u00a0Himachal Pradesh\u00a0came into being in 1948 as a result of the integration of 28\u00a0princely states. Even after independence, the city remained an important political centre, hosting the\u00a0Simla Agreement\u00a0of 1972.<br \/>\nShimla is home to a number of buildings that are styled in the\u00a0Tudorbethan\u00a0and\u00a0neo-Gothic\u00a0architectures dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches: Viceregal Lodge, the\u00a0Christ Church, the\u00a0Jakhu Temple, the\u00a0Mall Road,\u00a0the Ridge\u00a0and\u00a0Annadale. The\u00a0Kalka\u2013Shimla Railway\u00a0line built by the British, a\u00a0UNESCO\u00a0World Heritage Site, is also a major tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race\u00a0MTB Himalaya, which started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the largest\u00a0natural ice skating rink\u00a0in South Asia.
