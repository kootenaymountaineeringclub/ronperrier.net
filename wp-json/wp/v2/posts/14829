It also ended with one. On April 20th television stations in Chad interrupted their normal broadcasts to show a room full of men in uniform\u2014medals gleaming and red berets neatly pressed\u2014where an army spokesman announced the death of Idriss D\u00e9by, who had ruled Chad for 30 years. The announcement came just hours after election officials provisionally declared Mr D\u00e9by the winner of a flawed presidential election held on April 11th. Mr D\u00e9by, who came to power after mounting a coup in 1990, reportedly died after being injured on the battlefield while visiting troops fighting a rebel incursion that began on the very day of the election.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap\" data-caps=\"initial\">Although the exact circumstances surrounding Mr D\u00e9by\u2019s death are not yet clear, the transfer of authority that followed it is highly irregular. The government and parliament have been dissolved and a military council led by Mr D\u00e9by\u2019s 37-year-old son, Mahamat Idriss D\u00e9by, has taken charge. By ignoring the constitution, the army has in effect staged a coup. It says it will rule for 18 months until \u201cfree and democratic\u201d elections can be held. That may be too long for many people in Chad. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a militarised Chad any more\u201d says Bienfait Djiedor, a 31-year-old student in N\u2019Djamena, the capital. \u201cWe want a democratic Chad\u2026where reason rules, not force.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">During his three decades in power Mr D\u00e9by brought neither democracy nor development. Instead he cracked down on opponents, protesters and the press. The recent election was no exception. Witnesses told Human Rights Watch (<small>hrw<\/small>), a monitoring group, that in February police beat peaceful protesters with whips and sticks. In March police officers reportedly drove into a car taking injured demonstrators to hospital, and then pulled the passengers out and hit them. Another protester told\u00a0<small>hrw<\/small>\u00a0he was tortured with electric shocks at the police headquarters.An attempt to arrest an opposition candidate, Yaya Dillo, ended in a shoot-out that he says killed his mother and 11-year-old son.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Although the country has earned billions of dollars from oil, a fifth of its children die before they turn five. Yet Mr D\u00e9by proved adept at winning friends in the West, forming alliances with France and America, which saw him as\u00a0an ally in the fight against jihadists. France has a large military base in Chad.\u00a0Operation Barkhane, its 5,100-strong military force roving the Sahel, has its headquarters in N\u2019Djamena. \u201cFrance loses a courageous friend,\u201d lamented the French government in a statement after Mr D\u00e9by\u2019s death.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">The dictator\u2019s demise is likely to rock an already tottering government beset by opposition on many fronts. Since 2015 the jihadists of Boko Haram have been attacking across the border from neighbouring Nigeria and Niger. Their atrocities have pushed thousands of Chadians from their homes. The government has also faced repeated incursions by rebels based in Libya and Sudan. In 2019 fighters advancing from Libya towards N\u2019Djamena were halted only after French aircraft bombed them.<\/p>\n<div class=\"article__body-text-image\">\n<figure>\n<div data-slim=\"1\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/608\/508\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/20210424_MAM973.png\" sizes=\"300px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/200\/167\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/20210424_MAM973.png 200w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/300\/251\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/20210424_MAM973.png 300w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/400\/334\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/20210424_MAM973.png 400w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/600\/501\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/20210424_MAM973.png 600w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/640\/535\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/20210424_MAM973.png 640w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/800\/668\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/20210424_MAM973.png 800w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/1000\/836\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/20210424_MAM973.png 1000w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/1280\/1069\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/20210424_MAM973.png 1280w\" alt=\"\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">This month\u2019s rebel attack seems to have pushed deep into Chad, with fighting reported some 300km north of the capital. Despite this, France has so far refrained from direct involvement, apparently offering reconnaissance and intelligence support instead. French reluctance to intervene more forcefully may have been crucial. Besides Chad\u2019s president, the rebels claim also to have killed 14 other senior officers in recent fighting.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">The third front where the government has been battling is in the capital itself, recently roiled by repeated protests. Police and demonstrators clashed in February over Mr D\u00e9by\u2019s decision to run for a sixth term, and again this month in the run-up to the election. Opposition leaders have denounced the seizure of power by Mahamat Idriss D\u00e9by as a coup. In a statement America also emphasised the need for a transition \u201cin accordance with the Chadian constitution\u201d, which calls for the head of the National Assembly to take over and to hold elections within 90 days.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">That contrasts with France, which has simply muttered warily about the need to \u201cestablish an inclusive, civilian government\u201d after a \u201climited period\u201d. The younger Mr D\u00e9by will probably maintain a close relationship with France and keep supporting Western efforts to fight jihadists in the Sahel, says Nathaniel Powell, a military historian at Lancaster University in Britain. At the request of Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s president, Chad recently sent 1,200 soldiers to help fight jihadists in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">But the crisis at home may require those forces to come back. The opposition is ready to take to the streets again. Rebels from the north, who claim to be fighting for democracy, are promising to march on the capital. Divisions are appearing in the army, with one general denouncing the transition as a \u201ccoup\u201d. Hence there is \u201ca real fear of civil war\u201d, says Cameron Hudson of the Atlantic Council, an American think-tank. \u201cWe are afraid,\u201d says Ramadan Mahamat, a 37-year-old teacher in N\u2019Djamena. Every Chadian is asking one question: \u201cWhat is going to happen to us?\u201d<br \/>\n=============================================================<\/p>\n<div class=\"css-1r2sn2n e1mdktgm0\">\n<section class=\"css-qm1vln e1m3q8rc0\">\n<div class=\"css-b4a1pi elvs37n0\"><span class=\"css-1mdqtqm e11bnqe00\">The last outpost<\/span><\/div>\n<h1 class=\"css-fk78xg e1t4u3eq0\">Will Chad be the next Western ally in Africa to fall?<\/h1>\n<h2 class=\"css-o55d57 elmr55g0\">Democracy v realpolitik<\/h2>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"css-kpd7oo e1mdktgm0\">\n<section class=\"css-1ugvd2u e18wk22u0\">\n<figure class=\"css-qts40t e1197rjj0\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto\/content-assets\/images\/20231125_MAP003.jpg\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=360,quality=80,format=auto\/content-assets\/images\/20231125_MAP003.jpg 360w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=384,quality=80,format=auto\/content-assets\/images\/20231125_MAP003.jpg 384w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=480,quality=80,format=auto\/content-assets\/images\/20231125_MAP003.jpg 480w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=600,quality=80,format=auto\/content-assets\/images\/20231125_MAP003.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=834,quality=80,format=auto\/content-assets\/images\/20231125_MAP003.jpg 834w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=960,quality=80,format=auto\/content-assets\/images\/20231125_MAP003.jpg 960w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto\/content-assets\/images\/20231125_MAP003.jpg 1096w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto\/content-assets\/images\/20231125_MAP003.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto\/content-assets\/images\/20231125_MAP003.jpg 1424w\" alt=\"French soldiers from the Barkhane mission at the French Air Force base in N'Djamena, Chad\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" data-nimg=\"1\" \/><figcaption class=\"css-18w36g1 edweubf2\"><span class=\"css-nggv6j edweubf0\">Should they stay or should they go?<\/span><span class=\"css-6pzdis edweubf1\">image: afp<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"css-1r2sn2n e1mdktgm0\">\n<div class=\"css-1660rmn euxoahl0\">\n<div class=\"css-1fiks87 e1rnrkkh0\">\n<div class=\"css-19diqro e1f4i2e00\">\n<div class=\"css-w0h03k eygoqsu0\">\n<div><time class=\"css-j5ehde exy50qi0\" datetime=\"2023-11-23T15:08:13.744Z\">Nov 23rd 2023<\/time>\u00a0|\u00a0<span class=\"css-1a0w51d e1p34r340\">ABECHE ECONOMIST\u00a0<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<section class=\"css-1fpllpa ee5d8yd1\" data-body-id=\"cp2\">\n<div class=\"css-knmu16 ee5d8yd2\">\n<p class=\"css-1hno3qs e190yofl0\" data-component=\"paragraph\"><span data-caps=\"initial\">J<\/span><small>ust outside<\/small>\u00a0the French army base in Abeche, a dusty city in eastern Chad, Mohamed Adam waits for his two toddlers. They had spots all over their faces so he took them to the French base, he says. \u201cIf you are sick sometimes they help.\u201d Mr Adam, a taxi driver, is grateful. But even he questions France\u2019s role in Chad. \u201cWe are not fully independent,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s 50% for us, 50% for France.\u201d But he demurs when asked if all French troops should leave. Many others in Abeche are more hostile. Last year protesters tried to break into the base and ripped down the French flag, replacing it with Chad\u2019s.<\/p>\n<p class=\"css-1hno3qs e190yofl0\" data-component=\"paragraph\">Anti-French feeling has grown sharply in the Sahel, the arid strip south of the Sahara, after a long French military intervention failed to stem jihadist violence in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. Deaths in conflict increased from about 800 in 2016 to almost 6,000 in 2021, the last full year of French operations in Mali. A spate of coups has swept across the region since 2020, hitting Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. Those mounting them tried to justify their actions as necessary for security; each scapegoated France to bolster their popularity on the street. French soldiers, who had been invited in, were quickly pushed out, though that has not improved security. The headquarters for France\u2019s operations in those countries is located in a permanent base in Chad\u2019s capital, N\u2019Djamena, long its closest ally in the region. Large French army convoys retreating from Niger are now arriving in the city.<\/p>\n<p><iframe class=\"css-toh5pg eds08f10\" title=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/infographics.economist.com\/2023\/20231125_MAM078\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"css-1hno3qs e190yofl0\" data-component=\"paragraph\">Yet many worry that France may be pushed out of Chad, too. Recent polling shows support for France falling and popularity for Russia rising, says a Western official. Others fear that political tension and threats on Chad\u2019s border could burst into civil war. \u201cIt\u2019s a powder keg that\u2019s going to blow,\u201d says Cameron Hudson of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a think-tank in Washington. That would be a geopolitical nightmare because Chad is a firebreak between several conflagrations in the wider region: civil war and genocide in Sudan; jihadist violence in the Sahel; and strife in the Central African Republic (<small>car<\/small>) and Libya, where the Russian mercenaries of the Wagner Group are operating in both countries (see map).<\/p>\n<p class=\"css-1hno3qs e190yofl0\" data-component=\"paragraph\">Chad has been run by Mahamat Idriss D\u00e9by since April 2021, when his father, Idriss D\u00e9by, was killed on the battlefield by rebels. The older man had seized power in an armed rebellion in 1990. That his son\u2019s takeover was unconstitutional did not bother France. Its president, Emmanuel Macron, promptly flew in for the funeral and publicly emphasised that France would intervene to stop future rebel attacks. His country has long backed dictators in Chad in exchange for Chadian soldiers fighting alongside France in the region and for French bases in the country. That support has extended to French jets bombing rebel columns. In 2019 they pulverised one such rebel advance. It is understood that in 2021 France provided intelligence on rebel movements and made threatening overflights but was never directly asked by Chad\u2019s rulers to strike.<\/p>\n<p class=\"css-1hno3qs e190yofl0\" data-component=\"paragraph\">The younger Mr D\u00e9by at first promised an 18-month transition to elections and that he would not stand in the poll. Yet in October 2022 he extended the transition for another two years and declared that he was eligible to run after all. Outraged opposition groups took to the streets. Chad\u2019s security forces gunned down at least 128 people in a day and locked up hundreds more.<\/p>\n<p class=\"css-1hno3qs e190yofl0\" data-component=\"paragraph\">A constitutional referendum is now scheduled for December and elections late next year. Yet it is highly unlikely that Mr D\u00e9by would lose an election. The main opposition leader, Succ\u00e8s Masra, who left Chad after the bloodshed last year and was pursued by the regime with an international arrest warrant, returned in early November after signing an agreement with Mr D\u00e9by\u2019s government.<\/p>\n<p class=\"css-1hno3qs e190yofl0\" data-component=\"paragraph\">Many fear that Mr Masra, short of cash and with little backing in Washington or Paris, has been co-opted by the regime, possibly with the promise of a government post. \u201cWhen Nelson Mandela signed an agreement with the apartheid regime, does this mean Mandela was co-opted?\u201d says Mr Masra when the allegation is put to him, adding that it is a \u201cpro-democracy agreement\u201d. Even so, few expect a free election.<\/p>\n<p class=\"css-1hno3qs e190yofl0\" data-component=\"paragraph\">A palace coup may be a greater threat to Mr D\u00e9by than the ballot box. The president was not the unanimous choice to take over when his father died. The ruling clique in Chad is from the Zaghawa tribe in the east, who make up only a tiny proportion of Chad\u2019s population. Yet Mr D\u00e9by\u2019s mother is not Zaghawa, causing some jitters. His half-brothers almost certainly have their own presidential aspirations. He has also ruffled feathers by retiring a slew of generals. And though officially neutral in Sudan\u2019s civil war, Mr D\u00e9by has implicitly backed the Rapid Support Forces (<small>rsf<\/small>) and has reportedly allowed the United Arab Emirates (<small>uae<\/small>) to fly in weapons to the group via an airport in Amdjarass, the D\u00e9by family\u2019s home town. At the same time the\u00a0<small>uae<\/small>, which maintains that the flights carry humanitarian aid and not arms, has evidently provided loads of financial support to Mr D\u00e9by\u2019s government.<\/p>\n<p class=\"css-1hno3qs e190yofl0\" data-component=\"paragraph\">Yet many among Chad\u2019s ruling elite have close family and tribal connections to Zaghawa rebel groups in Sudan\u2019s Darfur region. In mid-November the strongest of them declared war on the\u00a0<small>rsf<\/small>. This will ratchet up tensions within Zaghawa ruling circles in N\u2019Djamena. \u201cThis [backing the\u00a0<small>rsf<\/small>] threatens to divide the family and to divide the army,\u201d says a Western diplomat.<\/p>\n<p class=\"css-1hno3qs e190yofl0\" data-component=\"paragraph\">\u201cI don\u2019t think D\u00e9by\u2019s leadership will last a year,\u201d says Mr Hudson. Not everyone is so sure. He faces many threats but is proving to be a surprisingly deft political operator, says Enrica Picco of International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think-tank.<\/p>\n<p class=\"css-1hno3qs e190yofl0\" data-component=\"paragraph\">A palace coup would not necessarily mean a civil war or force the French to leave, though it would raise the risk that either could occur. A military coup by non-Zaghawa officers would be more likely to lead to widespread bloodshed and the French being booted out. Some Arabs even within the ruling coalition are unhappy with Mr D\u00e9by\u2019s leadership, notes Ms Picco.<\/p>\n<p class=\"css-1hno3qs e190yofl0\" data-component=\"paragraph\">It is also possible that rebels could invade from abroad to overthrow Mr D\u00e9by. It was insurgents from Libya who killed his father in 2021, while earlier this year leaked American intelligence cables suggested that Wagner mercenaries were helping southern Chadian rebels in the\u00a0<small>car<\/small>\u00a0in yet another plot to topple Mr D\u00e9by.<\/p>\n<p class=\"css-1hno3qs e190yofl0\" data-component=\"paragraph\">Such threats may explain why Mr D\u00e9by may be looking for new ways to consolidate power. In November Hungary\u2019s parliament approved the deployment of up to 200 soldiers to Chad, supposedly to counter terrorism and illegal migration. Some analysts suspect that this deployment is actually about helping Mr D\u00e9by secure gold fields in the restive north or perhaps even to protect him from a coup.<\/p>\n<p class=\"css-1hno3qs e190yofl0\" data-component=\"paragraph\">An agreement with Khalifa Haftar, a warlord who controls eastern Libya, recently led to attacks by Mr Haftar\u2019s men on Chadian rebel bases in Libya. Mr D\u00e9by also has warm ties with Mr Macron, whom he recently visited in Paris. That relationship, along with Chad\u2019s status as France\u2019s last ally in a vast and volatile region, suggests that France would again use air power against rebel columns attacking from Libya. To Chad\u2019s south, despite Wagner\u2019s alleged scheming, Mr D\u00e9by seems to have fostered surprisingly good relations with Faustin-Archange Touad\u00e9ra, the\u00a0<small>car<\/small>\u2019s president, who agreed to let Chadian forces pursue rebels into his country.<\/p>\n<p class=\"css-1hno3qs e190yofl0\" data-component=\"paragraph\">Another worry for Mr D\u00e9by is the prospect of blowback from Sudan\u2019s civil war, which is already giving him a headache. Yet the end of the war in Sudan could bring even more problems. Many\u00a0<small>rsf<\/small>\u00a0fighters have ties to Chad and axes to grind, despite Mr D\u00e9by\u2019s recent implicit support. Should the\u00a0<small>rsf<\/small>\u00a0defeat Sudan\u2019s official army, some of its men could try to settle scores in Chad. They would almost certainly go after refugees or fighters who have fled across the border. Yet should the\u00a0<small>rsf<\/small>\u00a0lose, large numbers of armed fighters could flood into Chad. They might even head straight for N\u2019Djamena to seize power.<\/p>\n<p class=\"css-1hno3qs e190yofl0\" data-component=\"paragraph\">Western governments have turned a blind eye to Mr D\u00e9by\u2019s bloody authoritarianism, just as they did to his father\u2019s, because they fear that the regime\u2019s collapse could lead to civil war or a pro-Russian regime. After the debacles in Niger and Mali, France thinks pushing Mr D\u00e9by to honour his promise not to run and to hold a free election is \u201ca luxury we cannot afford\u201d, says a Western diplomat. This attitude frustrates Mr Masra, who says that France and America have only ever regarded Chad as useful for security. What about the expectations of our people, he demands?<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A Dictator dies &#8211; Chad&#8217;s strongman president, Idriss Deby, is killed by rebels.
