(1817 \u2013 1891) was a Moldavian, later Romanian liberal statesman, lawyer, historian and publicist; he became Prime Minister of Romania on October 11, 1863, after the 1859 union of the Danubian Principalities under <i>Domnitor<\/i> Alexandru Ioan Cuza, and later served as Foreign Minister under Carol I. He was several times Interior Minister under Cuza and Carol. A polymath, Kog\u0103lniceanu was one of the most influential Romanian intellectuals of his generation. While serving as a professor at <i>Academia Mih\u0103ilean\u0103<\/i>, Kog\u0103lniceanu came into conflict with the authorities over his Romantic nationalist inaugural speech of 1843. He was the ideologue of the abortive 1848 Moldavian revolution, authoring its main document, <i>Dorin\u021bele partidei na\u021bionale din Moldova<\/i>.<br \/>\nFollowing the Crimean War (1853\u20131856), with Prince Grigore Alexandru Ghica, Kog\u0103lniceanu was responsible for drafting legislation to abolish Roma slavery. He \u00a0successfully promoted Cuza, his lifelong friend, to the throne. Kog\u0103lniceanu advanced legislation to revoke traditional ranks and titles, and to secularize the property of monasteries. His efforts at land reform resulted in a censure vote, leading Cuza to enforce them through a <i>coup d&#8217;\u00e9tat<\/i> in May 1864. However, Kog\u0103lniceanu resigned in 1865, following his own conflicts with the monarch. A decade after, he helped create the National Liberal Party, before playing an important part in Romania&#8217;s decision to enter the Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878\u2014a choice which consecrated her independence. He was also instrumental in the acquisition, and later colonization, of Northern Dobruja region.

The dark gilt iconostasis had the most silver jacketed icons I have ever seen.<br \/>\nThe 2-story buildings surrounding the church are austere with stone and wood porticoes. One wall has a small chapel with nice gold mosaics. Outside the wall is a library with a great huge black roof and wonderful frescoes, easily the highlight of the monastery.

Dedicated to St George, it was founded in 1488 and most known for its lovely finely detailed frescoes (1496, 1549) coloured in the backgrounds with \u201cVoronet blue\u201d and gilded stars. The fa\u00e7ade is completely frescoed with the ones on the west end completely preserved but faded especially on the north. The spires are high and pointed and the roof has big overlapping eves. The porch has hundreds of small scenes. Other highlights are the carved and finely painted chairs and throne.<br \/>\nThe monastery buildings are stone with eyebrow windows on the roof.<br \/>\n<strong>Folk Traditions Museum of Bucovina<\/strong>, Gura Humorului. Don\u2019t miss this museum, one of the best ethnography museums I have been to in Europe \u2013 because it is organized around traditional festivals in Romania and you get a great guided tour with terse and entertaining descriptions of each festival. It would appear that most Romanians living in rural areas still celebrate most of these, all laced with a heavy dose of superstition and religion. Start with Nov 29, all about young women trying to find their mate. They fast, eat bread laced with salt and withhold water so that they become dehydrated and then have vivid dreams where their future husband will appear before them. Xmas eve, New Years, Easter and several other days have strong traditions still practiced. The guide spoke great English. 5 Lei, 2 reduced.<br \/>\n<strong>Humor Monastery.<\/strong> With only 5 knick-knack stands (I should have bought a lovely geometric woven rug \u2013 at only 450 Lie it was a good deal), this is again quite different. Founded in the 14<sup>th<\/sup> century, the church was destroyed in the 15<sup>th<\/sup> century and rebuilt in 1530. Painted in 1535, the exterior frescoes are faded on the bottom but the church is completely covered. The open porch has the best frescoes but the ones inside the outer narthex, inner narthex and nave are still quite good. It is much simpler inside with no extravagant icons and few visitors.<br \/>\nThe defensive tower in the NE corner was built by Prince Lupu in 1641. There are foundation ruins and an old ruined portion of wall but most of the wall is a wood fence. This is a nunnery \u2013 there were actually some young nuns. Free \u00a0<strong><em><br \/>\n<\/em>Plesa,<\/strong> in the NM \u201csmall villages\u201d series, the 1\u00bdkm road that climbs up to this hilltop village is rough gravel. The houses spread along the road are a real mixture of new renovated, pastel plaster and some shingled with tiny wood shingles painted.. There is otherwise, besides the ubiquitous church, not much to see.<br \/>\nI then had a bit drive-about courteous of my good friend Google Maps. I finally ended up continuing over the mountain from Plesa but drove on the road 20kms north first to find it ended on a logging road of unknown quality.<br \/>\n<strong>Marginea.<\/strong> Another NM \u201csmall town\u201d, I drove through it twice, but nothing appeared very remarkable. \u00a0<strong><em><br \/>\n<\/em>Sucevita Monastery.<\/strong> This monastery was founded in 1581 and the remarkable frescoes from 1596. It is fortified with massive defensive walls and large guard towers at the entrance and on the corners. Some of the walls and the church were in the process of being renovated with scaffold. The exterior has great mosaics that remain nice on the south but are quite faded and absent in places on the north. The individual scenes are small producing hundreds of saints and bible stories. The monastery portion lines only the east wall and is lovely stone with only a portico in the nunnery.<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiwndH7l-LiAhULEVAKHZj_BbcQjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uncover-romania.com%2Fattractions%2Funesco-heritage-romania%2Fsucevita-monastery%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw2qPwN3lvnSLZYqdkjdRQx-&amp;ust=1560368546291056\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwiwndH7l-LiAhULEVAKHZj_BbcQjRx6BAgBEAU\" data-cthref=\"\/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiwndH7l-LiAhULEVAKHZj_BbcQjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uncover-romania.com%2Fattractions%2Funesco-heritage-romania%2Fsucevita-monastery%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw2qPwN3lvnSLZYqdkjdRQx-&amp;ust=1560368546291056\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/www.uncover-romania.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/sucevita-monastery-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Sucevita Monastery\" width=\"552\" height=\"366\" data-iml=\"1560282152698\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nThe inside has wonderful mosaics with great detail in the faces and clothes, all with a blue background and gilt stars.
