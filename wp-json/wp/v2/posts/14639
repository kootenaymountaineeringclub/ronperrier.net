The islands achieved independence in 1976; however, free elections did not occur until 1993. The politics of this island group remain in something of a state of flux, although this should not bother the tourist seeking a relaxing beach vacation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Outer Seychelles.<\/strong>\u00a0The Outer Seychelles are corralline and mostly uninhabited.

Roads on Mahe are low-traffic, mountainous, narrow roads with steep drops or low walls on the side.<br \/>\nThere are also few places where one could pull over to admire the view, study the map or such. Whenever you see a combination of wide curb and an interesting stop, you should take advantage of the situation. There are no sidewalks. Having a car is a good idea and makes life much more simple. For as little as 100 rupees worth of gas you can see the entire island of Mahe in a couple of days.

However, the heat is usually mitigated by refreshing sea breezes, especially by the beaches. The cooler, drier season is during the southeast monsoon season (May to September) and the warmer, wetter season is during the northwest monsoon (November to March).<br \/>\n<strong>Talk. <\/strong>Seychellois Creole, English and\u00a0French.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SEE<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Culture. <\/strong>Several interesting sights.<br \/>\nArulmigu Navasakti Vinayagar Temple\u00a0in Victoria is the centre of Hinduism on the islands. The temple is beautifully decorated and the ceremonies of the temple are interesting to see. Visitors are welcome, and discreet photography is allowed. Footwear should be removed and left in the vestibule. Please turn off your phone and avoid loud talking.<br \/>\nSeychelles Natural History Museum\u00a0in Victoria is small, inexpensive and interesting. Visitors will learn about the unique nature and geology of the islands.<br \/>\nThe ruined youth village of <strong>Cap Ternay<\/strong>\u00a0is located at the end of a narrow one lane road on Mahe. This quiet and eerily beautiful place is best enjoyed by those who spend a bit of time beforehand reading about the site&#8217;s history.<br \/>\n<strong>Nature.<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Vallee de Mai<\/strong>\u00a0on Praslin is a national park and world heritage site, home to amazing flora and fauna, including the world&#8217;s largest seed: the coco de mer. The remote paths far from the entrance are less crowded and offer the best views, but can be rough and steep.<br \/>\n<strong>Beaches<\/strong>\u00a0Many are untouched and uncrowded, tranquility. At low tide can spot interesting wildlife there: ghost crabs, leaping blennys, flying fish.<br \/>\n<strong>Beau Vallon to Anse hike<\/strong> along coast will take about 1.5-2 hours, scenery breathtaking. Not all beaches are suitable for swimming depending on the time of year, due to the strength and direction of wind, absence or presence of a protective reef and the tide.<br \/>\n<strong>Aldabra Atoll:<\/strong> The world&#8217;s largest coral atoll that stretches about 22 miles east to west and encloses a huge tidal lagoon. Aldabra is the original home of the giant land tortoise and tiger sharks and manta rays can also often be seen here.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Watersports<\/strong>: Explore on a yacht, power boat, catamaran or sailboat. Windsurfing best in May then in October, at the start and end of the trade winds.<br \/>\nScuba diving, snorkeling, and fishing can be done almost anywhere. Baie Ternay is superb and easily acccessible by glass bottom boat tour from Beau Vallon beach &#8211; leave yourself an empty day and walk the beach for a &#8216;last minute&#8217; booking &#8211; great deals can be bartered.<br \/>\nSnorkeling (provided you have your own gear &#8211; some hotels lend masks, snorkels and fins to guests) is free and there are many great spots: off some of the small beaches at Glacis, past Mouse Island at Anse Royale, along the reef at Port Launay (near Ephelia Resort). Often spotted are a wide array of tropical fish, sea turtles, eagle rays and more!<br \/>\n<strong>Land Sports:<\/strong> Golf, tennis, squash, badminton, horseback riding, biking and hiking, Bike rentals and walking tours. Walking is probably the best way to see the smaller islands (La Digue, Praslin), while walking along the main road can be quite intimidating as the roads are narrow and local cars\/busses drive quite quickly. On Mahe it is not advised to ride bicycles, and there are no rental shops within sight. Bird watching is also popular and the islands are home to many of the worlds most treasured and rare species of animals. The best place to do so is Cousin Island which although only 1 km (0.6 miles) in diameter, is home to more than 300,000 birds, but many unique species can be found at ease on Mahe.<br \/>\n<strong>Nightlife:<\/strong> Do not miss most popular Nightclub &#8220;Lovenut&#8221; in the centre of Victoria, 100 metres walk from central Taxi station. Also entertaining are &#8220;Tequila Boom&#8221; at (Bel Ombre) and &#8220;Katiolio&#8221; (near Anse Royale) night clubs. &#8220;Katiolio&#8221; was one of the first nightclubs to open on Mahe and boats an open-air that is directly beside the ocean.<br \/>\n<strong>Hiking\u00a0<\/strong>There are several maintained hiking routes on the main island of Mahe and a few on Praslin. The Seychelles tourism office has a few descriptions of the hiking routes with maps available to be purchased. Check out openstreetmap\u00a0for some hiking tracks around the islands.<br \/>\n<strong>Shopping.<\/strong> Seychelles also has numerous markets, art galleries and shops, colonial Creole-style plantation houses, and the main island of Mah\u00e9 has six museums, a botanical garden, and several national monuments. The market downtown Victoria has a good selection of local produce, and spices for sale that are all grown locally and 100% authentic.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Buy<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Money.<\/strong> Seychelles rupee\u00a0(SCR). To get the best rates, use credit cards as much as possible, and get your cash from ATMs. Credit cards and European debit cards are widely accepted, with the notable exception of gas stations. Petrol must be paid with cash.<br \/>\nTrading in foreign currency has wiped out the previously wide-spread black market, which offered up to twice the official rate.<br \/>\n<strong>Tipping. <\/strong>Most service providers already include a service charge of 5% &#8211; 10%.<br \/>\n<strong>Eat. <\/strong>Creole cooking, varied seafood dishes, coconuts and curries are the most popular. The main product of the country, fish, is cooked in a variety of ways. Especially the red snapper is very tasty and well known to visitors.<br \/>\nSeybrew beer, it tastes similar to a light Bavarian style beer and is a must to get you through those balmy days. You can save yourself a packet buying the beer from stores on the side of the road like the locals do rather than from hotels. A dark Takamaka Rum on the beach under the stars is the best way to end a day on the Seychelles.<br \/>\n<strong>Sleep. <\/strong>The Seychelles are not tolerant of backpackers turning up at the airport without accommodation booked. In such a situation, you will likely be taken to a counter where you will have to book &amp; pay for accommodation for the duration of your trip before being allowed through immigration. Visitors need to provide details of their accommodation on their landing card (Hotel Name, address, phone number).<br \/>\nMost accommodations are relatively expensive and some islands have only one hotel. In fact, some of the islands aren&#8217;t even permanently inhabited and accommodation can be found on fewer than 10. Your best bet for a budget bed is renting an apartment or bungalow, which are available at better rates. Prices greatly increase and accommodation hard to find during December to January and July to August and Easter.<br \/>\nSmall hotels. The common perception of Seychelles only offering an expensive accommodation, however, is an unfortunate one as you truly are likely to find accommodation to fit into almost everyone\u2019s budget. Some establishments will offer you a double room for two persons starting at \u20ac65. At this cost you will not have many luxuries, but you will have the Creole hospitality that has made these islands so famous.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stay safe.<\/strong> Jail terms are stiff and are strictly enforced since the island makes lots of money from tourism. Actual tourist scams are very rare, but it is advisable to check all bills at the restaurants and other establishments before paying.<br \/>\n<strong>Health. <\/strong>Chikungunya virus is a disease spread by mosquitoes, and causes flu-like symptoms. It is increasing in concern and although it is rare to die from it, the joint pain it causes can last for months. Insect repellent can help deter mosquitoes but not much else can be done as a precaution. The disease is native to East Africa and occasionally is introduced and quickly eradicated.<br \/>\nTap water is safe to drink on Mahe and Praslin, but water quality is variable in undeveloped areas. It is recommended to drink bottled water only and to avoid bodies of fresh water like lakes, rivers, ponds, etc.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Respect.<br \/>\n<\/strong>The attitude towards manners and dressing is generally relaxed, and common sense and common courtesy are usually enough to keep one out of trouble. Shorts and T-shirts can be worn almost everywhere. Dress shirt and long trousers are appropriate for a night out in Victoria or for a dinner in an upscale establishment.<br \/>\n<strong>Contact. <\/strong>The Seychelles Tourism board is a great point of reference and they will be able to answer any and all questions you might have. Their website is www.seychelles.travel<br \/>\n<strong>Get out. <\/strong>Try\u00a0Comoros,\u00a0Mauritius, and Maldives.<br \/>\nMany people travel to Comoros and Mauritius because they are similar to Seychelles but the price is generally cheaper. They consist of similar reefs, beaches and they also contain some luxury resorts. However, they travel to Seychelles and Maldives for the exclusivity of it. Seychelles has a multitude of resorts and many fun and exciting activities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>NOMAD MANIA Seychelles \u2013 Mahe, Praslin, La Digue<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong><em>World Heritage Sites: <\/em><\/strong>Vall\u00e9e de Mai Nature Reserve<br \/>\n<strong><em>Tentative WHS:\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>Mission Ruins of Venn&#8217;s Town (01\/02\/2013)<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Islands<br \/>\n<\/em>LA DIGUE<br \/>\n<em>Festivals:\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>La Digue Festival<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><strong><em>Open-Air Museums:\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>La Digue: L&#8217;Union Estate Farm<\/p>\n<p><strong>MAHE<br \/>\n<em>Airports:\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>Mahe (SEZ)<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>VICTORIA (SC)<\/strong>\u00a0World Capital<br \/>\n<strong><em>Museums:\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>Seychelles Natural History Museum<br \/>\n<strong><em>Religious Temples<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception<br \/>\nSt. Paul&#8217;s Cathedral<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong><em>Botanical Gardens:\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>Victoria: Botanical Gardens<br \/>\n<strong><em>Festivals<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Festival Kreol<br \/>\nSeychelles International Carnival of Victoria<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>PRASLIN<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong><em>Airports:\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>Praslin (PRI)<br \/>\n<strong><em>Museums:\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>Praslin: Praslin Museum<br \/>\n<strong><em>Beaches:\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>Praslin: Anse Volbert<br \/>\n<strong><em>World of Nature:\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>Praslin NP<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nSILHOUETTE<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong><em>Tentative WHS:\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>Silhouette Island (01\/02\/2013)<br \/>\n<strong><em>World of Nature:\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>Silhouette Island Marine National Park<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Borders: <\/em><\/strong>Seychelles (sea border\/port)<strong><em><br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>World of Nature<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Aride Island Nature Reserve<br \/>\nCurieuse Marine NP<br \/>\nMorne Seychellois NP<br \/>\nRamos NP<br \/>\nSte Anne Marine NP<br \/>\nSte Anne National Marine Park<br \/>\nVeuve Reserve<br \/>\n<strong><em>Beaches<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Anse Intendance<br \/>\nAnse Lazio<br \/>\nAnse Source D&#8217;Argent<br \/>\nBeau Vallon Beach<br \/>\nCocos Island<\/p>\n<p>+++++++++++++++++++<br \/>\n<strong>NOMAD MANIA Seychelles \u2013 Aldabra, Farquhar Islands<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong><em>M@P<\/em><\/strong>: Aldabra, Amirante, Farquhar, Southern Coral Group<br \/>\n<strong><em>World Heritage Sites: <\/em><\/strong>Aldabra Atoll<br \/>\n<strong><em>Islands<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Aldabra group<br \/>\nAmirante group<br \/>\nFarquhar group<br \/>\n<strong><em>Borders: <\/em><\/strong>Seychelles (sea border\/port)<br \/>\n<strong><em>XL<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Alphonse Group<br \/>\nSouthern Coral Group (\u00cele Platte and Co\u00ebtivy Island)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Seychelles\u00a0are a group of 115 islands, only a few inhabited, in the Indian Ocean that lie off the coast of\u00a0East Africa, northeast of\u00a0Madagascar.
