It is bordered by\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Croatia\">Croatia<\/a>\u00a0to the north, west and south;\u00a0Serbia\u00a0to the east; and\u00a0Montenegro\u00a0to the southeast. In the central and eastern interior of the country the geography is mountainous, in the northwest it is moderately hilly, and the northeast is predominantly flatland. The inland,\u00a0Bosnia, is a geographically larger region and has a moderate\u00a0continental climate, with hot summers and cold and snowy winters. The southern tip,\u00a0Herzegovina, has a\u00a0Mediterranean climate and plain topography.<br \/>\nBosnia and Herzegovina traces permanent human settlement back to the\u00a0Neolithic\u00a0age, during and after which it was populated by several\u00a0Illyrian\u00a0and\u00a0Celtic\u00a0civilizations.<br \/>\nCulturally, politically, and socially, the country has a rich history, having been first settled by the\u00a0Slavic peoples\u00a0that populate the area today from the 6th through to the 9th centuries. In the 12th century the\u00a0Banate of Bosnia was established, which evolved into the\u00a0Kingdom of Bosnia\u00a0in the 14th century, after which it was annexed into the\u00a0Ottoman Empire, under whose rule it remained from the mid-15th to the late 19th centuries. The\u00a0Ottomans\u00a0brought\u00a0Islam\u00a0to the region, and altered much of the cultural and social outlook of the country. This was followed by\u00a0annexation into the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, which lasted up until\u00a0World War I. In the interwar period, Bosnia and Herzegovina was part of the\u00a0Kingdom of Yugoslavia\u00a0and after\u00a0World War II, it was granted full republic status in the newly formed\u00a0Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Following the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the republic\u00a0proclaimed independence\u00a0in 1992, which was followed by the\u00a0Bosnian War, lasting until\u00a0late 1995.<br \/>\nTourism in Bosnia and Herzegovina\u00a0has grown at double digit rates in recent years. Bosnia and Herzegovina is regionally and internationally renowned for its natural environment and\u00a0cultural heritage\u00a0inherited from six historical civilizations, its\u00a0cuisine,\u00a0winter sports, its eclectic and unique\u00a0music,\u00a0architecture, and its\u00a0festivals, some of which are the largest and most prominent of their kind in Southeastern Europe.<br \/>\nThe country is home to three main ethnic groups or, officially,\u00a0constituent peoples, as specified in the constitution.\u00a0Bosniaks\u00a0are the largest group of the three, with\u00a0Serbs\u00a0second, and\u00a0Croats\u00a0third. A native of Bosnia and Herzegovina, regardless of ethnicity, is usually identified in English as a\u00a0Bosnian. Minorities, defined\u00a0under the constitutional nomenclature &#8220;Others&#8221;, include\u00a0Jews,\u00a0Roma,\u00a0Poles, Ukrainians, and Turks. Bosnia and Herzegovina has a\u00a0bicameral\u00a0legislature and a three-member Presidency composed of a member of each major ethnic group. However, the central government&#8217;s power is highly limited, as the country is largely decentralized and comprises two autonomous entities: the\u00a0Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina\u00a0and\u00a0Republika Srpska, with a third unit, the\u00a0Br\u010dko District, governed under local government. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of 10\u00a0cantons.<br \/>\nBosnia and Herzegovina\u00a0ranks highly in terms of human development, and has an economy dominated by the industry and agriculture sectors, followed by the tourism and service sectors.\u00a0The country has a social security and universal healthcare system, and primary- and secondary-level education is tuition-free. It is a member of the\u00a0UN,\u00a0OSCE,\u00a0Council of Europe,\u00a0PfP,\u00a0CEFTA, and a founding member of the\u00a0Union for the Mediterranean\u00a0upon its establishment in July 2008.\u00a0The country is a\u00a0potential candidate for membership to the European Union\u00a0and has been a candidate for\u00a0NATO\u00a0membership since April 2010, when it received a\u00a0Membership Action Plan.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GEOGRAPHY<\/strong><br \/>\nBosnia is in the western\u00a0Balkans, bordering\u00a0Croatia\u00a0(932\u00a0km or 579\u00a0mi) to the north and west,\u00a0Serbia\u00a0(302\u00a0km or 188\u00a0mi) to the east, and\u00a0Montenegro\u00a0(225\u00a0km or 140\u00a0mi) to the southeast. It has a coastline about 20 kilometres (12 miles) long surrounding the city of\u00a0Neum.<br \/>\nThe country&#8217;s name comes from the two alleged regions\u00a0Bosnia\u00a0and\u00a0Herzegovina\u00a0whose border was never defined. Historically, Bosnia&#8217;s official name never included any of its many regions until the Austria-Hungarian occupation.<br \/>\nThe country is mostly mountainous, encompassing the central\u00a0Dinaric Alps. The northeastern parts reach into the\u00a0Pannonian Plain, while in the south it borders the\u00a0Adriatic. The Dinaric Alps generally run in a southeast-northwest direction, and get higher towards the south. The highest point of the country is the peak of\u00a0Magli\u0107\u00a0at 2,386 metres (7,828.1 feet), on the Montenegrin border. Major mountains include\u00a0Kozara,\u00a0Grme\u010d,\u00a0Vla\u0161i\u0107,\u00a0\u010cvrsnica,\u00a0Prenj,\u00a0Romanija,\u00a0Jahorina,\u00a0Bjela\u0161nica\u00a0and\u00a0Treskavica. The geological composition of the Dinaric chain of mountains in Bosnia consists primarily of\u00a0limestone(including\u00a0Mesozoic\u00a0limestone), with deposits of\u00a0iron,\u00a0coal,\u00a0zinc,\u00a0manganese,\u00a0bauxite,\u00a0lead, and\u00a0salt\u00a0present in some areas, especially in central and northern Bosnia.<br \/>\nOverall, close to 50% of Bosnia and Herzegovina is forested. Most forest areas are in the centre, east and west parts of Bosnia. Herzegovina has drier Mediterranean climate, with dominant\u00a0karst\u00a0topography. Northern Bosnia (Posavina) contains very fertile agricultural land along the River Sava and the corresponding area is heavily farmed. This farmland is a part of the Pannonian Plain stretching into neighboring Croatia and Serbia. The country has only 20 kilometres (12 miles) of coastline,\u00a0around the town of\u00a0Neum\u00a0in the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton. Although the city is surrounded by Croatian peninsulas, by international law, Bosnia and Herzegovina has a\u00a0right of passage\u00a0to the outer sea.<br \/>\nSarajevo\u00a0is the capital\u00a0and largest city.\u00a0Other major cities are\u00a0Banja Luka\u00a0and\u00a0Biha\u0107\u00a0in the northwest region known as\u00a0Bosanska Krajina,\u00a0Bijeljina\u00a0and\u00a0Tuzla\u00a0in the northeast,\u00a0Zenica\u00a0in the central part of Bosnia and\u00a0Mostar, the largest city in\u00a0Herzegovina.<br \/>\nThere are seven major rivers in Bosnia and Herzegovina: The\u00a0Sava\u00a0is the largest river of the country, and forms its northern\u00a0natural border\u00a0with Croatia. It drains 76%\u00a0of the country&#8217;s territory into the Danube and then the Black Sea. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a member of the\u00a0International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River\u00a0(ICPDR).<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Una,\u00a0Sana\u00a0and\u00a0Vrbas\u00a0are right tributaries of Sava river. They are in the northwestern region of Bosanska Krajina.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Bosna\u00a0river gave its name to the country, and is the longest river fully contained within it. It stretches through central Bosnia, from its source near\u00a0Sarajevo\u00a0to Sava in the north.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Drina\u00a0flows through the eastern part of Bosnia, and for the most part it forms a natural border with Serbia.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Neretva\u00a0is the major river of Herzegovina and the only major river that flows south, into the Adriatic Sea.<br \/>\nPhytogeographically, Bosnia and Herzegovina belongs to the\u00a0Boreal Kingdom\u00a0and is shared between the Illyrian province of the\u00a0Circumboreal Region\u00a0and Adriatic province of the\u00a0Mediterranean Region. According to the\u00a0World Wide Fund for Nature, the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina can be subdivided into three\u00a0ecoregions: the Pannonian\u00a0mixed forests, Dinaric Mountains mixed forests and Illyrian\u00a0deciduous forests.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DEMOGRAPHICS<br \/>\n<\/strong>According to the\u00a01991 census, Bosnia and Herzegovina had a population of 4,377,000, while the 1996 UNHCR unofficial census showed a decrease to 3,920,000.\u00a0Large population migrations during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s have caused demographic shifts in the country. Between 1991 and 2013, political disagreements made it impossible to organize a census. The\u00a02013 census\u00a0found a total population of 3,791,622 people in 1.16 million households; 585,411 fewer people than the 1991 census.<br \/>\n<strong>Ethnic groups<br \/>\n<\/strong>Bosnia and Herzegovina is home to three ethnic &#8220;constituent peoples: Bosniaks\u00a0(50.11%), Serbs\u00a0(30.78%),\u00a0Croats\u00a0(15.43%) and\u00a0Others (2.73%), plus a number of smaller groups including\u00a0Jews\u00a0and\u00a0Roma.\u00a0According to data from\u00a02013 census\u00a0published by the Agency for Statistics of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bosniaks constitute 50.11% of the population, Serbs 30.78%, Croats 15.43%, and others form 2.73%, with the remaining respondents not declaring their ethnicity or not answering.<br \/>\n<strong>Religion<\/strong>.<br \/>\nIn the 2013 census,\u00a0Islam\u00a0is the majority faith in Bosnia and Herzegovina, making up 51% of the population with Sunni Muslims making up 38% and the rest are either Shia or follow other denominations or don&#8217;t identify with any denomination. 46% of the population identify as\u00a0Christian; of these, the\u00a0Serbian Orthodox Church makes up the largest group, accounting for 31% of the population (of whom most identify as\u00a0Serbs), and the\u00a0Roman Catholic Church\u00a015% (of whom most identify as\u00a0Croats). The smallest groups are\u00a0Agnosticism\u00a00.3%,\u00a0Atheism\u00a00.8% and other 1.15%, with the remainder not declaring their religion or not answering 1.1%. A 2012 survey found 54% of Bosnia&#8217;s\u00a0Muslims\u00a0are\u00a0non-denominational Muslims, while 38% follow\u00a0Sunnism.<br \/>\n<strong>Languages.<br \/>\n<\/strong>Bosnia&#8217;s constitution does not specify any official languages, but\u00a0Bosnian,\u00a0Croatian, English and\u00a0Serbian are as the &#8220;de facto recognition of three official languages at the state level. The equal status of Bosnian, Serbian and Croatian was verified by the Constitutional Court in 2000.\u00a0It ruled the provisions of the Federation and Republika Srpska constitutions on language were incompatible with the state constitution, since they only recognised &#8220;Bosniak&#8221; and Croatian (in the case of the Federation) and Serbian (in the case of Republika Srpska) as official languages at the entity level. As a result, the wording of the entity constitutions was changed and all three languages were made official in both entities.\u00a0The three\u00a0standard languages\u00a0are fully\u00a0mutually intelligible\u00a0and are known collectively under the appellation of\u00a0Serbo-Croatian, despite this term not being formally recognized in the country. Use of one of the three languages has become a marker of ethnic identity.<br \/>\nAccording to the 1992\u00a0European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, Bosnia and Herzegovina recognizes the following minority languages:\u00a0Albanian,\u00a0Montenegrin,\u00a0Czech,\u00a0Italian,\u00a0Hungarian,\u00a0Macedonian,\u00a0German,\u00a0Polish,\u00a0Romani,\u00a0Romanian,\u00a0Rusyn,\u00a0Slovak,\u00a0Slovene,\u00a0Turkish,\u00a0Ukrainian\u00a0and Jewish (Yiddish\u00a0and\u00a0Ladino).\u00a0The German minority in Bosnia and Herzegovina are mostly remnants of\u00a0Donauschwaben\u00a0(Danube Swabians), who settled in the area after the\u00a0Habsburg monarchy\u00a0claimed the Balkans from the\u00a0Ottoman Empire. Due to\u00a0expulsions\u00a0and\u00a0(forced) assimilation\u00a0after the two\u00a0World Wars, the number of ethnic Germans in Bosnia and Herzegovina was drastically diminished.<br \/>\nIn a 2013 census, 52.86% of the population consider their mother tongue Bosnian, 30.76% Serbian, 14.6% Croatian and 1.57% another language, with 0.21% not giving an answer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ECONOMY<\/strong><br \/>\nDuring the\u00a0Bosnian War, the economy suffered \u20ac200 billion in material damages.\u00a0Bosnia and Herzegovina faces the dual-problem of rebuilding a war-torn country and introducing transitional liberal market reforms to its formerly mixed economy. One legacy of the previous era is a strong industry; under former republic president\u00a0D\u017eemal Bijedi\u0107\u00a0and SFRY President\u00a0Josip Broz Tito, metal industries were promoted in the republic, resulting in the development of a large share of Yugoslavia&#8217;s plants; S.R. Bosnia and Herzegovina had a very strong industrial export oriented economy in the 1970s and 1980s, with large scale exports worth millions of\u00a0US$.<br \/>\nFor most of Bosnia&#8217;s history, agriculture has been conducted on privately owned farms; Fresh food has traditionally been exported from the republic.<br \/>\nThe war in the 1990s, caused a dramatic change in the Bosnian economy.\u00a0GDP fell by 60% and the destruction of physical infrastructure devastated the economy.\u00a0With much of the production capacity unrestored, the Bosnian economy still faces considerable difficulties. Figures show GDP and per capita income increased 10% from 2003 to 2004; this and Bosnia&#8217;s shrinking\u00a0national debt\u00a0being negative trends, and high unemployment 38.7% and a large\u00a0trade deficit\u00a0remain cause for concern.<br \/>\nThe national currency is the (Euro-pegged)\u00a0Convertible Mark\u00a0(KM), controlled by the\u00a0currency board. Annual inflation is the lowest relative to other countries in the region at 1.9% in 2004.\u00a0The international debt was $5.1\u00a0billion (as on 31 December 2014)\u00a0.\u00a0Real GDP\u00a0growth rate was 5% for 2004 according to the Bosnian\u00a0Central Bank of BiH\u00a0and Statistical Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina.<br \/>\nBosnia and Herzegovina has displayed positive progress in the previous years, which decisively moved its place from the lowest income equality rank of\u00a0income equality rankings\u00a0fourteen out of 193 nations.<br \/>\nAccording to\u00a0Eurostat\u00a0data, Bosnia and Herzegovina&#8217;s PPS GDP per capita stood at 29 per cent of the EU average in 2010.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0International Monetary Fund\u00a0(IMF) announced a loan to Bosnia worth US$500 million to be delivered by\u00a0Stand-By Arrangement.
