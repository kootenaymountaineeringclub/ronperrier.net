Kayaks are essentially spacious floating coolers. Food lasts a long time. This allows much more variety than backpacking. I often take frozen meals from home for the first few days and fresh vegetables for use anytime during the trip (a large plastic box is useful for storing vegetables especially tomatoes, avocados, peppers, cilantro, green onions). Fishing gives a cheap, good source of food during the trip. Refer to dehydrating instructions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Staples<\/strong>. Salt and pepper, oil, margarine (tube), jam (tube), spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, curry powder or paste), sugar, breading for fish (3\/4c corn meal, 1tsp. salt, 1 tsp. pepper, 1 tsp garlic powder, \u00bc tsp. cayenne. Prepare at home. When ready to use, separate into small bags so maximize use), bread.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Drinks<\/strong>. Tea, coffee (bodum), hot chocolate, coffee creamer, lemonade drink mix, wine in bladder, hard liquor, milk (will often last several days especially if not hot out. Buy whole fat milk), coffee creamer (International Delight).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Snacks<\/strong>. Granola bars, Lara bars, chocolate bars, mixed nuts, gorp, chocolate covered almonds, currants or raisons, biscotti, chocolate covered macaroons, datesm dried cranberries, Ritz crackers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Appetizers<\/strong>. Popcorn (always a favorite): a good pot is necessary (I have a pot that I place on high heat, add a few kernels, when they pop, add the rest and wait till it is all popped, never burns), fondue, sushi.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MENU PLANS<\/strong><br \/>\nGo to the HIKING page for information on all things to do with food: dehydrating and a much larger selection of recipes.
