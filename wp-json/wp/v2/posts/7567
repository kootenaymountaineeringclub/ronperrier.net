Enter the woods above and behind the portal and travel through light brush following a small water course on its left side. The brush gives way to open grassy slopes beneath some rocky bluffs.

At this point look up to your right and Grays Peak is visible with an edge of the glacier showing. Traverse meadows to the right (southeast; northwest goes toward Cond Peak) and sidehill left up to a ridge which separates you from the access pass. The ridge can be penetrated in two spots (vegetation). Quite low on the ridge there is an obvious grassy ramp used by goats. When you reach the ridge, the route to the low pass (col) between Kokanee Peak and Grays Peak is obvious. Keep high, and scramble over a rocky rib to gain the pass.

Take the old steep trail (on the hillside at the parking lot at Gibson Lake) until it meets the road. Follow the road uphill and around a switchback until the road crosses a small stream.

We followed the standard route to the Keyhole, and then subdued (I&#8217;m being sarcastic, here) that unnamed 9,100&#8242; bump N. of Esmeralda, Esmeralda, and Cond. We then plodded over to Kokanee Pk. via the glacier, just a snow walk once again. We next descended S. on snow to the col between Grays and Kokanee and continued SW via snow and a moderate bushwhack right to Gibson Lake. These are the only times I have: departed at 9:20 am; reached the Keyhole at 12:20 pm; and returned to cars by 4:30 pm. So, the total loop took a leisurely seven hours; I can&#8217;t imagine that we were going really fast.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">These easy trips have been, and are, frequently made, so I certainly would be embarrassed to claim many firsts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">There are two more things to note. I seem to remember that one can get into cliff bands descending directly to Gibson Lake from the Kokanee Pk.-Esmeralda Pk. area. Secondly, I think the usual approach to the Grays Pk.-Kokanee Pk. col is via an alpine traverse from the Keyhole trail.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Kim Kratky<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The summits on the rim of Kokanee Glacier, from The Pyramid to Kokanee Peak, are part of a large massif which supports the glacier.
