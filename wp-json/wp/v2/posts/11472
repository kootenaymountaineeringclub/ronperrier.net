It is bordered to the north by the Gulf of Finland with Finland on the other side, to the west by the Baltic Sea with Sweden on the other side, to the south by Latvia (343\u00a0km), and to the east by Lake Peipus and Russia (338.6\u00a0km). The territory of Estonia consists of a mainland and 2,222 islands in the Baltic Sea, covering a total area of 45,227\u00a0km2, water 2,839\u00a0km2, land area 42,388\u00a0km2, and is influenced by a humid continental climate. The official language of the country, Estonian, is the second-most-spoken Finnic language.<br \/>\nThe territory of Estonia has been inhabited since at least 9,000 B.C. Ancient Estonians were some of the last European pagans to be Christianized, following the Livonian Crusade in the 13th century. After centuries of successive rule by Germans, Danes, Swedes, Poles and Russians, a distinct Estonian national identity began to emerge in the 19th and early 20th centuries. This culminated in independence from Russia in 1920 after a brief War of Independence at the end of World War I. Initially democratic, subsequent to the Great Depression, Estonia was governed by authoritarian rule since 1934 during the Era of Silence. During World War II (1939\u20131945), Estonia was repeatedly contested and occupied by the Soviet Union and Germany, ultimately being incorporated into the former. After the loss of its de facto independence, Estonia&#8217;s de jure state continuity was preserved by diplomatic representatives and the government-in-exile. In 1987 the peaceful Singing Revolution began against Soviet rule, resulting in the restoration of de facto independence on 20 August 1991.<br \/>\nThe sovereign state of Estonia is a democratic unitary parliamentary republic divided into fifteen counties. Its capital and largest city is Tallinn. With a population of 1.3 million, it is one of the least populous members of the European Union, the Eurozone, OECD, the Schengen Area, NATO, and from 2020, the United Nations Security Council.<br \/>\nEstonia is a developed country with an advanced, high-income economy that has been among the fastest-growing in the EU. The country ranks very high in the Human Development Index, and performs favourably in measurements of economic freedom, civil liberties, education, and press freedom (third in the world in 2012 and 2007). Estonian citizens are provided with universal health care, free education, and the longest-paid maternity leave in the OECD. One of the world&#8217;s most digitally advanced societies, in 2005, Estonia became the first state to hold elections over the Internet, and in 2014, the first state to provide e-residency.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Etymology<br \/>\n<\/strong>In the Estonian language the oldest known endonym of the Estonians was maarahvas, meaning &#8220;country people&#8221; or &#8220;people of the soil&#8221;. The land inhabited by Estonians was called Maavald meaning &#8220;Country Realm&#8221; or &#8220;Land Realm&#8221;.<br \/>\nAncient Scandinavian sagas refer to an area called Eistland, as the country is still called in Icelandic, with close parallels to the Danish, German, Dutch, Swedish and Norwegian terms Estland for the country.<br \/>\nEsthonia was a common alternative English spelling before 1921<\/p>\n<p><strong>HISTORY<br \/>\nPrehistory. <\/strong>Human settlement in Estonia became possible 13,000 to 11,000\u00a0years ago, when the ice from the last glacial era melted. The oldest known settlement in Estonia is the Pulli settlement, which was on the banks of the river P\u00e4rnu, near the town of Sindi, in south-western Estonia. According to radiocarbon dating it was settled around 11,000\u00a0years ago.<br \/>\nThe earliest human inhabitation during the Mesolithic period is connected to the Kunda culture, named after the town of Kunda in northern Estonia. At that time the country was covered with forests, and people lived in semi-nomadic communities near bodies of water. Subsistence activities consisted of hunting, gathering and fishing. Around 4900 BC appear ceramics of the neolithic period, known as Narva culture. Starting from around 3200 BC the Corded Ware culture appeared; this included new activities like primitive agriculture and animal husbandry.<br \/>\nThe Bronze Age started around 1800 BC, and saw the establishment of the first hill fort settlements. A transition from hunting-fishing-gathering subsistence to single-farm-based settlement started around 1000 BC, and was complete by the beginning of the Iron Age around 500 BC. The large amount of bronze objects indicate the existence of active communication with Scandinavian and Germanic tribes.<br \/>\n<strong>Viking Age. <\/strong>The areas of Northern and Western Estonia belonged in the Scandinavian cultural sphere during the Viking Age. Estonia was not a unified country during the Viking Age, and the area of Ancient Estonia was divided among loosely allied regions. The Viking Age in Estonia is often considered to be part of the Iron Age period which started around 400 AD and ended around 1200 AD, soon after Estonian Vikings were recorded in the Eric Chronicle to have sacked Sigtuna in 1187.<br \/>\nThe middle iron age produced threats appearing from different directions. Several Scandinavian sagas referred to major confrontations with Estonians, notably when &#8220;Estonian Vikings&#8221; defeated and killed the Swedish king Ingvar. Similar threats appeared in the east, where Russian principalities were expanding westward. In 1030 Yaroslav the Wise defeated Estonians and established a fort in modern-day Tartu; this foothold lasted until an Estonian tribe, the Sosols, destroyed it in 1061, followed by their raid on Pskov. Around the 11th century, the Scandinavian Viking era around the Baltic Sea was succeeded by the Baltic Viking era, with seaborne raids by Curonians and by Estonians from the island of Saaremaa, known as Oeselians. In 1187 Estonians (Oeselians), Curonians or\/and Karelians sacked Sigtuna, which was a major city of Sweden at the time.<br \/>\nThe society, economy, settlement and culture of the territory of what is in the present-day the country of Estonia is studied mainly through archaeological sources. The era is seen to have been a period of rapid change. The Estonian peasant culture came into existence by the end of the Viking Age. The overall understanding of the Viking Age in Estonia is deemed to be fragmentary and superficial, because of the limited amount of surviving source material. The main sources for understanding the period are remains of the farms and fortresses of the era, cemeteries and a large amount of excavated objects.<br \/>\nThe landscape of Ancient Estonia featured numerous hillforts, some later hillforts on Saaremaa heavily fortified during the Viking Age and on to the 12th century. There were a number of late prehistoric or medieval harbour sites on the coast of Saaremaa, but none have been found that are large enough to be international trade centres. The Estonian islands also have a number of graves from the Viking Age, both individual and collective, with weapons and jewellery. Weapons found in Estonian Viking Age graves are common to types found throughout Northern Europe and Scandinavia.<br \/>\nIn the early centuries AD, political and administrative subdivisions began to emerge in Estonia. Two larger subdivisions appeared: the parish and the county, which consisted of multiple parishes. A parish was led by elders and centred around a hill fort; in some rare cases a parish had multiple forts. By the 13th century Estonia consisted of eight major counties: Harjumaa, J\u00e4rvamaa, L\u00e4\u00e4nemaa, Revala, Saaremaa, Sakala, Ugandi, and Virumaa; and six minor, single-parish counties: Alempois, Jogentagana, M\u00f5hu, Nurmekund, Soopoolitse, and Vaiga. Counties were independent entities and engaged only in a loose co-operation against foreign threats.<br \/>\nThere is little known of early Estonian pagan religious practices. The Chronicle of Henry of Livonia mentions Tharapita as the superior god of the Oeselians. Spiritual practices were guided by shamans, with sacred groves, especially oak groves, serving as places of worship.<br \/>\n<strong>Middle Ages and German influences. <\/strong>In 1199 Pope Innocent III declared a crusade to &#8220;defend the Christians of Livonia&#8221;. Fighting reached Estonia in 1206, when Danish king Valdemar II unsuccessfully invaded Saaremaa. The German Livonian Brothers of the Sword, who had previously subjugated Livonians, Latgalians, and Selonians, started campaigning against the Estonians in 1208, and over next few years both sides made numerous raids and counter-raids. A major leader of the Estonian resistance was Lembitu, an elder of Sakala County, but in 1217 the Estonians suffered a significant defeat in the Battle of St. Matthew&#8217;s Day, where Lembitu was killed. In 1219, Valdemar II landed at Lindanise, defeated the Estonians in battle, and started conquering Northern Estonia. The next year, Sweden invaded Western Estonia, but were repelled by the Oeselians. In 1223, a major revolt ejected the Germans and Danes from the whole of Estonia, except Reval, but the crusaders soon resumed their offensive, and in 1227, Saaremaa was the last county to surrender.<br \/>\nAfter the crusade, the territory of present-day Southern Estonia and Latvia was named Terra Mariana, but later it became known simply as Livonia. Northern-Estonia became the Danish Duchy of Estonia, while the rest was divided between the Sword Brothers and prince-bishoprics of Dorpat and \u00d6sel\u2013Wiek. In 1236, after suffering a major defeat, the Sword Brothers merged into the Teutonic Order becoming the Livonian Order. In the next decades there were several uprisings against foreign rulers on Saaremaa. In 1343, a major rebellion started, known as the St. George&#8217;s Night Uprising, encompassing the whole area of Northern-Estonia and Saaremaa. The Teutonic Order finished suppressing the rebellion in 1345, and the next year the Danish king sold his possessions in Estonia to the Order. The unsuccessful rebellion led to a consolidation of power for the Baltic German minority. For the subsequent centuries they remained the ruling elite in both cities and the countryside.<br \/>\nDuring the crusade, Reval (Tallinn) was founded, as the capital of Danish Estonia, on the site of Lindanise. In 1248 Reval received full town rights and adopted the L\u00fcbeck law. The Hanseatic League controlled trade on the Baltic Sea, and overall the four largest towns in Estonia became members: Reval, Dorpat (Tartu), Pernau (P\u00e4rnu), and Fellin (Viljandi). Reval acted as a trade intermediary between Novgorod and Western Hanseatic cities, while Dorpat filled the same role with Pskov. Many guilds were formed during that period, but only a very few allowed the participation of native Estonians. Protected by their stone walls and alliance with the Hansa, prosperous cities like Reval and Dorpat repeatedly defied other rulers of Livonia. After the decline of the Teutonic Order after its defeat in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, and the defeat of the Livonian Order in the Battle of Swienta on 1 September 1435, the Livonian Confederation Agreement was signed on 4 December 1435.<br \/>\nAs a result of the crusade, Baltic Germans played a role in the history of Estonia until 1945.<br \/>\nThe Reformation in Europe began in 1517, and soon spread to Livonia despite opposition by the Livonian Order. Towns were the first to embrace Protestantism in the 1520s, and by the 1530s the majority of the gentry had adopted Lutheranism for themselves and their peasant serfs. Church services were now conducted in vernacular language, which initially meant German, but in the 1530s the first religious services in Estonian also took place.<br \/>\nDuring the 16th century, the expansionist monarchies of Muscowy, Sweden, and Poland\u2013Lithuania consolidated power, posing a growing threat to decentralised Livonia weakened by disputes between cities, nobility, bishops, and the Order.<br \/>\n<strong>Swedish Era. <\/strong>In 1558, Tsar Ivan the Terrible of Russia invaded Livonia, starting the Livonian War. The Livonian Order was decisively defeated in 1560, prompting Livonian factions to seek foreign protection. The majority of Livonia accepted Polish rule, while Reval and the nobles of Northern Estonia swore loyalty to the Swedish king, and the Bishop of \u00d6sel-Wiek sold his lands to the Danish king. Russian forces gradually conquered the majority of Livonia, but in the late 1570s the Polish-Lithuanian and Swedish armies started their own offensives and the bloody war finally ended in 1583 with Russian defeat. As result of the war, Northern Estonia became Swedish Duchy of Estonia, Southern Estonia became Polish Duchy of Livonia, and Saaremaa remained under Danish control.<br \/>\nIn 1600, the Polish-Swedish War broke out, causing further devastation. The protracted war ended in 1629 with Sweden gaining Livonia, including the regions of Southern Estonia and Northern Latvia. Danish Saaremaa was transferred to Sweden in 1645. The wars had halved the Estonian population from about 250\u2013270,000 people in the mid 16th century to 115\u2013120,000 in the 1630s.<br \/>\nWhile serfdom was retained under Swedish rule, legal reforms took place which strengthened peasants&#8217; land usage and inheritance rights, resulting this period&#8217;s reputation of the &#8220;Good Old Swedish Time&#8221; in people&#8217;s historical memory. Swedish king Gustaf II Adolf established gymnasiums in Reval and Dorpat; the latter was upgraded to Tartu University in 1632. Printing presses were also established in both towns. In the 1680s the beginnings of Estonian elementary education appeared, largely due to efforts of Bengt Gottfried Forselius, who also introduced orthographical reforms to written Estonian. The population of Estonia grew rapidly for a 60\u201370-year period, until the Great Famine of 1695\u201397 in which some 70,000\u201375,000 people perished\u00a0\u2013 about 20% of the population.<br \/>\n<strong>Russian Era and National Awakening. <\/strong>In 1700, the Great Northern War started, and by 1710 the whole of Estonia was conquered by the Russian Empire. The war again devastated the population of Estonia, with the 1712 population estimated at only 150,000\u2013170,000. Russian administration restored all the political and landholding rights of Baltic Germans. The rights of Estonian peasants reached their lowest point, as serfdom completely dominated agricultural relations during the 18th century. Serfdom was formally abolished in 1816\u20131819, but this initially had very little practical effect; major improvements in rights of the peasantry started with reforms in the mid-19th century.<br \/>\nThe Estonian national awakening began in the 1850s as the leading figures started promoting an Estonian national identity among the general populace. Its economic basis was formed by widespread farm buyouts by peasants, forming a class of Estonian landowners. In 1857 Johann Voldemar Jannsen started publishing the first Estonian language newspaper and began popularising the denomination of oneself as eestlane (Estonian). Schoolmaster Carl Robert Jakobson and clergyman Jakob Hurt became leading figures in a national movement, encouraging Estonian peasants to take pride in themselves and in their ethnic identity. The first nationwide movements formed, such as a campaign to establish the Estonian language Alexander School, the founding of the Society of Estonian Literati and the Estonian Students&#8217; Society, and the first national song festival, held in 1869 in Tartu. Linguistic reforms helped to develop the Estonian language.[90] The national epic Kalevipoeg was published in 1862, and 1870 saw the first performances of Estonian theatre. In 1878 a major split happened in the national movement. The moderate wing led by Hurt focused on development of culture and Estonian education, while the radical wing led by Jacobson started demanding increased political and economical rights.<br \/>\nIn the late 19th century the Russification period started, as the central government initiated various administrative and cultural measures to tie Baltic governorates more closely to the empire. The Russian language was used throughout the education system and many Estonian social and cultural activities were suppressed. Still, some administrative changes aimed at reducing power of Baltic German institutions did prove useful to Estonians. In the late 1890s there was a new surge of nationalism with the rise of prominent figures like Jaan T\u00f5nisson and Konstantin P\u00e4ts. In the early 20th century Estonians started taking over control of local governments in towns from Germans.<br \/>\nDuring the 1905 Revolution the first legal Estonian political parties were founded. An Estonian national congress was convened and demanded the unification of Estonian areas into a single autonomous territory and an end to Russification. During the unrest peasants and workers attacked manor houses. The Tsarist government responded with a brutal crackdown; some 500 people were executed and hundreds more were jailed or deported to Siberia.<br \/>\n<strong>Independence. <\/strong>In 1917, after the February Revolution, the governorate of Estonia was expanded to include Estonian speaking areas of Livonia and was granted autonomy, enabling formation of the Estonian Provincial Assembly. Bolsheviks seized power during the October Revolution, and disbanded the Provincial Assembly. However the Provincial Assembly established the Salvation Committee, and during the short interlude between Russian retreat and German arrival, the committee declared the independence of Estonia on 24 February 1918, and formed the Estonian Provisional Government. German occupation immediately followed, but after their defeat in World War I the Germans were forced to hand over power to the Provisional Government on 19 November.<br \/>\nOn 28 November 1918 Soviet Russia invaded, starting the Estonian War of Independence. The Red Army came within 30\u00a0km from Tallinn, but in January 1919, the Estonian Army, led by Johan Laidoner, went on a counter-offensive, ejecting Bolshevik forces from Estonia within a few months. Renewed Soviet attacks failed, and in spring, the Estonian army, in cooperation with White Russian forces, advanced into Russia and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Latvia\">Latvia<\/a>. In June 1919, Estonia defeated the German Landeswehr which had attempted to dominate Latvia, restoring power to the government of K\u0101rlis Ulmanis there. After the collapse of the White Russian forces, the Red Army launched a major offensive against Narva in late 1919, but failed to achieve a breakthrough. On 2 February 1920, the Tartu Peace Treaty was signed between Estonia and Soviet Russia, with the latter pledging to permanently give up all sovereign claims to Estonia.<br \/>\nIn April 1919, the Estonian Constituent Assembly was elected. The Constituent Assembly passed a sweeping land reform expropriating large estates, and adopted a new highly liberal constitution establishing Estonia as a parliamentary democracy. In 1924, the Soviet Union organized a communist coup attempt, which quickly failed. Estonia&#8217;s cultural autonomy law for ethnic minorities, adopted in 1925, is widely recognized as one of the most liberal in the world at that time. The Great Depression put heavy pressure on Estonia&#8217;s political system, and in 1933, the right-wing Vaps movement spearheaded a constitutional reform establishing a strong presidency. On 12 March 1934 the acting head of state, Konstantin P\u00e4ts, declared a state of emergency, falsely claiming that the Vaps movement had been planning a coup. P\u00e4ts, together with general Johan Laidoner and Kaarel Eenpalu, established an authoritarian regime, where the parliament was dissolved and the newly established Patriotic League became the only legal political party. In order to legitimize the regime, a new constitution was adopted and elections were held in 1938. Opposition candidates were allowed to participate, but only as independents, while opposition parties remained banned. The P\u00e4ts regime was relatively benign compared to other authoritarian regimes in interwar Europe, and there was no systematic terror against political opponents.<br \/>\nEstonia joined the League of Nations in 1921. Attempts to establish a larger alliance together with Finland, Poland, and Latvia failed, with only a mutual defence pact being signed with Latvia in 1923, and later was followed up with the Baltic Entente of 1934. In the 1930s, Estonia also engaged in secret military cooperation with Finland. Non-aggression pacts were signed with the Soviet Union in 1932, and with Germany in 1939. In 1938, Estonia declared neutrality, but this proved futile in World War II.<br \/>\n<strong>Second World War. <\/strong>On 23 August 1939 Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact. The pact&#8217;s secret protocol divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence, with Estonia belonging to the Soviet sphere. On 24 September, the Soviet Union presented an ultimatum, demanding that Estonia sign a treaty of mutual assistance which would allow Soviet military bases into the country. The Estonian government felt that it had no choice but to comply, and the treaty was signed on 28 September. In May 1940, Red Army forces in bases were set in combat readiness and, on 14 June, the Soviet Union instituted a full naval and air blockade on Estonia. On the same day, the airliner Kaleva was shot down by the Soviet Air Force. On 16 June, Soviets presented an ultimatum demanding completely free passage of the Red Army into Estonia and the establishment of a pro-Soviet government. Feeling that resistance was hopeless, the Estonian government complied and, on the next day, the whole country was occupied. On 6 August 1940, Estonia was annexed by the Soviet Union as the Estonian SSR. The German government initiated a program to relocate most of Estonia&#8217;s Baltic German population to the land of the ancestors.<br \/>\nThe Soviets established a regime of oppression; most of the high-ranking civil and military officials, intelligentsia and industrialists were arrested, and usually executed soon afterwards. Soviet repressions culminated on 14 June 1941 with mass deportation of around 11,000 people to Siberia, among whom more than half perished in inhumane conditions. When the German Operation Barbarossa started against the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, around 34,000 young Estonian men were forcibly drafted into the Red Army, fewer than 30% of whom survived the war. Soviet destruction battalions initiated a scorched earth policy. Political prisoners who could not be evacuated were executed by the NKVD. Many Estonians went into the forest, starting an anti-Soviet guerrilla campaign. In July, German Wehrmacht reached south Estonia. Soviets evacuated Tallinn in late August with massive losses, and capture of the Estonian islands was completed by German forces in October.<br \/>\nInitially many Estonians were hopeful that Germany would help to restore Estonia&#8217;s independence, but this soon proved to be in vain. Only a puppet collaborationist administration was established, and occupied Estonia was merged into Reichskommissariat Ostland, with its economy being fully subjugated to German military needs. About a thousand Estonian Jews who had not managed to leave were almost all quickly killed in 1941. Numerous forced labour camps were established where thousands of Estonians, foreign Jews, Romani, and Soviet prisoners of war perished. German occupation authorities started recruiting men into small volunteer units but, as these efforts provided meagre results and military situation worsened, a forced conscription was instituted in 1943, eventually leading to formation of the Estonian Waffen-SS division. Thousands of Estonians who did not want to fight in German military secretly escaped to Finland, where many volunteered to fight together with Finns against Soviets.<br \/>\nThe Red Army reached the Estonian borders again in early 1944, but its advance into Estonia was stopped in heavy fighting near Narva for six months by German forces, including numerous Estonian units. In March, the Soviet Air Force carried out heavy bombing raids against Tallinn and other Estonian towns. In July, the Soviets started a major offensive from the south, forcing the Germans to abandon mainland Estonia in September, with the Estonian islands being abandoned in November. As German forces were retreating from Tallinn, the last pre-war prime minister J\u00fcri Uluots appointed a government headed by Otto Tief in an unsuccessful attempt restore Estonia&#8217;s independence. Tens of thousands of people, including most of the Estonian Swedes, fled westwards to avoid the new Soviet occupation.<br \/>\nOverall, Estonia lost about 25% of its population through deaths, deportations and evacuations in World War II. Estonia also suffered some irrevocable territorial losses, as Soviet Union transferred border areas comprising about 5% of Estonian pre-war territory from the Estonian SSR to the Russian SFSR.<br \/>\n<strong>Soviet Period. <\/strong>Thousands of Estonians opposing the second Soviet occupation joined a guerrilla movement known as Forest Brothers. The armed resistance was heaviest in the first few years after the war, but Soviet authorities gradually wore it down through attrition, and resistance effectively ceased to exist in the mid 1950s. The Soviets initiated a policy of collectivization, but as peasants remained opposed to it a campaign of terror was unleashed. In March 1949 about 20,000 Estonians were deported to Siberia. Collectivization was fully completed soon afterwards.<br \/>\nThe Soviet Union began Russification, with hundreds of thousands of Russians and people of other Soviet nationalities being induced to settle in Estonia, which eventually threatened to turn Estonians into a minority in their own land. In early 1945 Estonians formed 94% of the population, but by 1989 their share of the population had fallen to 61.5%. Economically, heavy industry was strongly prioritized, but this did not improve the well-being of the local population, and caused massive environmental damage through pollution. Living standards under the Soviet occupation kept falling further behind nearby independent Finland. The country was heavily militarized, with closed military areas covering 2% of territory. Islands and most of the coastal areas were turned into a restricted border zone which required a special permit for entry.<br \/>\nThe United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and the majority of other Western countries considered the annexation of Estonia by the Soviet Union illegal. Legal continuity of the Estonian state was preserved through the government-in-exile and the Estonian diplomatic representatives which Western governments continued to recognize.<br \/>\n<strong>Restoration of Independence. <\/strong>The introduction of Perestroika in 1987 made political activity possible again, starting an independence restoration process known as the Singing Revolution. The environmental Phosphorite War campaign became the first major protest movement against the central government. In 1988 new political movements appeared, such as the Popular Front of Estonia which came to represent the moderate wing in the independence movement, and the more radical Estonian National Independence Party, which was the first non-communist party in the Soviet Union and demanded full restoration of independence. Reformist Vaino V\u00e4ljas became the first secretary of Estonian Communist Party, and under his leadership on 16 November 1988 Estonian Supreme Soviet issued Sovereignty Declaration asserting the primacy of Estonian laws over Union laws. Over the next two years almost all other Soviet Republics followed the Estonian lead issuing similar declarations. On 23 August 1989 about 2 million Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians participated in a mass demonstration forming a Baltic Way human chain across the three republics. In 1990 the Congress of Estonia was formed as representative body of Estonian citizens. In March 1991 a referendum was held where 77.7% of voters supported independence, and during the coup attempt in Moscow Estonia declared restoration of independence on 20 August, which is now the Day of Restoration of Independence, a national holiday.<br \/>\nSoviet authorities recognized Estonian independence on 6 September, and on 17 September Estonia was admitted into the United Nations. The last units of the Russian army left Estonia in 1994.<br \/>\nIn 1992 radical economic reforms were launched for switching over to a market economy, including privatisation and currency reform. Estonian foreign policy since independence has been orientated towards the West, and in 2004 Estonia joined both the European Union and NATO.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GEOGRAPHY<br \/>\n<\/strong>Estonia lies on the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea immediately across the Gulf of Finland, on the level northwestern part of the rising East European platform between 57.3\u00b0 and 59.5\u00b0\u00a0N and 21.5\u00b0 and 28.1\u00b0\u00a0E. Average elevation reaches only 50 metres and the country&#8217;s highest point is the Suur Munam\u00e4gi in the southeast at 318 metres. There is 3,794 kilometres of coastline marked by numerous bays, straits, and inlets. The number of islands and islets is estimated at some 2,355 (including those in lakes). Two of them are large enough to constitute separate counties: Saaremaa and Hiiumaa A small, recent cluster of meteorite craters, the largest of which is called Kaali is found on Saaremaa, Estonia.<br \/>\nEstonia is situated in the northern part of the temperate climate zone and in the transition zone between maritime and continental climate. Estonia has four seasons of near-equal length. Average temperatures range from 16.3\u00a0\u00b0C on the islands to 18.1\u00a0\u00b0C inland in July, the warmest month, and from \u22123.5\u00a0\u00b0C on the islands to \u22127.6\u00a0\u00b0C inland in February, the coldest month. The average annual temperature in Estonia is 5.2\u00a0\u00b0C. The average precipitation in 1961\u20131990 ranged from 535 to 727\u00a0mm (21.1 to 28.6\u00a0in) per year.<br \/>\nSnow cover, which is deepest in the south-eastern part of Estonia, usually lasts from mid-December to late March. Estonia has over 1,400 lakes. Most are very small, with the largest, Lake Peipus, being 3,555\u00a0km2. There are many rivers in the country. The longest of them are V\u00f5handu (162\u00a0km), P\u00e4rnu (144\u00a0km), and P\u00f5ltsamaa (135\u00a0km). Estonia has numerous fens and bogs. Forest land covers 50% of Estonia. The most common tree species are pine, spruce and birch.<br \/>\nPhytogeographically, Estonia is shared between the Central European and Eastern European provinces of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. According to the WWF, the territory of Estonia belongs to the ecoregion of Sarmatic mixed forests.<br \/>\n<strong>Biodiversity. <\/strong>Many species extinct in most of the European countries can be still found in Estonia. Mammals present in Estonia include the grey wolf, lynx, brown bear, red fox, badger, wild boar, moose, red deer, roe deer, beaver, otter, grey seal, and ringed seal. Critically endangered European mink has been successfully reintroduced to the island of Hiiumaa, and the rare Siberian flying squirrel is present in east Estonia. Introduced species, such as the sika deer, raccoon dog and muskrat, can now be found throughout the country. Over 300 bird species have been found in Estonia, including the white-tailed eagle, lesser spotted eagle, golden eagle, western capercaillie, black and white stork, numerous species of owls, waders, geese and many others. The Barn swallow is the national bird of Estonia.<br \/>\nProtected areas cover 18% of Estonian land and 26% of its sea territory. There are 5 national parks, 159 nature reserves, and many other protection areas.<\/p>\n<p><strong>POLITICS<br \/>\n<\/strong>Estonia is a parliamentary representative democratic republic in which the Prime Minister of Estonia is the head of government and which includes a multi-party system. The political culture is stable in Estonia, where power is held between two and three parties that have been in politics for a long time. This situation is similar to other countries in Northern Europe. The former Prime Minister of Estonia, Andrus Ansip, is also the European Union&#8217;s longest-serving Prime Minister (from 2005 until 2014). The current Estonian Prime Minister is J\u00fcri Ratas, who is the former Second Vice-President of the Parliament and the head of the Estonian Centre Party.<br \/>\nParliament. The Parliament of Estonia or the legislative branch is elected by people for a four-year term by proportional representation. The Estonian political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1992 constitutional document. The Estonian parliament has 101 members.<br \/>\nEstonia has pursued the development of the e-state and e-government. Internet voting is used in elections in Estonia. The first internet voting took place in the 2005 local elections and the first in a parliamentary election was made available for the 2007 elections, in which 30,275 individuals voted over the internet. Voters have a chance to invalidate their electronic vote in traditional elections, if they wish to. In 2009 in its eighth Worldwide Press Freedom Index, Reporters Without Borders ranked Estonia sixth out of 175 countries. In the first ever State of World Liberty Index report, Estonia was ranked first out of 159 countries.<br \/>\n<strong>Foreign relations.<br \/>\n<\/strong>Estonia was a member of the League of Nations from 22 September 1921, and became a member of the United Nations on 17 September 1991. Since restoration of independence Estonia has pursued close relations with the Western countries, and has been member of NATO since 29 March 2004, as well as the European Union since 1 May 2004. In 2007, Estonia joined the Schengen Area, and in 2011 the Eurozone. The European Union Agency for large-scale IT systems is based in Tallinn, which started operations at the end of 2012. Estonia held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union in the second half of 2017.<br \/>\nRelations with Russia remain generally cold, though there is some practical cooperation.<br \/>\n<strong>Military.<br \/>\n<\/strong>The military of Estonia is based upon the Estonian Defence Forces (Estonian: Kaitsev\u00e4gi), which is the name of the unified armed forces of the republic with Maav\u00e4gi (Army), Merev\u00e4gi (Navy), \u00d5huv\u00e4gi (Air Force) and a paramilitary national guard organisation Kaitseliit (Defence League).<br \/>\nThe current national military service is compulsory for men between 18 and 28, and conscripts serve eight-month to eleven-month tours of duty depending on the army branch they serve in. Estonia has retained conscription unlike Latvia and Lithuania and has no plan to transition to a professional army. In 2008, annual military spending reached 1.85% of GDP, or 5\u00a0billion kroons, and was expected to continue to increase until 2010, when a 2.0% level was anticipated.<br \/>\nIn January 2008, the Estonian military had almost 300 troops stationed in foreign countries as part of various international peacekeeping forces, including 35 Defence League troops stationed in Kosovo; 120 Ground Forces soldiers in the NATO-led ISAF force in Afghanistan; 80 soldiers stationed as a part of MNF in Iraq; and 2 Estonian officers in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 2 Estonian military agents in Israeli occupied Golan Heights.<br \/>\nThe Estonian Defence Forces have also previously had military missions in Croatia from March until October 1995, in Lebanon from December 1996 until June 1997 and in Macedonia from May until December 2003. Estonia participates in the Nordic Battlegroup and has announced readiness to send soldiers also to Sudan to Darfur if necessary, creating the first African peacekeeping mission for the armed forces of Estonia.<br \/>\nThe Ministry of Defence and the Defence Forces have been working on a cyberwarfare and defence formation for some years now. In 2007, a military doctrine of an e-military of Estonia was officially introduced as the country was under massive cyberattacks in 2007. The proposed aim of the e-military is to secure the vital infrastructure and e-infrastructure of Estonia. The main cyber warfare facility is the Computer Emergency Response Team of Estonia (CERT), founded in 2006. The organisation operates on security issues in local networks.<br \/>\nThen President of the US, George W. Bush, announced his support of Estonia as the location of a NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in 2007. In the aftermath of the 2007 cyberattacks, plans to combine network defence with Estonian military doctrine have been nicknamed as the Tiger&#8217;s Defence, in reference to Tiigrih\u00fcpe. The CCDCOE started its operations in November 2008.[215]<\/p>\n<p><strong>ECONOMY<br \/>\n<\/strong>As a member of the European Union, Estonia is considered a high-income economy by the World Bank. The GDP (PPP) per capita of the country was $29,312 in 2016 according to the International Monetary Fund. Because of its rapid growth, Estonia has often been described as a Baltic Tiger beside Lithuania and Latvia. Beginning 1 January 2011, Estonia adopted the euro and became the 17th eurozone member state.<br \/>\nAccording to Eurostat, Estonia had the lowest ratio of government debt to GDP among EU countries at 6.7% at the end of 2010. A balanced budget, almost non-existent public debt, flat-rate income tax, free trade regime, competitive commercial banking sector, innovative e-Services and even mobile-based services are all hallmarks of Estonia&#8217;s market economy.<br \/>\nEstonia produces about 75% of its consumed electricity. In 2011, about 85% of it was generated with locally mined oil shale. Alternative energy sources such as wood, peat, and biomass make up approximately 9% of primary energy production. Renewable wind energy was about 6% of total consumption in 2009. Estonia imports petroleum products from western Europe and Russia. Estonia imports 100% of its natural gas from Russia. Oil shale energy, telecommunications, textiles, chemical products, banking, services, food and fishing, timber, shipbuilding, electronics, and transportation are key sectors of the economy. The ice-free port of Muuga, near Tallinn, is a modern facility featuring good transshipment capability, a high-capacity grain elevator, chill\/frozen storage, and new oil tanker off-loading capabilities. The railroad serves as a conduit between the West, Russia, and other points to the East.<br \/>\nBecause of the global economic recession that began in 2007, the GDP of Estonia decreased by 1.4% in the 2nd quarter of 2008, over 3% in the 3rd quarter of 2008, and over 9% in the 4th quarter of 2008. The Estonian government made a supplementary negative budget, which was passed by Riigikogu. The revenue of the budget was decreased for 2008 by EEK 6.1\u00a0billion and the expenditure by EEK 3.2\u00a0billion. In 2010, the economic situation stabilised and started a growth based on strong exports. In the fourth quarter of 2010, Estonian industrial output increased by 23% compared to the year before. The country has been experiencing economic growth ever since.<br \/>\nAccording to Eurostat data, Estonian PPS GDP per capita stood at 67% of the EU average in 2008. In 2017, the average monthly gross salary in Estonia was \u20ac1221.<br \/>\nHowever, there are vast disparities in GDP between different areas of Estonia; currently, over half of the country&#8217;s GDP is created in Tallinn. In 2008, the GDP per capita of Tallinn stood at 172% of the Estonian average, which makes the per capita GDP of Tallinn as high as 115% of the European Union average, exceeding the average levels of other counties.<br \/>\nThe unemployment rate in March 2016 was 6.4%, which is below the EU average, while real GDP growth in 2011 was 8.0%, five times the euro-zone average. In 2012, Estonia remained the only euro member with a budget surplus, and with a national debt of only 6%, it is one of the least indebted countries in Europe.<br \/>\n<strong>Economic indicators.<\/strong> Estonia&#8217;s economy continues to benefit from a transparent government and policies that sustain a high level of economic freedom, ranking 6th globally and 2nd in Europe. The rule of law remains strongly buttressed and enforced by an independent and efficient judicial system. A simplified tax system with flat rates and low indirect taxation, openness to foreign investment, and a liberal trade regime have supported the resilient and well-functioning economy. As of May\u00a02018, the Ease of Doing Business Index by the World Bank Group places the country 16th in the world. The strong focus on the IT sector has led to much faster, simpler and efficient public services where for example filing a tax return takes less than five minutes and 98% of banking transactions are conducted through the internet. Estonia has the third lowest business bribery risk in the world, according to TRACE Matrix.<br \/>\n<strong>Resources.<br \/>\n<\/strong>The oil shale industry in Estonia is one of the most developed in the world.[243] In 2012, oil shale supplied 70% of Estonia&#8217;s total primary energy and accounted for 4% of Estonia&#8217;s gross domestic product.<br \/>\nAlthough Estonia is in general resource-poor, the land still offers a large variety of smaller resources. The country has large oil shale and limestone deposits, along with forests that cover 48% of the land. In addition to oil shale and limestone, Estonia also has large reserves of phosphorite, pitchblende, and granite that currently are not mined, or not mined extensively.<br \/>\nSignificant quantities of rare-earth oxides are found in tailings accumulated from 50 years of uranium ore, shale and loparite mining at Sillam\u00e4e. Because of the rising prices of rare earths, extraction of these oxides has become economically viable. The country currently exports around 3000 tonnes per annum, representing around 2% of world production.<br \/>\nSince 2008, public debate has discussed whether Estonia should build a nuclear power plant to secure energy production after closure of old units in the Narva Power Plants, if they are not reconstructed by the year 2016.<br \/>\n<strong>Industry and environment<br \/>\n<\/strong>Food, construction, and electronic industries are currently among the most important branches of Estonia&#8217;s industry. In 2007, the construction industry employed more than 80,000 people, around 12% of the entire country&#8217;s workforce. Another important industrial sector is the machinery and chemical industry, which is mainly located in Ida-Viru County and around Tallinn.<br \/>\nThe oil shale-based mining industry, which is also concentrated in East-Estonia, produces around 90% of the entire country&#8217;s electricity. Although the amount of pollutants emitted to the air have been falling since the 1980s, the air is still polluted with sulphur dioxide from the mining industry that the Soviet Union rapidly developed in the early 1950s. In some areas the coastal seawater is polluted, mainly around the Sillam\u00e4e industrial complex.<br \/>\nEstonia is a dependent country in the terms of energy and energy production. In recent years many local and foreign companies have been investing in renewable energy sources. The importance of wind power has been increasing steadily in Estonia and currently the total amount of energy production from wind is nearly 60 MW while at the same time roughly 399\u00a0MW worth of projects are currently being developed and more than 2800\u00a0MW worth of projects are being proposed in the Lake Peipus area and the coastal areas of Hiiumaa.<br \/>\nCurrently, there are plans to renovate some older units of the Narva Power Plants, establish new power stations, and provide higher efficiency in oil shale-based energy production.[258] Estonia liberalised 35% of its electricity market in April 2010. The electricity market as whole will be liberalised by 2013.<br \/>\nTogether with Lithuania, Poland, and Latvia, the country considered participating in constructing the Visaginas nuclear power plant in Lithuania to replace the Ignalina. However, due to the slow pace of the project and problems with the sector (like Fukushima disaster and bad example of Olkiluoto plant), Eesti Energia has shifted its main focus to shale oil production that is seen as much more profitable business.<br \/>\nEstonia has a strong information technology sector, partly owing to the Tiigrih\u00fcpe project undertaken in the mid-1990s, and has been mentioned as the most &#8220;wired&#8221; and advanced country in Europe in the terms of e-Government of Estonia. A new direction is to offer those services present in Estonia to the non-residents via e-residency program.<br \/>\nSkype was written by Estonia-based developers Ahti Heinla, Priit Kasesalu, and Jaan Tallinn, who had also originally developed Kazaa. Other notable tech startups include GrabCAD, Fortumo and TransferWise. It is even claimed that Estonia has the most startups per person in world.<br \/>\n<strong>Trade<br \/>\n<\/strong>Estonia has had a market economy since the end of the 1990s and one of the highest per capita income levels in Eastern Europe. Proximity to the Scandinavian and Finnish markets, its location between the East and West, competitive cost structure and a highly skilled labour force have been the major Estonian comparative advantages in the beginning of the 2000s. As the largest city, Tallinn has emerged as a financial centre and the Tallinn Stock Exchange joined recently with the OMX system. Several cryptocurrency trading platforms are officially recognized by the government, such as CoinMetro. The current government has pursued tight fiscal policies, resulting in balanced budgets and low public debt.<br \/>\nIn 2007, however, a large current account deficit and rising inflation put pressure on Estonia&#8217;s currency, which was pegged to the Euro, highlighting the need for growth in export-generating industries. Estonia exports mainly machinery and equipment, wood and paper, textiles, food products, furniture, and metals and chemical products. Estonia also exports 1.562\u00a0billion kilowatt hours of electricity annually. At the same time Estonia imports machinery and equipment, chemical products, textiles, food products and transportation equipment. Estonia imports 200\u00a0million kilowatt hours of electricity annually.<br \/>\nBetween 2007 and 2013, Estonia received 53.3\u00a0billion kroons (3.4\u00a0billion euros) from various European Union Structural Funds as direct supports, creating the largest foreign investments into Estonia. Majority of the European Union financial aid will be invested into the following fields: energy economies, entrepreneurship, administrative capability, education, information society, environment protection, regional and local development, research and development activities, healthcare and welfare, transportation and labour market. Main sources of foreign direct investments to Estonia are Sweden and Finland (As of 31\u00a0December\u00a02016 48.3%).<\/p>\n<p><strong>DEMOGRAPHICS<br \/>\n<\/strong>Before World War II, ethnic Estonians constituted 88% of the population, with national minorities constituting the remaining 12%. The largest minority groups in 1934 were Russians, Germans, Swedes, Latvians, Jews, Poles, Finns and Ingrians.<br \/>\nThe share of Baltic Germans in Estonia had fallen from 5.3% (~46,700) in 1881 to 1.3% (16,346) by the year 1934, which was mainly due to emigration to Germany in the light of general Russification in the end of the 19th century and the independence of Estonia in the 20th century.<br \/>\nBetween 1945 and 1989, the share of ethnic Estonians in the population resident within the currently defined boundaries of Estonia dropped to 61%, caused primarily by the Soviet programme promoting mass immigration of urban industrial workers from Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, as well as by wartime emigration and Joseph Stalin&#8217;s mass deportations and executions. By 1989, minorities constituted more than one-third of the population, as the number of non-Estonians had grown almost fivefold.<br \/>\nAt the end of the 1980s, Estonians perceived their demographic change as a national catastrophe. This was a result of the migration policies essential to the Soviet Nationalisation Programme aiming to russify Estonia \u2013 administrative and military immigration of non-Estonians from the USSR coupled with the deportation of Estonians to the USSR. In the decade after the reconstitution of independence, large-scale emigration by ethnic Russians and the removal of the Russian military bases in 1994 caused the proportion of ethnic Estonians in Estonia to increase from 61% to 69% in 2006.<br \/>\nModern Estonia is a fairly ethnically heterogeneous country, but this heterogeneity is not a feature of much of the country as the non-Estonian population is concentrated in two of Estonia&#8217;s counties. Thirteen of Estonia&#8217;s 15 counties are over 80% ethnic Estonian, the most homogeneous being Hiiumaa, where Estonians account for 98.4% of the population. In the counties of Harju (including the capital city, Tallinn) and Ida-Viru, however, ethnic Estonians make up 60% and 20% of the population, respectively. Russians make up 25.6% of the total population but account for 36% of the population in Harju county and 70% of the population in Ida-Viru county.<br \/>\nThe Estonian Cultural Autonomy law that was passed in 1925 was unique in Europe at that time. Cultural autonomies could be granted to minorities numbering more than 3,000 people with longstanding ties to the Republic of Estonia. Before the Soviet occupation, the Germans and Jewish minorities managed to elect a cultural council. The Law on Cultural Autonomy for National Minorities was reinstated in 1993. Historically, large parts of Estonia&#8217;s northwestern coast and islands have been populated by indigenous ethnically Rannarootslased (Coastal Swedes).<br \/>\nIn recent years the numbers of Coastal Swedes has risen again, numbering in 2008 almost 500 people, owing to the property reforms in the beginning of the 1990s. In 2004, the Ingrian Finnish minority in Estonia elected a cultural council and was granted cultural autonomy. The Estonian Swedish minority similarly received cultural autonomy in 2007.<br \/>\n<strong>Society<br \/>\n<\/strong>Estonian society has undergone considerable changes over the last twenty years, one of the most notable being the increasing level of stratification, and the distribution of family income. The Gini coefficient has been steadily higher than the European Union average (31 in 2009), although it has clearly dropped. The registered unemployment rate in January 2012 was 7.7%.<br \/>\nModern Estonia is a multinational country in which 109 languages are spoken, according to a 2000 census. 67.3% of Estonian citizens speak Estonian as their native language, 29.7% Russian, and 3% speak other languages. As of 2\u00a0July\u00a02010, 84.1% of Estonian residents are Estonian citizens, 8.6% are citizens of other countries and 7.3% are &#8220;citizens with undetermined citizenship&#8221;. Since 1992 roughly 140,000 people have acquired Estonian citizenship by passing naturalisation exams. Estonia has also accepted quota refugees under the migrant plan agreed upon by EU member states in 2015.<br \/>\nThe ethnic distribution in Estonia is very homogeneous, where in most counties over 90% of the people are ethnic Estonians. This is in contrast to large urban centres like Tallinn, where Estonians account for 60% of the population, and the remainder is composed mostly of Russian and other Slavic inhabitants, who arrived in Estonia during the Soviet period.<br \/>\nThe 2008 United Nations Human Rights Council report called &#8220;extremely credible&#8221; the description of the citizenship policy of Estonia as &#8220;discriminatory&#8221;. According to surveys, only 5% of the Russian community have considered returning to Russia in the near future. Estonian Russians have developed their own identity \u2013 more than half of the respondents recognised that Estonian Russians differ noticeably from the Russians in Russia. When comparing the result with a survey from 2000, then Russians&#8217; attitude toward the future is much more positive.<br \/>\nEstonia has been the first post-Soviet republic that has legalised civil unions of same-sex couples. The law was approved in October 2014 and came into effect 1 January 2016.<br \/>\n53.3% of ethnically Estonian youth consider belonging in the Nordic identity group as important or very important for them. 52.2% have the same attitude towards the &#8220;Baltic&#8221; identity group, according to a research study from 2013:<br \/>\nThe image that Estonian youths have of their identity is rather similar to that of the Finns as far as the identities of being a citizen of one\u2019s own country, a Fenno-Ugric person, or a Nordic person are concerned, while our identity as a citizen of Europe is common ground between us and Latvians \u2013 being stronger here than it is among the young people of Finland and Sweden.<br \/>\n<strong>Urbanization<br \/>\n<\/strong>Tallinn is the capital and the largest city of Estonia, and lies on the northern coast of Estonia, along the Gulf of Finland. There are 33 cities and several town-parish towns in the country. In total, there are 47 linna, with &#8220;linn&#8221; in English meaning both &#8220;cities&#8221; and &#8220;towns&#8221;. More than 70% of the population lives in towns.<br \/>\n<strong>Religion<\/strong><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\" width=\"116\">Religion<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"123\">2000 Census<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"123\">2011 Census<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"53\">Number<\/td>\n<td width=\"27\">%<\/td>\n<td width=\"53\">Number<\/td>\n<td width=\"27\">%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"131\">Orthodox Christians<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">143,554<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">12.80<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">176,773<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">16.15<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"131\">Lutheran Christians<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">152,237<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">13.57<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">108,513<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">9.91<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"131\">Baptists<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">6,009<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">0.54<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">4,507<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">0.41<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"131\">Roman Catholics<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">5,745<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">0.51<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">4,501<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">0.41<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"131\">Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">3,823<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">0.34<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">3,938<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">0.36<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"131\">Old Believers<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">2,515<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">0.22<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">2,605<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">0.24<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"131\">Christian Free<\/p>\n<p>Congregations<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">223<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">0.02<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">2,189<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">0.20<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"131\">Earth Believers<\/td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\" width=\"68\">1,058<\/td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\" width=\"43\">0.09<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">1,925<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">0.18<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"131\">Taara Believers<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">1,047<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">0.10<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"131\">Pentecostals<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">2,648<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">0.24<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">1,855<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">0.17<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"131\">Muslims<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">1,387<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">0.12<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">1,508<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">0.14<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"131\">Adventists<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">1,561<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">0.14<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">1,194<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">0.11<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"131\">Buddhists<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">622<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">0.06<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">1,145<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">0.10<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"131\">Methodists<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">1,455<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">0.13<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">1,098<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">0.10<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"131\">Other religion<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">4,995<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">0.45<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">8,074<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">0.74<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"131\">No religion<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">450,458<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">40.16<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">592,588<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">54.14<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"131\">Undeclared<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">343,292<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">30.61<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">181,104<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">16.55<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"131\">Total1<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">1,121,582<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">100.00<\/td>\n<td width=\"68\">1,094,564<\/td>\n<td width=\"43\">100.00<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>Estonia has a rich and diverse religious history, but in recent years it has become increasingly secular, with either a plurality or a majority of the population declaring themselves nonreligious in recent censuses, followed by those who identify as religiously &#8220;undeclared&#8221;. The largest minority groups are the various Christian denominations, principally Lutheran and Orthodox Christians, with very small numbers of adherents in non-Christian faiths, namely Judaism, Islam and Buddhism. Other polls suggest the country is broadly split between Christians and the non-religious \/ religiously undeclared.<br \/>\nIn ancient Estonia, prior to Christianization and according to Livonian Chronicle of Henry, Tharapita was the predominant deity for the Oeselians.<br \/>\nEstonia was Christianised by the Catholic Teutonic Knights in the 13th century. The Protestant Reformation led to the establishment of the Lutheran church in 1686. Before the Second World War, Estonia was approximately 80% Protestant, overwhelmingly Lutheran, followed by Calvinism and other Protestant branches. Many Estonians profess not to be particularly religious, because religion through the 19th century was associated with German feudal rule. There has historically been a small but noticeable minority of Russian Old-believers near the Lake Peipus area in Tartu County.<br \/>\nToday, Estonia&#8217;s constitution guarantees freedom of religion, separation of church and state, and individual rights to privacy of belief and religion. According to the Dentsu Communication Institute Inc, Estonia is one of the least religious countries in the world, with 75.7% of the population claiming to be irreligious. The Eurobarometer Poll 2005 found that only 16% of Estonians profess a belief in a god, the lowest belief of all countries studied. According to the Lutheran World Federation, the historic Lutheran denomination has a large presence with 180,000 registered members.<br \/>\nNew polls about religiosity in the European Union in 2012 by Eurobarometer found that Christianity is the largest religion in Estonia accounting for 45% of Estonians. Eastern Orthodox are the largest Christian group in Estonia, accounting for 17% of Estonia citizens, while Protestants make up 6%, and Other Christian make up 22%. Non believer\/Agnostic account 22%, Atheist accounts for 15%, and undeclared accounts for 15%.<br \/>\nThe most recent Pew Research Center, found that in 2015, 51% of the population of Estonia declared itself Christian, 45% religiously unaffiliated\u2014a category which includes atheists, agnostics and those who describe their religion as &#8220;Nothing in Particular&#8221;, while 2% belonged to other faiths. The Christians divided between 25% Eastern Orthodox, 20% Lutherans, 5% other Christians and 1% Roman Catholic. While the religiously unaffiliated divided between 9% as atheists, 1% as agnostics and 35% as Nothing in Particular.<br \/>\nTraditionally, the largest religious denomination in the country was Lutheranism, which was adhered to by 160,000 Estonians (or 13% of the population) according from 2000 census, principally ethnic Estonians. Other organisations, such as the World Council of Churches, report that there are as many as 265,700 Estonian Lutherans. Additionally, there are between 8,000\u20139,000 members abroad. However, the 2011 census indicated that Eastern Orthodoxy had surpassed Lutheranism, accounting for 16.5% of the population (176,773 people).<br \/>\nEastern Orthodoxy is practised chiefly by the Russian minority. The Estonian Orthodox Church, affiliated with the Russian Orthodox Church, is the primary Orthodox denomination. The Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church, under the Greek-Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarchate, claims another 20,000 members. Thus, the number of adherents of Lutheranism and Orthodoxy, without regard to citizenship or ethnicity, is roughly equal.<br \/>\nRoman Catholics are a small minority in Estonia. They are organized under the Latin Apostolic Administration of Estonia.<br \/>\nAccording to the census of 2000 (data in table to the right), there were about 1,000 adherents of the Taara faith or Maausk in Estonia. The Jewish community has an estimated population of about 1,900, and the Muslim community numbers just over 1,400. Around 68,000 people consider themselves atheists.<br \/>\n<strong>Languages<br \/>\n<\/strong>The official language, Estonian, belongs to the Finnic branch of the Uralic languages. Estonian is closely related to Finnish, spoken in Finland, across the other side of the Gulf of Finland, and is one of the few languages of Europe that is not of an Indo-European origin. Despite some overlaps in the vocabulary due to borrowings, in terms of its origin, Estonian and Finnish are not related to their nearest geographical neighbours, Swedish, Latvian, and Russian, which are all Indo-European languages.<br \/>\nAlthough the Estonian and Germanic languages are of very different origins, one can identify many similar words in Estonian and German, for example. This is primarily because the Estonian language has borrowed nearly one third of its vocabulary from Germanic languages, mainly from Low Saxon (Middle Low German) during the period of German rule, and High German (including standard German). The percentage of Low Saxon and High German loanwords can be estimated at 22\u201325 percent, with Low Saxon making up about 15 percent.<br \/>\nSouth Estonian languages are spoken by 100,000 people and include the dialects of V\u00f5ro and Seto. The languages are spoken in South-Eastern Estonia, are genealogically distinct from northern Estonian: but are traditionally and officially considered as dialects and &#8220;regional forms of the Estonian language&#8221;, not separate language(s).<br \/>\nRussian is still spoken as a secondary language by forty- to seventy-year-old ethnic Estonians, because Russian was the unofficial language of the Estonian SSR from 1944 to 1991 and taught as a compulsory second language during the Soviet era. In 1998, most first- and second-generation industrial immigrants from the former Soviet Union (mainly the Russian SFSR) did not speak Estonian. However, by 2010, 64.1% of non-ethnic Estonians spoke Estonian. The latter, mostly Russian-speaking ethnic minorities, reside predominantly in the capital city of Tallinn and the industrial urban areas in Ida-Virumaa.<br \/>\nFrom the 13th to the 20th century, there were Swedish-speaking communities in Estonia, particularly in the coastal areas and on the islands (e.g., Hiiumaa, Vormsi, Ruhnu; in Swedish, known as Dag\u00f6, Orms\u00f6, Run\u00f6, respectively) along the Baltic sea, communities which today have almost disappeared. The Swedish-speaking minority was represented in parliament, and entitled to use their native language in parliamentary debates.From 1918 to 1940, when Estonia was independent, the small Swedish community was well treated. Municipalities with a Swedish majority, mainly found along the coast, used Swedish as the administrative language and Swedish-Estonian culture saw an upswing. However, most Swedish-speaking people fled to Sweden before the end of World War II, that is, before the invasion of Estonia by the Soviet army in 1944. Only a handful of older speakers remain. Apart from many other areas the influence of Swedish is especially distinct in the Noarootsi Parish of L\u00e4\u00e4ne County where there are many villages with bilingual Estonian and\/or Swedish names and street signs.<br \/>\nThe most common foreign languages learned by Estonian students are English, Russian, German, and French. Other popular languages include Finnish, Spanish, and Swedish.<br \/>\n<strong>Education and science<br \/>\n<\/strong>The history of formal education in Estonia dates back to the 13th and 14th centuries when the first monastic and cathedral schools were founded. The first primer in the Estonian language was published in 1575. The oldest university is the University of Tartu, established by the Swedish king Gustav II Adolf in 1632. In 1919, university courses were first taught in the Estonian language.<br \/>\nAccording to the Programme for International Student Assessment, the performance levels of gymnasium-age pupils in Estonia is among the highest in the world: in 2010, the country was ranked 13th for the quality of its education system, well above the OECD average. Additionally, around 89% of Estonian adults aged 25\u201364 have earned the equivalent of a high-school degree, one of the highest rates in the industrialised world.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CULTURE<br \/>\n<\/strong>The culture of Estonia incorporates indigenous heritage, as represented by the Estonian language and the sauna, with mainstream Nordic and European cultural aspects. Because of its history and geography, Estonia&#8217;s culture has been influenced by the traditions of the adjacent area&#8217;s various Finnic, Baltic, Slavic and Germanic peoples as well as the cultural developments in the former dominant powers Sweden and Russia.<br \/>\nToday, Estonian society encourages liberty and liberalism, with popular commitment to the ideals of the limited government, discouraging centralised power and corruption. The Protestant work ethic remains a significant cultural staple, and free education is a highly prized institution. Like the mainstream culture in the other Nordic countries, Estonian culture can be seen to build upon the ascetic environmental realities and traditional livelihoods, a heritage of comparatively widespread egalitarianism out of practical reasons (see: Everyman&#8217;s right and universal suffrage), and the ideals of closeness to nature and self-sufficiency.<br \/>\n<strong>Architecture<br \/>\n<\/strong>The architectural history of Estonia mainly reflects its contemporary development in northern Europe. Worth mentioning is especially the architectural ensemble that makes out the medieval old town of Tallinn, which is on the UNESCO World Heritage List. In addition, the country has several unique, more or less preserved hill forts dating from pre-Christian times, a large number of still intact medieval castles and churches, while the countryside is still shaped by the presence of a vast number of manor houses from earlier centuries.<br \/>\n<strong>Holidays<br \/>\n<\/strong>The Estonian National Day is the Independence Day celebrated on 24 February, the day the Estonian Declaration of Independence was issued. As of 2013, there are 12 public holidays (which come with a day off) and 12 national holidays celebrated annually.<br \/>\n<strong>Cuisine<br \/>\n<\/strong>Historically, the cuisine of Estonia has been heavily dependent on seasons and simple peasant food. Today, it includes many typical international foods. The most typical foods in Estonia are black bread, pork, potatoes, and dairy products. Traditionally in summer and spring, Estonians like to eat everything fresh \u2013 berries, herbs, vegetables, and everything else that comes straight from the garden. Hunting and fishing have also been very common, although currently hunting and fishing are enjoyed mostly as hobbies. Today, it is also very popular to grill outside in summer.<br \/>\nTraditionally in winter, jams, preserves, and pickles are brought to the table. Gathering and conserving fruits, mushrooms, and vegetables for winter has always been popular, but today gathering and conserving is becoming less common because everything can be bought from stores. However, preparing food for winter is still very popular in the countryside.<br \/>\n<strong>Sports<br \/>\n<\/strong>Sport plays an important role in Estonian culture. After declaring independence from Russia in 1918, Estonia first competed as a nation at the 1920 Summer Olympics, although the National Olympic Committee was established in 1923. Estonian athletes took part of the Olympic Games until the country was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940. The 1980 Summer Olympics Sailing regatta was held in the capital city Tallinn. After regaining independence in 1991, Estonia has participated in all Olympics. Estonia has won most of its medals in athletics, weightlifting, wrestling and cross-country skiing. Estonia has had very good success at the Olympic games given the country&#8217;s small population. Estonia&#8217;s best results were being ranked 13th in the medal table at the 1936 Summer Olympics, and 12th at the 2006 Winter Olympics..<br \/>\nPaul Keres, Estonian and Soviet chess grandmaster, was among the world&#8217;s top players from the mid-1930s to the mid-1960s. He narrowly missed a chance at a World Chess Championship match on five occasions.<br \/>\nWrestler Heiki Nabi at 2012 Summer Olympics, wrestling is Estonia&#8217;s most successful Olympic sport.<br \/>\nKiiking, a relatively new sport, was invented in 1996 by Ado Kosk in Estonia. Kiiking involves a modified swing in which the rider of the swing tries to go around 360\u00a0degrees.<br \/>\nBasketball is also a notable sport in Estonia. The domestic top-tier basketball championship is called the Korvpalli Meistriliiga.<\/p>\n<p><strong>International rankings<br \/>\n<\/strong>The following are links to international rankings of Estonia.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"434\">Index<\/td>\n<td width=\"99\">Rank<\/td>\n<td width=\"137\">Countries reviewed<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"434\">Freedom House Internet Freedom 2016<\/td>\n<td width=\"99\">1st<\/td>\n<td width=\"137\">65<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"434\">Ease of doing business index 2017<\/td>\n<td width=\"99\">14th<\/td>\n<td width=\"137\">190<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"434\">Climate Change Performance Index 2018<\/td>\n<td width=\"99\">30th<\/td>\n<td width=\"137\">60<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"434\">Environmental Performance Index 2016<\/td>\n<td width=\"99\">8th<\/td>\n<td width=\"137\">180<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"434\">Global Gender Gap Report Global Gender Gap Index 2015<\/td>\n<td width=\"99\">21st<\/td>\n<td width=\"137\">136<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"434\">Index of Economic Freedom 2017<\/td>\n<td width=\"99\">6th<\/td>\n<td width=\"137\">180<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"434\">International Tax Competitiveness Index 2014\u20132018[346]<\/td>\n<td width=\"99\">1st<\/td>\n<td width=\"137\">35<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"434\">Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index 2011\u20132012<\/td>\n<td width=\"99\">11th<\/td>\n<td width=\"137\">187<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"434\">State of World Liberty Index 2006<\/td>\n<td width=\"99\">1st<\/td>\n<td width=\"137\">159<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"434\">Human Development Index 2015<\/td>\n<td width=\"99\">30th<\/td>\n<td width=\"137\">169<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"434\">Corruption Perceptions Index 2016<\/td>\n<td width=\"99\">22nd<\/td>\n<td width=\"137\">176<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"434\">TRACE Matrix business bribery risk 2016[237]<\/td>\n<td width=\"99\">3rd<\/td>\n<td width=\"137\">199<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"434\">Networked Readiness Index 2014<\/td>\n<td width=\"99\">21st<\/td>\n<td width=\"137\">133<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"434\">Ease of Doing Business Index 2017<\/td>\n<td width=\"99\">12th<\/td>\n<td width=\"137\">190<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"434\">State of The World&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Index 2012[347]<\/td>\n<td width=\"99\">10th<\/td>\n<td width=\"137\">165<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"434\">State of The World&#8217;s Women&#8217;s Index 2012<\/td>\n<td width=\"99\">18th<\/td>\n<td width=\"137\">165<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"434\">World Freedom Index 2014[348]<\/td>\n<td width=\"99\">8th<\/td>\n<td width=\"137\">165<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"434\">Legatum Prosperity Index 2018<\/td>\n<td width=\"99\">26th<\/td>\n<td width=\"137\">149<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"434\">EF English Proficiency Index 2013<\/td>\n<td width=\"99\">4th<\/td>\n<td width=\"137\">60<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"434\">Programme for International Student Assessment 2015 (Maths)<\/td>\n<td width=\"99\">9th<\/td>\n<td width=\"137\">72<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"434\">Programme for International Student Assessment 2015 (Science)<\/td>\n<td width=\"99\">3rd<\/td>\n<td width=\"137\">72<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"434\">Programme for International Student Assessment 2015 (Reading)<\/td>\n<td width=\"99\">6th<\/td>\n<td width=\"137\">72<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Estonia, officially the Republic of Estonia, is a country in Northern Europe.
