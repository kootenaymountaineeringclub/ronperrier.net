Gas Prices<\/strong>. The price of diesel (higher than gas) in Serbia was one of the highest in southern Europe at an average of about 165 SN or \u20ac1.40\/l. The price in Romania was an average of about 5.90 lie\/l or \u20ac1.25\/l.<br \/>\n<strong>2. Rural Romania<\/strong>: Towns lining the highways are common, seemingly forever sometimes, mostly unpainted grey homes with dirty, stained orange tiled roofs, but some towns have many pastel homes, grey churches with one or two high towers and silver roofs and domes, old women in kerchiefs, long dresses and aprons, old men puttering around their homes, many old men and women on bicycles, not many young people except the guys having beer before lunch, small farm tractors and horses pulling carts (many with \u2018momma\u2019 along for the ride) on the highways, incessant stopping for people on crosswalks and more hitchhikers than the rest of Europe combined (often middle-aged women).<br \/>\n<strong>3. Drivers<\/strong> are the usual mix \u2013 speed demons in their BMWs, Audis and Mercedes (apparently Romania is a dumping ground for German cars unable to meet the strict emission rules and too expensive to fix) are all too common, often riding your tail. Most Romanians drive fast and I am passed frequently despite going 15-20kms over the speed limit. They are cautious taking speed bumps at 1km\/hour and slow traffic with trucks, pedestrians and old men.<br \/>\nI eventually became very tired of the fast Romanian drivers. They accelerate hard and brake hard making the worst of any fuel efficiency. There is always someone coming up fast in other lanes making it difficult to change lanes and requiring constant shoulder checks. There are no speed cameras in Romania and only infrequent police radar traps. As a result most Romanian drivers drive at whatever speed they want. It is nothing to see guys going 100 through 30km\/hour speed zones in towns. On the expressway from Bucharest to Constansa, I drove the fastest I have in Europe averaging 140-160kms\/hour and guys were breezing by me. They are very impatient and are constantly flashing their high beams, doing wild lane changes to get by you and tail gating (on 2-lane expressways, I feel no compunction to stay out of the left lane if I am going the speed limit of 130kms\/hour if there are slow vehicles like big trucks ahead). This is not the autobahn &#8211; only possible with at least 3 lanes.<br \/>\n<strong>4. Museums<\/strong> are cheap, usually in the \u20ac1-2 and usually reduced if over 65 (or pensioner).<br \/>\n<strong>5. Storks.<\/strong> Many power poles have huge stork nests, now fledging the chicks with a patient mom very visible. The mothers are very attentive and you never see them off their nests, I have seen several with 3 chicks.<br \/>\n<strong>6<\/strong>.\u00a0<strong>Shepherds.<\/strong> These are amazingly common herding their free range animals along road ways \u2013 sheep, goats, cattle and even a herd of water buffalo. Some herds are big and sometimes they only have a few animals.<br \/>\nI even saw a chicken shepherd. An elderly man on the side of the road was watching over about 15 chickens, all staying together in a tight group. They must have been trained chickens. I have heard of the difficulty of herding cats, and I would think chickens might have the same issues.<br \/>\n<strong>7. Roma.<\/strong> Romania has a large Roma population. A significant number are the ones in carts driven by horses. The kids you see on the street are all barefoot. In Agapia on a Sunday, I saw several Roma. The women (both with significant bellies) were all dressed up in traditional, very nice clothes. In Ia\u0219i, three were hanging around where I parked my van. One had a plastic bag of glue on her face all the time. They often beg with kids on their hip.<br \/>\nTheir houses tend to be separate and in places normal people don&#8217;t live, like ravines &#8211; and are an unbelievable mess with garbage everywhere. A fellow I met in Belgrade told about a Roma man who tried to get an education but quit after one year as his Roma community ostracized him and he never really was accepted into the normal community either.<br \/>\n<strong>8. Crosswalks.<\/strong> I have no problem stopping for crosswalks but Romanian carry it to the extreme. They are very entitled and don\u2019t wait if vehicles are coming, but immediately enter the crosswalk. There are often a stream of people. Delays are long and frequent. I have an issue having to come to a screeching halt and have more than once almost rear-ended the guy in front when he stopped unexpectantly at a crosswalk.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Currency: <\/strong>May 2019: 4.75 Lei = 1\u20ac<\/p>\n<p><strong>SUMMARY<br \/>\n<\/strong>Romania is a country located at the crossroads of Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe. It borders the Black Sea to the southeast, Bulgaria to the south, Ukraine to the north, Hungary to the west, Serbia to the southwest, and Moldova to the east. It has a predominantly temperate-continental climate. With a total area of 238,397 square kilometres, Romania is the 12th largest country and also the 7th most populous member state of the European Union, having almost 20 million inhabitants. Its capital and largest city is Bucharest, and other major urban areas include Cluj-Napoca, Timi\u0219oara, Ia\u0219i, Constan\u021ba, Craiova, and Bra\u0219ov.<br \/>\nThe River Danube, Europe&#8217;s second-longest river, rises in Germany&#8217;s Black Forest and flows in a general southeast direction for 2,857\u00a0km, coursing through ten countries before emptying into Romania&#8217;s Danube Delta. The Carpathian Mountains, which cross Romania from the north to the southwest, include Moldoveanu Peak, at an altitude of 2,544\u00a0m (8,346\u00a0ft).<br \/>\nModern Romania was formed in 1859 through a personal union of the Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia. The new state, officially named Romania since 1866, gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1877. Following World War I, when Romania fought on the side of the Allied powers, Bukovina, Bessarabia, Transylvania as well as parts of Banat, Cri\u0219ana, and Maramure\u0219 became part of the sovereign Kingdom of Romania. In June\u2013August 1940, as a consequence of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact and Second Vienna Award, Romania was compelled to cede Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union, and Northern Transylvania to Hungary. In November 1940, Romania signed the Tripartite Pact and, consequently, in June 1941 entered World War II on the Axis side, fighting against the Soviet Union until August 1944, when it joined the Allies and recovered Northern Transylvania. Following the war, under the occupation of the Red Army&#8217;s forces, Romania became a socialist republic and member of the Warsaw Pact. After the 1989 Revolution, Romania began a transition back towards democracy and a market economy.<br \/>\nThe sovereign state of Romania is a developing country and ranks 52nd in the Human Development Index. It has the world&#8217;s 47th largest economy by nominal GDP and an annual economic growth rate of 7% (2017), the highest in the EU at the time. Following rapid economic growth in the early 2000s, Romania has an economy predominantly based on services, and is a producer and net exporter of machines and electric energy, featuring companies like Automobile Dacia and OMV Petrom. It has been a member of the United Nations since 1955, part of NATO since 2004, and part of the European Union since 2007. An overwhelming majority of the population identifies themselves as Eastern Orthodox Christians and are native speakers of Romanian, a Romance language.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ETYMOLOGY<\/strong><br \/>\nRomania derives from the Latin romanus, meaning &#8220;citizen of Rome&#8221;. The first known use of the appellation was attested to in the 16th century by Italian humanists travelling in Transylvania, Moldavia, and Wallachia.<br \/>\nThe oldest known surviving document written in Romanian, a 1521 letter known as the &#8220;Letter of Neac\u0219u from C\u00e2mpulung&#8221;, is also notable for including the first documented occurrence of the country&#8217;s name.<br \/>\nThe use of the name Romania to refer to the common homeland of all Romanians\u2014its modern-day meaning\u2014was first documented in the early 19th century. The name has been officially in use since 11 December 1861.<br \/>\nA handful of other languages (including Italian, Hungarian, Portuguese, and Norwegian) have also switched to &#8220;o&#8221; like English, but most languages continue to prefer forms with u, e.g. French Roumanie, German and Swedish Rum\u00e4nien, Spanish Rumania (the archaic form Ruman\u00eda is still in use in Spain), Polish Rumunia, Russian \u0420\u0443\u043c\u044b\u043d\u0438\u044f (Rumyniya), and Japanese \u30eb\u30fc\u30de\u30cb\u30a2 (R\u016bmania).<\/p>\n<p><strong>HISTORY<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Prehistory and antiquity.<br \/>\n<\/strong>Human remains found in Pe\u0219tera cu Oase (&#8220;Cave with Bones&#8221;), radiocarbon dated as being from circa 40,000 years ago, represent the oldest known Homo sapiens in Europe. Neolithic techniques and agriculture spread after the arrival of a mixed group of people from Thessaly in the 6th millennium BC. Excavations near a salt spring at Lunca yielded the earliest evidence for salt exploitation in Europe; here the production of salt started between 6050 and 5900 BC. The first permanent settlements also appeared in the Neolithic. Some of them developed into &#8220;proto-cities&#8221;, which were larger than 800 acres. The Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture\u2014the best known archaeological culture of Old Europe\u2014flourished in Muntenia, southeastern Transylvania and northeastern Moldavia in the 3rd millennium BC. The first fortified settlements appeared around 1800 BC, showing the militant character of Bronze Age societies.<br \/>\nGreek colonies established on the Black Sea coast in the 7th century BC became important centers of commerce with the local tribes. Among the native peoples, Herodotus listed the Getae of the Lower Danube region, the Agathyrsi of Transylvania and the Syginnae of the plains along the river Tisza at the beginning of the 5th century BC. Centuries later, Strabo associated the Getae with the Dacians who dominated the lands along the southern Carpathian Mountains in the 1st century BC. Burebista was the first Dacian ruler to unite the local tribes. He also conquered the Greek colonies in Dobruja and the neighboring peoples as far as the Middle Danube and the Balkan Mountains between around 55 and 44 BC. After Burebista was murdered in 44 BC, his empire collapsed.<br \/>\nThe Romans reached Dacia during Burebista&#8217;s reign and conquered Dobruja in 46 AD. Dacia was again united under Decebalus around 85. He resisted the Romans for decades, but the Roman army annihilated his troops in 106. Emperor Trajan transformed Banat, Oltenia and the greater part of Transylvania into the new Roman province of Dacia, but Dacian, Germanic and Sarmatian tribes continued to dominate the lands along the Roman frontiers. The Romans pursued an organized colonization policy and the provincials enjoyed a long period of peace and prosperity in the 2nd century. Scholars accepting the Daco-Roman continuity theory\u2014one of the main theories about the origin of the Romanians\u2014say that the cohabitation of the native Dacians and the Roman colonists in Roman Dacia was the first phase of the Romanians&#8217; ethnogenesis.<br \/>\nThe Carpians, Goths and other neighboring tribes made regular raids against Dacia from the 210s. The Romans could not resist and Emperor Aurelian ordered the evacuation of the province Dacia Trajana in 271. Scholars supporting the continuity theory are convinced that most Latin-speaking commoners stayed behind when the army and civil administration was withdrawn. The Romans did not abandon their fortresses along the northern banks of the Lower Danube for decades, and Dobruja (known as Scythia Minor) remained an integral part of the Roman Empire until the early 7th century.<br \/>\n<strong>Middle Ages. <\/strong>Foundation of Wallachia, and Founding of Moldavia<br \/>\nThe Goths were expanding towards the Lower Danube from the 230s, forcing the native peoples to flee to the Roman Empire or to accept their suzerainty. The Goths&#8217; rule came to an abrupt end when the Huns invaded their territory in 376, causing new waves of migrations. The Huns forced the remnants of the local population into submission, but their empire collapsed in 454. The Gepids took possession of the former Dacia province. The nomadic Avars defeated the Gepids and established a powerful empire around 570. The Bulgars, who also came from the Eurasian steppes, occupied the Lower Danube region in 680. According to scholars who accept the Daco-Roman continuity theory, the Romanians&#8217; ancestors, known by the exonym Vlachs in the Middle Ages, lived in densely forested areas, separated from the Goths, Huns, Gepids and Avars during these centuries.<br \/>\nPlace names of Slavic origin abound in Romania, indicating that a numerous Slavic-speaking population used to live in the territory. The first Slavic groups settled in Moldavia and Wallachia in the 6th century, in Transylvania around 600. After the Avar Khaganate collapsed in the 790s, Bulgaria became the dominant power of the region, occupying lands as far as the river Tisa. The Council of Preslav declared Old Church Slavonic the language of liturgy in the First Bulgarian Empire in 893. The Romanians also adopted Old Church Slavonic as their liturgical language.<br \/>\nThe Magyars (or Hungarians) took control of the steppes north of the Lower Danube in the 830s, but the Bulgarians and the Pechenegs jointly forced them to abandon this region for the lowlands along the Middle Danube around 894. Centuries later, the Gesta Hungarorum wrote of the invading Magyars&#8217; wars against three dukes\u2014Glad, Menumorut and the Vlach Gelou\u2014for Banat, Cri\u0219ana and Transylvania. The Gesta also listed many peoples\u2014Slavs, Bulgarians, Vlachs, Khazars and Sz\u00e9kelys\u2014inhabiting the same regions. The reliability of the Gesta is debated, with some scholars regarding it as a basically accurate account, others describing it as a literary work filled with invented details. The lowlands abandoned by the Hungarians to east of the Carpathians were seized by the Pechenegs.<br \/>\nByzantine missionaries proselytized in the lands east of the Tisa from the 940s and Byzantine troops occupied Dobruja in the 970s. The first king of Hungary, Stephen I, who supported Western European missionaries, defeated the local chieftains and established Roman Catholic bishoprics in Transylvania and Banat in the early 11th century. Significant Pecheneg groups fled to the Byzantine Empire in the 1040s; the Oghuz Turks followed them, and the nomadic Cumans became the dominant power of the steppes in the 1060s. Cooperation between the Cumans and the Vlachs against the Byzantine Empire is well documented from the end of the 11th century. Scholars who reject the Daco-Roman continuity theory say that the first Vlach groups left their Balkan homeland for the mountain pastures of the eastern and southern Carpathians in the 11th century, establishing the Romanians&#8217; presence in the lands to the north of the Lower Danube.<br \/>\nExposed to nomadic incursions, Transylvania developed into an important border province of the Kingdom of Hungary. The Sz\u00e9kelys\u2014a community of free warriors\u2014settled in central Transylvania around 1100, and moved to the easternmost regions around 1200. Colonists from the Holy Roman Empire\u2014the Transylvanian Saxons&#8217; ancestors\u2014came to the province in the 1150s. A high-ranking royal official, styled voivode, ruled the Transylvanian counties from the 1170s, but the Sz\u00e9kely and Saxon seats (or districts) were not subject to the voivodes&#8217; authority. Royal charters wrote of the &#8220;Vlachs&#8217; land&#8221; in southern Transylvania in the early 13th century, indicating the existence of autonomous Romanian communities. Papal correspondence mentioned the activities of Orthodox prelates among the Romanians in Muntenia in the 1230s.<br \/>\nThe Mongols destroyed large territories during their invasion of Eastern and Central Europe in 1241 and 1242. The Mongols&#8217; Golden Horde emerged as the dominant power of Eastern Europe, but B\u00e9la IV of Hungary&#8217;s land grant to the Knights Hospitallers in Oltenia and Muntenia shows that the local Vlach rulers were subject to the king&#8217;s authority in 1247. Basarab I of Wallachia united the Romanian polities between the southern Carpathians and the Lower Danube in the 1310s. He defeated the Hungarian royal army in the Battle of Posada and secured the independence of Wallachia in 1330. The second Romanian principality, Moldavia, achieved full autonomy during the reign of Bogdan I around 1360. A local dynasty ruled the Despotate of Dobruja in the second half of the 14th century, but the Ottoman Empire took possession of the territory after 1388.<br \/>\nVlad III of Wallachia (also known as Vlad the Impaler), medieval ruler of Wallachia<br \/>\nPrinces Mircea I and Vlad III of Wallachia, and Stephen III of Moldavia defended their countries independence against the Ottomans, but most Wallachian and Moldavian princes paid a regular tribute to the Ottoman sultans from 1417 and 1456, respectively. A military commander of Romanian origin, John Hunyadi, organized the defence of the Kingdom of Hungary until his death in 1456. Increasing taxes outraged the Transylvanian peasants and they rose up in an open rebellion in 1437, but the Hungarian nobles and the heads of the Saxon and Sz\u00e9kely communities jointly pushed their revolt. The formal alliance of the Hungarian, Saxon and Sz\u00e9kely leaders, known as the Union of the Three Nations, became an important element of the self-government of Transylvania. The Orthodox Romanian knezes (or chiefs) were excluded from the Union.<br \/>\n<strong>Early Modern Times and national awakening.<br \/>\n<\/strong>The Kingdom of Hungary collapsed and the Ottomans occupied parts of Banat and Cri\u0219ana in 1541. Transylvania and Maramure\u0219, along with the rest of Banat and Cri\u0219ana developed into a new state under Ottoman suzerainty, the Principality of Transylvania. Reformation spread and four denominations\u2014Calvinism, Lutheranism, Unitarianism and Roman Catholicism\u2014were officially acknowledged in 1568. The Romanians&#8217; Orthodox faith remained only tolerated, although they made up more than one-third of the During the Long Turkish War, Wallachian Prince Michael the Brave (portrayed to the right) briefly reigned over the three medieval principalities of Wallachia, Moldavia, and Transylvania, covering most of present-day territory of Romania.<br \/>\nThe princes of Transylvania, Wallachia and Moldavia joined the Holy League against the Ottoman Empire in 1594. The Wallachian prince, Michael the Brave, united the three principalities under his rule in May 1600. The neighboring powers forced him to abdicate in September, but he became a symbol of the unification of the Romanian lands in the 19th century. Although the rulers of the three principalities continued to pay tribute to the Ottomans, the most talented princes\u2014Gabriel Bethlen of Transylvania, Matei Basarab of Wallachia, and Vasile Lupu of Moldavia\u2014strengthened their autonomy.<br \/>\nThe united armies of the Holy League expelled the Ottoman troops from Central Europe between 1684 and 1699 and the Principality of Transylvania was integrated into the Habsburg Empire. The Habsburgs supported the Catholic clergy and persuaded the Orthodox Romanian prelates to accept the union with the Roman Catholic Church in 1699. The Church Union strengthened the Romanian intellectuals&#8217; devotion to their Roman heritage. The Orthodox Church was restored in Transylvania only after Orthodox monks stirred up revolts in 1744 and 1759. The organization of the Transylvanian Military Frontier caused further disturbances, especially among the Sz\u00e9kelys in 1764.<br \/>\nPrinces Dimitrie Cantemir of Moldavia and Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu of Wallachia concluded alliances with the Habsburg Empire and Russia against the Ottomans, but they were dethroned in 1711 and 1714, respectively. The sultans lost confidence in the native princes and appointed Orthodox merchants from the Phanar district of Istanbul to rule Moldova and Wallachia. The Phanariot princes pursued oppressive fiscal policies and dissolved the army. The neighboring powers take advantage of the situation: the Habsburg Empire annexed northern Moldavia, or Bucovina, in 1775, and Russia seized Bessarabia in 1812.<br \/>\nA census revealed that the Romanians were more numerous than any of the other ethnic groups in Transylvania in 1733, but legislation continued to use contemptuous adjectives (such as &#8220;tolerated&#8221; and &#8220;admitted&#8221;) when referring to them. The Uniate bishop, Inocen\u021biu Micu-Klein who demanded the recognition of the Romanians as the fourth privileged nation was forced into exile. Uniate and Orthodox clerics and laymen jointly signed a plea for the Transylvanian Romanians&#8217; emancipation in 1791, but the monarch and the local authorities denied to grant their requests.<br \/>\n<strong>Independence and monarchy. <\/strong>United Principalities, Romanian War of Independence, and Kingdom of Romania.<br \/>\nThe Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca authorized the Russian ambassador in Istanbul to defend the autonomy of Moldavia and Wallachia (known as the Danubian Principalities) in 1774. Taking advantage of the Greek War of Independence, a Wallachian lesser nobleman, Tudor Vladimirescu, stirred up a revolt against the Ottomans in January 1821, but he was murdered in June by Phanariot Greeks. After a new Russo-Turkish War, the Treaty of Adrianople strengthened the autonomy of the Danubian Principalities in 1829, although it also acknowledged the sultan&#8217;s right to confirm the election of the princes.<br \/>\nMihail Kog\u0103lniceanu, Nicolae B\u0103lcescu and other leaders of the 1848 revolutions in Moldavia and Wallachia demanded the emancipation of the peasants and the union of the two principalities, but Russian and Ottoman troops crushed their revolt. The Wallachian revolutionists were the first to adopt the blue, yellow and red tricolor as national flag. In Transylvania, most Romanians supported the imperial government against the Hungarian revolutioners after the Diet passed a law about the union of Transylvania and Hungary. Bishop Andrei \u0218aguna proposed the unification of the Romanians of the Habsburg Empire in a separate duchy, but the central government refused to change the internal frontiers.<br \/>\nThe Treaty of Paris put the Danubian Principalities under the collective guardianship of the Great Powers in 1856. After special assemblies convoked in Moldavia and Wallachia urged the unification of the two principalities, the Great Powers did not prevent the election of Alexandru Ioan Cuza as their collective domnitor (or ruling prince) in January 1859. The united principalities officially adopted the name Romania on 21 February 1862. Cuza&#8217;s government carried out a series of reforms, including the secularization of the property of monasteries and agrarian reform, but a coalition of conservative and radical politicians forced him to abdicate in February 1866.<br \/>\nCuza&#8217;s successor, a German prince, Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen (or Carol I), was elected in May. The parliament adopted the first constitution of Romania in the same year. The Great Powers acknowledged Romania&#8217;s full independence at the Congress of Berlin and Carol I was crowned king in 1881. The Congress also granted the Danube Delta and Dobruja to Romania. Although Romanian scholars strived for the unification of all Romanians into a Greater Romania, the government did not openly support their irredentist projects.<br \/>\nThe Transylvanian Romanians and Saxons wanted to maintain the separate status of Transylvania in the Habsburg Monarchy, but the Austro-Hungarian Compromise brought about the union of the province with Hungary in 1867. Ethnic Romanian politicians sharply opposed the Hungarian government&#8217;s attempts to transform Hungary into a national state, especially the laws prescribing the obligatory teaching of Hungarian. Leaders of the Romanian National Party proposed the federalization of Austria-Hungary and the Romanian intellectuals established cultural association to promote the use of Romanian.<br \/>\n<strong>World Wars and Greater Romania<br \/>\n<\/strong>Fearing of Russian expansionism, Romania secretly joined the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy in 1883, but public opinion remained hostile to Austria-Hungary. Romania seized Southern Dobruja from Bulgaria in the Second Balkan War in 1913. For German and Austrian-Hungarian diplomacy supported Bulgaria during the war, it brought about a rapprochement between Romania and the Triple Entente of France, Russia and the United Kingdom. The country remained neutral when World War I broke out in 1914, but Prime Minister Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu started negotiations with the Entente Powers. After they promised Austrian-Hungarian territories with a majority of ethnic Romanian population to Romania in the Treaty of Bucharest, Romania entered the war against the Central Powers in 1916. The German and Austrian-Hungarian troops defeated the Romanian army and occupied three-quarters of the country by early 1917. After the October Revolution turned Russia from ally into enemy, Romania was forced to sign a harsh peace treaty with the Central Powers in May 1918, but the collapse of Russia also enabled the union of Bessarabia with Romania. King Ferdinand again mobilized the Romanian army on behalf of the Entente Powers a day before Germany capitulated on 11 November 1918.<br \/>\nAustria-Hungary quickly disintegrated after the war. The General Congress of Bukovina proclaimed the union of the province with Romania on 28 November 1918, and the Grand National Assembly decided the union of Transylvania, Banat, Cri\u0219ana and Maramure\u0219 with the kingdom on 1 December. Peace treaties with Austria, Bulgaria and Hungary delineated the new borders in 1919 and 1920, but the Soviet Union did not acknowledge the loss of Bessarabia. Romania achieved its greatest territorial extent, expanding from the pre-war 137,000\u00a0km2 to 295,000\u00a0km2 (114,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). A new electoral system granted voting rights to all adult male citizens, and a series of radical agrarian reforms transformed the country into a &#8220;nation of small landowners&#8221; between 1918 and 1921. Gender equality as a principle was enacted, but women could not vote or be candidates. Calypso Botez established the National Council of Romanian Women to promote feminist ideas. Romania was a multiethnic country, with ethnic minorities making up about 30% of the population, but the new constitution declared it a unitary national state in 1923. Although minorities could establish their own schools, Romanian language, history and geography could only be taught in Romanian.<br \/>\nAgriculture remained the principal sector of economy, but several branches of industry\u2014especially the production of coal, oil, metals, synthetic rubber, explosives and cosmetics\u2014developed during the interwar period. With oil production of 5.8 million tons in 1930, Romania ranked sixth in the world. Two parties, the National Liberal Party and the National Peasants&#8217; Party, dominated the political life, but the Great Depression brought about significant changes in the 1930s. The democratic parties were squeezed between conflicts with the fascist and Anti-Semitic Iron Guard and the authoritarian tendencies of King Carol II. The King promulgated a new constitution and dissolved the political parties in 1938, replacing the parliamentary system with a royal dictatorship<br \/>\nThe 1938 Munich Agreement convinced King Carol II that France and the United Kingdom could no more defend Romanian interests. German preparations for a new war required the regular supply of Romanian oil and agricultural products. The two countries concluded a treaty about the coordination of their economic policies in 1939, but the King could not persuade Adolf Hitler to guarantee Romania&#8217;s frontiers. Romania was forced to cede Bessarabia and northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union on 26 June 1940, Northern Transylvania to Hungary on 30 August, and Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria in September. After the territorial losses, the King was forced to abdicate in favor of his minor son, Michael I, on 6 September, and Romania was transformed into a national-legionary state under the leadership of General Ion Antonescu. Antonescu signed the Tripartite Pact of Germany, Italy and Japan on 23 November. The Iron Guard staged a coup against Antonescu, but he crushed the riot with German support and introduced a military dictatorship in early 1941.<br \/>\nDue to its role as a significant supplier of oil to the Axis, Romania was a prime target of Allied strategic bombing in 1943 and 1944.<br \/>\nRomania entered World War II soon after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. The country regained Bessarabia and northern Bucovina, and the Germans placed Transnistria (the territory between the rivers Dniester and Dnieper) under Romanian administration. The Romanian and German troops massacred at least 160,000 local Jews in these territories; more than 105,000 Jews and about 11,000 Gypsies died during their deportation from Bessarabia to Transnistria. The vast majority of the Jewish population of Moldavia, Wallachia, Banat and Southern Transylvania survived, but their fundamental rights were limited. After the German occupation of Hungary in March 1944, about 132,000 (mainly Hungarian-speaking) Jews were deported to extermination camps from Northern Transylvania with the Hungarian authorities&#8217; support.<br \/>\nAfter the Soviet victory in the Battle of Stalingrad in 1943, Iuliu Maniu, a leader of the opposition to Antonescu, entered into secret negotiations with British diplomats who made it clear that Romania had to seek reconciliation with the Soviet Union. To facilitate the coordination of their activities against Antonescu&#8217;s regime, the National Liberal and National Peasants&#8217; parties established the National Democratic Bloc which also included the Social Democratic and Communist parties. After a successful Soviet offensive, the young King Michael I ordered the arrest of Antonescu and appointed politicians from the National Democratic Bloc to form a new government on 23 August 1944. Romania switched sides in the war, and nearly 250,000 Romanian troops joined the Red Army&#8217;s military campaign against Hungary and Germany, but Joseph Stalin regarded the country as an occupied territory within the Soviet sphere of influence. Stalin&#8217;s deputy instructed the King to make the Communists&#8217; candidate, Petru Groza, the prime minister in March 1945. The Romanian administration in Northern Transylvania was soon restored, and Groza&#8217;s government carried out an agrarian reform. In February 1947, the Paris Peace Treaties confirmed the return of Northern Transylvania to Romania, but they also legalized the presence of units of the Red Army in the country.<br \/>\n<strong>Communism<br \/>\n<\/strong>During the Soviet occupation of Romania, the Communist-dominated government called for new elections in 1946, which were fraudulently won, with a fabricated 70% majority of the vote. Thus, they rapidly established themselves as the dominant political force. Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, a Communist party leader imprisoned in 1933, escaped in 1944 to become Romania&#8217;s first Communist leader. In 1947 he and others forced King Michael I to abdicate and leave the country, and proclaimed Romania a people&#8217;s republic. Romania remained under the direct military occupation and economic control of the USSR until the late 1950s. During this period, Romania&#8217;s vast natural resources were continuously drained by mixed Soviet-Romanian companies (SovRoms) set up for unilateral exploitative purposes.<br \/>\nIn 1948, the state began to nationalize private firms and to collectivize agriculture. Until the early 1960s, the government severely curtailed political liberties and vigorously suppressed any dissent with the help of the Securitate (the Romanian secret police). During this period the regime launched several campaigns of purges in which numerous &#8220;enemies of the state&#8221; and &#8220;parasite elements&#8221; were targeted for different forms of punishment, such as deportation, internal exile, and internment in forced labour camps and prisons, sometimes for life, as well as extrajudicial killing. Nevertheless, anti-Communist resistance was one of the most long-lasting in the Eastern Bloc. A 2006 Commission estimated the number of direct victims of the Communist repression at two million people.<br \/>\nNicolae Ceau\u0219escu ruled Romania as its Communist leader from 1965 until 1989.\u00a0In 1965, Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu came to power and started to conduct the foreign policy more independently from the Soviet Union. Thus, Communist Romania was the only Warsaw Pact country which refused to participate in the Soviet-led 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia (with Ceau\u0219escu at the time even publicly condemning the action as &#8220;a big mistake, [and] a serious danger to peace in Europe and to the fate of Communism in the world&#8221;); it was also the only Communist state to maintain diplomatic relations with Israel after 1967&#8217;s Six-Day War; and established diplomatic relations with West Germany the same year. At the same time, close ties with the Arab countries (and the PLO) allowed Romania to play a key role in the Israel\u2013Egypt and Israel\u2013PLO peace talks.<br \/>\nThe Romanian Revolution of 1989 was one of the few violent revolutions in the Iron Curtain that brought an end to Communist rule.<br \/>\nAs Romania&#8217;s foreign debt sharply increased between 1977 and 1981 (from US$3 billion to $10\u00a0billion), the influence of international financial organizations (such as the IMF and the World Bank) grew, gradually conflicting with Ceau\u0219escu&#8217;s autocratic rule. The latter eventually initiated a policy of total reimbursement of the foreign debt by imposing austerity steps that impoverished the population and exhausted the economy. The process succeeded in repaying all foreign government debt of Romania in 1989. At the same time, Ceau\u0219escu greatly extended the authority of the Securitate secret police and imposed a severe cult of personality, which led to a dramatic decrease in the dictator&#8217;s popularity and culminated in his overthrow and eventual execution, together with his wife, in the violent Romanian Revolution of December 1989 in which thousands were killed or injured. The charges for which they were executed were, among others, genocide by starvation.<br \/>\n<strong>Contemporary period<br \/>\n<\/strong>After the 1989 revolution, the National Salvation Front (NSF), led by Ion Iliescu, took partial multi-party democratic and free market measures. In April 1990, a sit-in protest contesting the results of that year&#8217;s legislative elections and accusing the NSF, including Iliescu, of being made up of former Communists and members of the Securitate \u2014 rapidly grew to become what was called the Golaniad. The peaceful demonstrations degenerated into violence, prompting the intervention of coal miners summoned by Iliescu. This episode has been documented widely by both local and foreign media, and is remembered as the June 1990 Mineriad.<br \/>\nThe subsequent disintegration of the Front produced several political parties, including most notably the Social Democratic Party and the Democratic Party. The former governed Romania from 1990 until 1996 through several coalitions and governments with Ion Iliescu as head of state. Since then, there have been several other democratic changes of government: in 1996 Emil Constantinescu was elected president, in 2000 Iliescu returned to power, while Traian B\u0103sescu was elected in 2004 and narrowly re-elected in 2009.<br \/>\nIn November 2014, Sibiu (German: Hermannstadt) mayor Klaus Johannis was elected president, unexpectedly defeating former Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who had been in the lead in the opinion polls. This surprise victory is attributed by many to the Romanian diaspora, of which almost 50 percent voted for Iohannis in the first tour, compared to 16 percent for Ponta.<br \/>\nRomania has seen large waves of protests against judicial reforms during the 2017\u20132018 Romanian protests.<br \/>\nThe post-1989 period is also characterized by the fact that most of the former industrial and economic enterprises which were built and operated during the Communist period have been closed, mainly as a result of the policies of privatization of the post-1989 regimes.<br \/>\nCorruption has also been a major issue in contemporary Romanian politics. In November 2015, massive anti-corruption protests which developed in the wake of the Colectiv nightclub fire led to the resignation of Romania&#8217;s Prime Minister Victor Ponta. During 2017\u20132018, in response to measures which were perceived to weaken the fight against corruption, some of the biggest protests since 1989 took place in Romania, with over 500,000 people protesting across the country.<br \/>\nNevertheless, in recent years, many efforts have been made to tackle corruption. A National Anticorruption Directorate was formed in the country in 2002, and according to Transparency International&#8217;s annual Corruption Perceptions Index, Romania is now less corrupt than Italy or Greece (and equals neighbouring Hungary).<br \/>\n<strong>NATO and EU integration<br \/>\n<\/strong>Romania joined the European Union in 2007 and signed the Treaty of Lisbon.<br \/>\nAfter the end of the Cold War, Romania developed closer ties with Western Europe and the United States, eventually joining NATO in 2004, and hosting the 2008 summit in Bucharest.<br \/>\nThe country applied in June 1993 for membership in the European Union and became an Associated State of the EU in 1995, an Acceding Country in 2004, and a full member on 1 January 2007.<br \/>\nDuring the 2000s, Romania enjoyed one of the highest economic growth rates in Europe and has been referred at times as &#8220;the Tiger of Eastern Europe&#8221;. This has been accompanied by a significant improvement in living standards as the country successfully reduced internal poverty and established a functional democratic state. However, Romania&#8217;s development suffered a major setback during the late-2000s recession leading to a large gross domestic product contraction and budget deficit in 2009. This led to Romania borrowing from the International Monetary Fund. The worsening economic conditions led to unrest and triggered a political crisis in 2012.Romania still faces problems related to infrastructure, medical services, education, and corruption. Near the end of 2013, The Economist reported Romania again enjoying &#8216;booming&#8217; economic growth at 4.1% that year, with wages rising fast and a lower unemployment than in Britain. Economic growth accelerated in the midst of government liberalisations in opening up new sectors to competition and investment\u2014most notably, energy and telecoms. In 2016 the Human Development Index ranked Romania as a nation of &#8220;Very High Human Development&#8221;.<br \/>\nFollowing the experience of economic instability throughout the 1990s, and the implementation of a free travel agreement with the EU, a great number of Romanians emigrated to Western Europe and North America, with particularly large communities in Italy and Spain. In 2008, the Romanian diaspora was estimated to be at over two\u00a0million people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GEOGRAPHY AND CLIMATE<br \/>\n<\/strong>With an area of 238,397 square kilometres (92,046\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), Romania is the largest country in Southeastern Europe and the twelfth-largest in Europe. It lies between latitudes 43\u00b0 and 49\u00b0 N and longitudes 20\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 E.<br \/>\nThe terrain is distributed roughly equally between mountains, hills, and plains.<br \/>\nThe Carpathian Mountains dominate the centre of Romania, with 14 mountain ranges reaching above 2,000\u00a0m or 6,600\u00a0ft, the highest of which is Moldoveanu Peak at 2,544\u00a0m or 8,346\u00a0ft.:11 They are surrounded by the Moldavian and Transylvanian plateaus and Carpathian Basin and Wallachian plains.<br \/>\nAbout 47% of the country&#8217;s land area is covered with natural and semi-natural ecosystems. There are almost 10,000\u00a0km2 (3,900\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) (about 5% of the total area) of protected areas in Romania covering 13 national parks and three biosphere reserves.<br \/>\nThe Danube river forms a large part of the border with Serbia and Bulgaria, and flows into the Black Sea, forming the Danube Delta, which is the second-largest and best-preserved delta in Europe, and also a biosphere reserve and a biodiversity World Heritage Site. At 5,800\u00a0km2, the Danube Delta is the largest continuous marshland in Europe, and supports 1,688 different plant species alone.<br \/>\nRomania has one of the largest areas of undisturbed forest in Europe, covering almost 27% of the territory. Some 3,700 plant species have been identified in the country, from which to date 23 have been declared natural monuments, 74 missing, 39 endangered, 171 vulnerable, and 1,253 rare.<br \/>\nThe fauna consists of 33,792 species of animals, 33,085 invertebrate and 707 vertebrate, with almost 400 unique species of mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians, including about 50% of Europe&#8217;s (excluding Russia) brown bears and 20% of its wolves.<br \/>\n<strong>Climate. <\/strong>Owing to its distance from open sea and position on the southeastern portion of the European continent, Romania has a climate that is temperate and continental, with four distinct seasons. The average annual temperature is 11\u00a0\u00b0C in the south and 8\u00a0\u00b0C in the north. In summer, average maximum temperatures in Bucharest rise to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (82\u00a0\u00b0F), and temperatures over 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F) are fairly common in the lower-lying areas of the country. In winter, the average maximum temperature is below 2\u00a0\u00b0C (36\u00a0\u00b0F). Precipitation is average, with over 750\u00a0mm (30\u00a0in) per year only on the highest western mountains, while around Bucharest it drops to approximately 570\u00a0mm. There are some regional differences: in western sections, such as Banat, the climate is milder and has some Mediterranean influences; the eastern part of the country has a more pronounced continental climate. In Dobruja, the Black Sea also exerts an influence over the region&#8217;s climate.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GOVERNANCE<br \/>\n<\/strong>The Constitution of Romania is based on the Constitution of France&#8217;s Fifth Republic and was approved in a national referendum on 8 December 1991, and amended in October 2003 to bring it into conformity with the EU legislation. The country is governed on the basis of a multi-party democratic system and the separation of powers between the legislative, executive and judicial branches. It is a semi-presidential republic where executive functions are held by both government and the president. The latter is elected by popular vote for a maximum of two terms of five years and appoints the prime minister, who in turn appoints the Council of Ministers. The legislative branch of the government, collectively known as the Parliament (residing at the Palace of the Parliament), consists of two chambers (Senate and Chamber of Deputies) whose members are elected every four years by simple plurality.<\/p>\n<p><strong>FOREIGN RELATIONS<br \/>\n<\/strong>Romania is a noteworthy ally of the United States, being the first NATO member state that agreed to support increasing its defence spending after the 2017 Trump-Iohannis meeting at the White House.<br \/>\nSince December 1989, Romania has pursued a policy of strengthening relations with the West in general, more specifically with the United States and the European Union, albeit with limited relations involving the Russian Federation. It joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on 29 March 2004, the European Union (EU) on 1 January 2007, while it had joined the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in 1972, and is a founding member of the World Trade Organization.<br \/>\nPast recent governments states that one of their goals is to strengthen ties with and helping other countries (in particular Moldova, Ukraine, and Georgia) with the process of integration with the rest of the West. Romania has also made clear since the late 1990s that it supports NATO and EU membership for the democratic former Soviet republics in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus. Romania also declared its public support for Turkey, and Croatia joining the European Union. Because it has a large Hungarian minority, Romania has also developed strong relations with Hungary. Romania opted on 1 January 2007, to adhere the Schengen Area, and its bid to join was approved by the European Parliament in June 2011, but was rejected by the EU Council in September 2011.<br \/>\nIn December 2005, President Traian B\u0103sescu and United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice signed an agreement that would allow a U.S. military presence at several Romanian facilities primarily in the eastern part of the country. In May 2009, Hillary Clinton, US Secretary of State, declared that &#8220;Romania is one of the most trustworthy and respectable partners of the USA.&#8221;aRelations with Moldova are a special case, considering that the two countries share the same language and a common history. A movement for unification of Romania and Moldova appeared in the early 1990s after both countries achieved emancipation from communist rule, but lost ground in the mid-1990s when a new Moldovan government pursued an agenda towards preserving a Moldovan republic independent of Romania. After the 2009 protests in Moldova and subsequent removal of Communists from power, relations between the two countries have improved considerably.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MILITARY<br \/>\n<\/strong>Romania is the fourth largest contributor of troops in Afghanistan.\u00a0The Romanian Armed Forces consist of Land, Air, and Naval Forces, and are led by a Commander-in-chief under the supervision of the Ministry of Defense, and by the president as the Supreme Commander during wartime. The Armed Forces consist of approximately 15,000 civilians and 75,000 are military personnel\u201445,800 for land, 13,250 for air, 6,800 for naval forces, and 8,800 in other fields. The total defence spending in 2007 accounted for 2.05% of total national GDP, or approximately US$2.9\u00a0billion, with a total of $11\u00a0billion spent between 2006 and 2011 for modernization and acquisition of new equipment.<br \/>\nThe Air Force currently operates modernized Soviet MiG-21 Lancer fighters that are due to be replaced by twelve F-16s, recently purchased. The Air Force purchased seven new C-27J Spartan tactical airlifters, while the Naval Forces acquired two modernized Type 22 frigates from the British Royal Navy.<br \/>\nRomania has contributed troops to the international coalition in Afghanistan since 2002, with a peak deployment of 1,600 troops in 2010 (which was the 4th largest contributor according to the US). Its combat mission in the country concluded in 2014. Romanian troops participated in the occupation of Iraq, reaching a peak of 730 soldiers before being slowly drawn down to 350 soldiers. Romania terminated its mission in Iraq and withdrew its last troops on 24 July 2009, among the last countries to do so. The Regele Ferdinand frigate participated in the 2011 military intervention in Libya.<br \/>\nIn December 2011, the Romanian Senate unanimously adopted the draft law ratifying the Romania-United States agreement signed in September of the same year that would allow the establishment and operation of a US land-based ballistic missile defence system in Romania as part of NATO&#8217;s efforts to build a continental missile shield.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ECONOMY<br \/>\n<\/strong>Since 2007, Romania has been part of the EU single market.\u00a0In 2019, Romania has a GDP (PPP) of around $547 billion and a GDP per capita (PPP) of $28,189. According to the World Bank, Romania is a high income country with a mixed economy. According to Eurostat, Romania&#8217;s GDP per capita (PPS) was at 63% of the EU average in 2017, an increase from 41% in 2007 (the year of Romania&#8217;s accession to the EU), making Romania one of the fastest growing economies in the EU<br \/>\nAfter 1989 the country experienced a decade of economic instability and decline, led in part by an obsolete industrial base and a lack of structural reform. From 2000 onward, however, the Romanian economy was transformed into one of relative macroeconomic stability, characterized by high growth, low unemployment and declining inflation. In 2006, according to the Romanian Statistics Office, GDP growth in real terms was recorded at 7.7%, one of the highest rates in Europe. However, a recession following the global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009 forced the government to borrow externally, including an IMF \u20ac20bn bailout program. GDP has been growing by over 2% each year since. According to The World Bank, the GDP per capita purchasing power parity grew from $13,442 in 2007 to an estimated $22,124 in 2015. Romania still has one of the lowest net average monthly wages in the EU of \u20ac540 in 2016, and an inflation rate of \u22121.1% in 2016. Unemployment in Romania is at 4.3% in August 2018, which is very low compared to other EU countries.<br \/>\nIndustrial output growth reached 6.5% year-on-year in February 2013, the highest in the EU-27. The largest local companies include car maker Automobile Dacia, Petrom, Rompetrol, Ford Romania, Electrica, Romgaz, RCS &amp; RDS and Banca Transilvania. Exports have increased substantially in the past few years, with a 13% annual rise in exports in 2010. Romania&#8217;s main exports are cars, software, clothing and textiles, industrial machinery, electrical and electronic equipment, metallurgic products, raw materials, military equipment, pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, and agricultural products (fruits, vegetables, and flowers). Trade is mostly centered on the member states of the European Union, with Germany and Italy being the country&#8217;s single largest trading partners. The account balance in 2012 was estimated to be \u22124.52% of the GDP.<br \/>\nIn 2005, the government replaced Romania&#8217;s progressive tax system with a flat tax of 16% for both personal income and corporate profit, among the lowest rates in the European Union. The economy is predominantly based on services, which account for 51% of GDP, even though industry and agriculture also have significant contributions, making up 36% and 13% of GDP, respectively. Additionally, 30% of the Romanian population was employed in 2006 in agriculture and primary production, one of the highest rates in Europe.<br \/>\nSince 2000, Romania has attracted increasing amounts of foreign investment, becoming the single largest investment destination in Southeastern and Central Europe. Foreign direct investment was valued at \u20ac8.3\u00a0billion in 2006. According to a 2011 World Bank report, Romania currently ranks 72nd out of 175 economies in the ease of doing business, scoring lower than other countries in the region such as the Czech Republic. Additionally, a study in 2006 judged it to be the world&#8217;s second-fastest economic reformer (after Georgia).<br \/>\nSince 1867 the official currency has been the Romanian leu (&#8220;lion&#8221;) and following a denomination in 2005, it has been valued at \u20ac0.2\u20130.3. After joining the EU in 2007, Romania is expected to adopt the Euro sometime around 2020.<br \/>\nOn 1 July 2015, Romania&#8217;s external debt was reported to be situated at the sum of \u20ac90.59 billion. In 2018, the external debt of Romania was reported to be situated at the sum of \u20ac96 billion according to the National Bank of Romania.<\/p>\n<p><strong>INFRASTRUCTURE<br \/>\n<\/strong>Bucharest Metro, the only underground railway system, was opened in 1979 and measures 61.41\u00a0km (38.16\u00a0mi) with an average ridership in 2007 of 600,000 passengers during the workweek. There are sixteen international commercial airports in service today. Over 12.8 million passengers flew through Bucharest&#8217;s Henri Coand\u0103 International Airport in 2017.<br \/>\nRomania is a net exporter of electrical energy and is 48th worldwide in terms of consumption of electric energy. Around a third of the produced energy comes from renewable sources, mostly as hydroelectric power. In 2015, the main sources were coal (28%), hydroelectric (30%), nuclear (18%), and hydrocarbons (14%). It has one of the largest refining capacities in Eastern Europe, even though oil and natural gas production has been decreasing for more than a decade. With one of the largest reserves of crude oil and shale gas in Europe, it is among the most energy-independent countries in the European Union, and is looking to further expand its nuclear power plant at Cernavod\u0103.<br \/>\nThere were almost 18.3 million connections to the Internet in June, 2014. According to Bloomberg, in 2013 Romania ranked 5th in the world, and according to The Independent, it ranks number one in Europe at Internet speeds, with Timi\u0219oara ranked among the highest in the world.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TOURISM<br \/>\n<\/strong>Tourism is a significant contributor to the Romanian economy, generating around 5% of GDP. More than 60% of the foreign visitors in 2007 were from other EU countries. The popular summer attractions of Mamaia and other Black Sea Resorts\u00a0attracted 1.3 million tourists in 2009.<br \/>\nMost popular skiing resorts are along the Valea Prahovei and in Poiana Bra\u0219ov. Castles, fortifications, or strongholds as well as well preserved medieval Transylvanian cities or towns such as Cluj-Napoca, Sibiu, Bra\u0219ov, Bistri\u021ba, Media\u0219, Cisn\u0103die, or Sighi\u0219oara also attract a large number of tourists. Bran Castle, near Bra\u0219ov, is one of the most famous attractions in Romania, drawing hundreds of thousands of tourists every year as it is often advertised as being Dracula&#8217;s Castle. Hunedoara Castle is another famous structure.<br \/>\nRural tourism, focusing on folklore and traditions, has become an important alternative, and is targeted to promote such sites as Bran and its Dracula&#8217;s Castle, the painted churches of northern Moldavia, and the wooden churches of Maramure\u0219, or the villages with fortified churches in Transylvania Other attractions include the Danube Delta or the Sculptural Ensemble of Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i at T\u00e2rgu Jiu.<br \/>\nIn 2014, Romania had 32,500 companies which were active in the hotel and restaurant industry, with a total turnover of EUR 2.6 billion. More than 1.9 million foreign tourists visited Romania in 2014, 12% more than in 2013.[323] According to the country&#8217;s National Statistics Institute, some 77% came from Europe (particularly from Germany, Italy, and France), 12% from Asia, and less than 7% from North America.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DEMOGRAPHICS<br \/>\n<\/strong>According to the 2011 census, Romania&#8217;s population is 20,121,641. Like other countries in the region, its population is expected to gradually decline in the coming years as a result of sub-replacement fertility rates and negative net migration rate. In October 2011, Romanians made up 88.9% of the population. The largest ethnic minorities are the Hungarians, 6.1% of the population, and the Roma, 3.0% of the population. Hungarians constitute a majority in the counties of Harghita and Covasna. Other minorities include Ukrainians, Germans, Turks, Lipovans, Aromanians, Tatars, and Serbs. In 1930, there were 745,421 Germans in Romania, but only about 36,000 remain today. As of 2009, there were also approximately 133,000 immigrants living in Romania, primarily from Moldova and China.<br \/>\nThe total fertility rate (TFR) in 2018 was estimated at 1.36 children born per woman, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1, and one of the lowest in the world, it remains considerably below the high of 5.82 children born per woman in 1912. In 2014, 31.2% of births were to unmarried women. The birth rate (9.49\u2030, 2012) is much lower than the mortality rate (11.84\u2030, 2012), resulting in a shrinking (\u22120.26% per year, 2012) and aging population (median age: 41.6 years, 2018), one of the oldest populations in the world, with approximately 16.8% of total population aged 65 years and over. The life expectancy in 2015 was estimated at 74.92 years (71.46 years male, 78.59 years female).<br \/>\nThe number of Romanians and individuals with ancestors born in Romania living abroad is estimated at around 12\u00a0million. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, a significant number of Romanians emigrated to other European countries, North America or Australia. For example, in 1990, 96,919 Romanians permanently settled abroad.<br \/>\n<strong>Languages<\/strong>. Romanian is an Eastern Romance language, part of the larger linguistic family of Romance languages alongside French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Catalan.<br \/>\nThe official language is Romanian, a Romance language (the most widely spoken of the Eastern Romance branch), which presents a consistent degree of similarity to Aromanian, Megleno-Romanian, and Istro-Romanian, but equally shares many features with the rest of the Western Romance languages, specifically Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Catalan. The Romanian alphabet contains the same 26 letters of the standard Latin alphabet, as well as five additional ones (namely &#8216;\u0103&#8217;,&#8217;\u00e2&#8217;,&#8217;\u00ee&#8217;,&#8217;\u021b&#8217;, and &#8216;\u0219&#8217;), totaling 31.<br \/>\nRomanian is spoken as a first language by approximately 90% of the entire population, while Hungarian and Vlax Romani are spoken by 6.2% and 1.2% of the population, respectively. There are also approximately 50,000 native speakers of Ukrainian (concentrated in some compact regions, near the border, where they form local majorities), 25,000 native speakers of German, and 32,000 native speakers of Turkish living in Romania.<br \/>\nAccording to the Constitution, local councils ensure linguistic rights to all minorities, with localities with ethnic minorities of over 20%, that minority&#8217;s language can be used in the public administration, justice system, and education. Foreign citizens and stateless persons that live in Romania have access to justice and education in their own language. English and French are the main foreign languages taught in schools.[349] In 2010, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie identifies 4,756,100 French speakers in the country. According to the 2012 Eurobarometer, English is spoken by 31% of Romanians, French is spoken by 17%, as well as Italian and German, each by 7%.<br \/>\n<strong>Religion.\u00a0<\/strong>Eastern Orthodox 81%, Roman Catholic 4.3%, Reformed 3.8%, Pentecostal 1.8%, Greek Catholic .7%, Baptist .6%, Seventh-day Adventist .4%, Non-Religious .2%, No data 6.1%.<br \/>\nRomania is a secular state and has no state religion. An overwhelming majority of the population identify themselves as Christians. At the country&#8217;s 2011 census, 81.0% of respondents identified as Orthodox Christians belonging to the Romanian Orthodox Church.
