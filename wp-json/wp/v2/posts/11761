Belfort is 400kms from\u00a0Paris, 141kms from\u00a0Strasbourg, 290\u00a0kms from\u00a0Lyon\u00a0and 150kms from\u00a0Z\u00fcrich. The residents of the city are called &#8220;Belfortains&#8221;. The city is located on the\u00a0Savoureuse River, on a strategically important natural route between the\u00a0Rhine\u00a0and the\u00a0Rh\u00f4ne\u00a0\u2013 the\u00a0Belfort Gap\u00a0(Trou\u00e9e de Belfort) or\u00a0Burgundian Gate\u00a0(Porte de Bourgogne). It is located approximately 16kms south from the base of the\u00a0Ballon d&#8217;Alsace\u00a0mountain range, source of the\u00a0Savoureuse. <strong><br \/>\nCitadelle de Belfort.<\/strong> The first fort here was built in the 13<sup>th<\/sup> century. A bastioned front was added in 1648. From 1687-1703, the great French military architect, Vauban added many fortifications to produce what you see today. It resisted a prolonged siege in 1813-14 in the Franco-Prussian War. The perimeter was reinforced in 1842 and in the siege of 1870-71 proved that it could resist shelling. It had no role in either world wars.<br \/>\nIt has magnificent bastioned walls built on the rough stone base, typical of Vauban\u2019s work, surrounding an enclosed 14 hectares plus the Great Underground Passage. The bastions continue down into the town. It was listed as a WHS (Forts of Vauban) in 2005. It can be entered for free.<br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/www.besac.com\/tourisme-franche-comte\/photo\/147.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Citadelle de Belfort.\" width=\"450\" height=\"273\" \/><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-s\/07\/a1\/1b\/29\/citadelle-de-belfort.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Citadelle de Belfort.\" width=\"450\" height=\"338\" \/><br \/>\n<strong>Lion of Belfort.<\/strong> This magnificent sculpture of a lion was produced in from 1872-80 by the architect Auguste Bertholdi to honor the resistance of the 16,000 citizens of Belfort during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 when they defended the city after the French government had already surrendered. It sits on the rock face below the walls of the Citadel of Belfort, in a place that can be seen from anywhere in Belfort. Constructed of blocks of stone, the lion is 11m high and 22m long and tramples a broken arrow under its right front paw. On its front base is the inscription: AVX DEFENSEVRS DE BELFORT 1870-71. There are great views of the city from the terrace with signs showing all the buildings.<br \/>\nIt is a symbol of the city of Belfort, a symbol of stand fastness, strength and valor, a lion harassed and cornered but still terrifying.

This church was designed by Corbusier (1857-1965) and built in 1953-5. The Nortre Dame du Bas church (Lower Our Lady church) is the parish church down in the town of Ronchamp. The upper church is built on a hill used since Greco-Roman times and has been a pilgrimage site since the 11<sup>th<\/sup> century. On Aug 15 of each year, Assumption Day, and again on September 8 (Nativity of the Virgin), it holds a pilgrims festival .<br \/>\nThe exterior is dramatic: an oval tower is on the upper side and presents no windows as you approach it (the windows are on the north side). A huge grey reinforced concrete, curved, overlapping roof tops the church (actually a hollow shell made of two thin membranes held up by 16 steel pillars inserted into the non-load bearing walls). The facade seen on approach is a rising unequal trapezoid with 27 windows, all rectangles and squares, each a different size. That wall is 3m thick constructed of steel covered with a thin layer of concrete sprayed with a cement gun and whitewashed. On the inside there are 3 small triangular chapels in this wall. The windows are multi-paned small squares red, yellow, green and with printed images.<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"http:\/\/img.over-blog.com\/600x397\/2\/89\/06\/71\/ART-MODERNE-2\/le-corbusier-chapelle-de-Ronchamp--2-.JPG\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"450\" height=\"299\" \/><br \/>\nThe front is concave, overlapped by the roof and is an outside choir that can address 2000 pilgrims without a microphone.<br \/>\nThe inside: The tower is an empty cylinder lit by constant north light and has a small concrete altar. There is a concrete altar in the apse, a concrete pulpit and a square window in the front with an 18<sup>th<\/sup> century Virgin and Christ statue that can rotate when the outside choir is used.

The city is located in Eastern France, close to the\u00a0Jura Mountains\u00a0and the border with\u00a0Switzerland. As the capital of the historic and cultural region of\u00a0Franche-Comt\u00e9 it is an important administrative centre. It is also the seat of one of the two\u00a0divisions\u00a0of the\u00a0French Army.<br \/>\nEstablished in a\u00a0meander\u00a0of the\u00a0Doubs river, the city was already important during the Gallo-Roman era under the name of\u00a0Vesontio, capital of the\u00a0Sequani. Its geography and specific history turned it into a military stronghold, a garrison city, a political center, and a religious capital.<br \/>\nBesan\u00e7on is the historical capital of\u00a0watchmaking\u00a0in France. This has led it to become a center for innovative companies in the fields of microtechnology, micromechanics, and biomedical engineering. The\u00a0University of Franche-Comt\u00e9, founded in 1423, every year enrolls more than 20,000 students; its\u00a0Centre for Applied Linguistics\u00a0enrolls another estimated 4,000 trainees from all over the world.<br \/>\nThe greenest city in France,\u00a0it enjoys a quality of life recognized in Europe. Thanks to its rich historical and cultural heritage and its unique architecture, Besan\u00e7on has been labeled a &#8220;Town of Art and History&#8221; since 1986.<br \/>\n<strong>Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts et d&#8217;Arch\u00e9ologie de Besan\u00e7on<\/strong>. This local history museum has all the local archaeology from the Stone Age to Medieval times. The artists are primarily local. \u20ac8<br \/>\n<strong>Citadel of Besan\u00e7on<\/strong>. As one of Vauban\u2019s military architecture masterpieces, it is considered one of the most beautiful in France, it rises over 100m above the old town of Besancon, with great panoramas. The Citadel occupies 11 hectares (27 acres) on Mount Saint-Etienne, one of the seven hills that protect\u00a0Besan\u00e7on, the capital of Franche-Comt\u00e9. Mount Saint-Etienne occupies the neck of an oxbow formed by the river\u00a0Doubs, giving the site a strategic importance that\u00a0Julius Caesar\u00a0recognised as early as 58 BC. The Citadel overlooks the old quarter of the city, which is located within the oxbow, and has views of the city and its surroundings.<br \/>\nBuilt in 1668, the fortification is well preserved. Today it is an important tourist site (over a quarter of a million visitors per year) due both to its own characteristics and because it is the site of several museums. These museums include a museum of the\u00a0Resistance\u00a0and deportation, a museum focusing on traditional life in Franche-Comt\u00e9 and the region&#8217;s archeological history, and a museum of natural history that includes a zoo, an insectarium, an aquarium, vivariums, a noctarium, a climatorium, a pedagogical exhibit on evolution, botanical gardens, and a children&#8217;s farm. There is also a restaurant and shops.<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"http:\/\/en.franche-comte.org\/var\/ezflow_site\/storage\/images\/media\/images\/marques\/urbain-et-grands-sites\/citadelle\/crtfc_0000815\/73691-1-fre-FR\/CRTFC_0000815.jpg\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"450\" height=\"330\" \/><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/arrival.i.lithium.com\/t5\/image\/serverpage\/image-id\/643497i5502D20C1CD91B15?v=1.0\" alt=\"Image result for Citadel of Besan\u00e7on.\" width=\"450\" height=\"338\" \/><br \/>\nOn 7 July 2008,\u00a0UNESCO\u00a0listed the Citadel, together with nearby\u00a0Fort Griffon, as a\u00a0World Heritage Site.<br \/>\nAccess by bus, car (a road exists on both side but neither could be found by Google Maps) or on foot on four marked trails with a map available from the tourist office.

Declared a WHS in 1982 primarily for its architecture, this salt production facility was founded in the reign of Louis XV between 1775-9. It consists of a semi-circle of 11 masterful stone buildings all with great arched facades, built to produce salt using heat to boil off the water. It closed when industrial production of salt occurred in 1895. It was saved from destruction many times. <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"http:\/\/www.assofrance-patrimoinemondial.org\/img\/932x480\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/Salinevueaerienne.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Royal Saltworks of Arc-et-Senan\" width=\"450\" height=\"232\" \/><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5305\/5624402380_3c2a6f4185_b.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Royal Saltworks of Arc-et-Senan\" width=\"450\" height=\"301\" \/><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/www.francethisway.com\/images\/places\/royal-saltworks.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Royal Saltworks of Arc-et-Senan\" width=\"450\" height=\"300\" \/><br \/>\nThere is nothing in the buildings that show any actual salt producing objects but rather a bunch of disconnected exhibits \u2013 it appears that they were hard up to use all the space.<br \/>\nOther than the sign at the door of each building and a plasticized card in most rooms, there is no English so you get a very terse summary of the place.<br \/>\nEnter the magnificent portal full of rough boulders. The first building is the woodworking shops (the salt was sold in barrels made on sight or as blocks) with an exhibit about the architect, Nicolas Ledoux, a true genius who designed many wonderful buildings in France \u2013 most are produced here as very nice white scale models. There is a 31-room hotel that can\u2019t be entered. The worker\u2019s dormitory can\u2019t be entered. Next is a large exhibit on Woodstock (yes the New York music festival in the late 60s \u2013 go figure). The large central building, the manager\u2019s house, has the exhibit on salt production showing many places around the world with open-pan salt and salt mines. The videos are in French and have French subtitles \u2013 go figure!!!!!). The water was boiled off in four iron basins 1m high taking about 24-72 hours. This building was blown up by its owner, the Eastern Salt Company, in 1926 in protest to the building being designated a historical building!!!! (only the French do crazy things like this). The next building has an exhibit on Jules Verne (yes the author, nothing to do with salt). The most interesting place is the forges where tools and the hoops for the barrels were made.<br \/>\nAll in all, this was kind of a waste of time if one were only interested in salt and couldn\u2019t speak French, but the buildings are wonderful. \u20ac10.50<\/p>\n<p><strong>NOMAD MANIA France \u2013 Franche-Comt\u00e9 (Besan\u00e7on, Belfort)<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong><em>World Heritage Sites<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Fortifications of Vauban<br \/>\nFrom the Great Saltworks of Salins-les-Bains to the Royal Saltworks of Arc-et-Senans, the Production of Open-pan Salt<br \/>\nPrehistoric Pile dwellings around the Alps<br \/>\nThe Architectural Work of Le Corbusier, an Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Movement<br \/>\n<strong><em>Tentative WHS<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Sites fun\u00e9raires et m\u00e9moriels de la Premi\u00e8re Guerre mondiale (Front Ouest) (07\/04\/2014)<br \/>\n<strong><em>Borders: <\/em><\/strong>France-Switzerland<br \/>\n<strong><em>XL: <\/em><\/strong>Hotel Arbez Franco-Suisse<br \/>\n<strong><em>House Museums\/Plantations: <\/em><\/strong>Arbois: Maison Louis Pasteur<br \/>\n<strong><em>Castles, Palaces, Forts<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>La Cluse-et-Mijoux: Joux Castle<br \/>\nPontarlier: Fort de Joux<br \/>\n<strong><em>Religious Temples: <\/em><\/strong>Ronchamp: Notre Dame du Haut (Corbusier)<br \/>\n<strong><em>Windmills: <\/em><\/strong>Courvi\u00e8res: Moulin de Courvi\u00e8res<br \/>\n<strong><em>Open-Air Museums: <\/em><\/strong>Nancray: Mus\u00e9e de plein air des maisons comtoises<br \/>\n<strong><em>Bizzarium: <\/em><\/strong>Montbeno\u00eet: Saugeais (micronation)<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>European Cities<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong><strong>BESANCON<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong><em>Railway, Metro, Funiculars, Cable Cars: <\/em><\/strong>Besan\u00e7on Trams<br \/>\n<strong><em>Museums: <\/em><\/strong>Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts et d&#8217;Arch\u00e9ologie de Besan\u00e7on<br \/>\n<strong><em>Castles, Palaces, Forts: <\/em><\/strong>Citadel of Besan\u00e7on<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Villages and Small Towns<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Mouthier-Haute-Pierre<br \/>\nSalains-les-Bains<\/p>\n<p><strong>BELFORT<br \/>\n<em>Castles, Palaces, Forts: <\/em><\/strong>Citadelle de Belfort<br \/>\n<strong><em>Planetariums: <\/em><\/strong>Belfort Planetarium<br \/>\n<strong><em>Monuments: <\/em><\/strong>Belfort: Lion of Belfort<br \/>\n<strong><em>Festivals: <\/em><\/strong>Les Eurock\u00e9ennes, Belfort<\/p>\n<p><strong>SOCHAUX<br \/>\n<em>Museums: <\/em><\/strong>Sochaux: Mus\u00e9e de l&#8217;Aventure Peugeot<br \/>\n<strong><em>Vehicle Museums: <\/em><\/strong>Sochaux: Mus\u00e9e de l&#8217;Aventure Peugeot<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>France \u2013 Franche-Comt\u00e9 (Besan\u00e7on, Belfort) September 13, 2019 BELFORT (pop 50,200) This city in northeastern\u00a0France\u00a0in the\u00a0Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00e9 r\u00e9gion is situated between\u00a0Lyon\u00a0and\u00a0Strasbourg\u00a0and approximately 25kms from the\u00a0French-Swiss border.
