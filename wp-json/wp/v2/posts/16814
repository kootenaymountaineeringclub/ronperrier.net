This can be quite taxing due to the high altitude. There are no campgrounds beyond Hu\u00e1nuco Pampa, so most trekkers place their tents near\u00a0<i>tambos<\/i>\u00a0or on family farms (both typically next to fresh water), paying an informal fee of a few dollars per person to the local community. Basic Spanish is helpful for communication. Temperatures can dip well below freezing at night, but it\u2019s often sunny and spring-like during the day.<\/p>\n<p><b>Booking a tour<\/b>: The Great Inca Trail is generally easy to navigate (look for the stones!), but given the altitude and remoteness, most visitors opt for pack llamas to carry supplies, as well as cooks to source and prepare meals. A full eight-day tour package from Lima with transfers, guides, gear, cooks, llamas, and hotels on either end costs around $5,000 per person.<\/div>\n<div class=\"InsertedAd\" data-bumper-index=\"12\">\n<div class=\"ad-wrapper\" tabindex=\"-1\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n<div data-box-type=\"fitt-adbox-article_dynamic\">\n<div id=\"ad-slot-article_dynamic-423559\" class=\"Ad article_dynamic article_dynamic ad-slot Ad--hasLabel\" data-slot-type=\"article_dynamic\" data-collapse-before-load=\"true\" data-slot-kvps=\"pos=article_dynamic7\" data-label=\"advertisement\" data-google-query-id=\"CKGosNX2i_kCFfICrQYdKtMBhA\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/article>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Explore Inca life beyond Machu Picchu on this South American trail Hiking amid Andean peaks, ancient ruins\u2014and no crowds\u2014on this 19,000-mile stone path from Colombia to Argentina.
