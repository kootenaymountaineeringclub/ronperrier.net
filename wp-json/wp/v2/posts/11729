It has been under the control of many German occupiers since 1031. It is across the river from <strong>Zgorzelec, Poland.\u00a0<\/strong>Near the end of World War II, German troops destroyed all bridges crossing the Lusatian Neisse. The redrawing of boundaries in 1945\u2014in particular the relocation of the German-Polish border to the present Oder-Neisse line\u2014divided the town. The right bank became part of Poland and was renamed <i>Zgorzelec<\/i> by the Polish communist government in 1948, while the main portion on the left bank remained part of Germany, now within the state of Saxony. When the East German states were dissolved in 1952, G\u00f6rlitz became part of the Dresden District, but the states were restored upon German reunification in 1990.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Whilst the town was well preserved, it was notably grey and colourless under communist East German rule. Since reunification, and as of 2013, over 700 buildings have been renovated. It is a popular destination for older people in Germany, offering quiet and relatively affordable accommodations by German standards. Its tourist potential is rapidly expanding. In the case of G\u00f6rlitz, much of the funding for the town&#8217;s building renovations comes from an anonymous donor, who has sent an annual donation of over \u20ac500,000 since 1995, totalling over \u20ac10,000,000.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>Today, G\u00f6rlitz and Zgorzelec, two towns on opposite banks of the narrow river, get along well.

One example of this rich architectural heritage is the Sch\u00f6nhof, which is one of the oldest civic Renaissance buildings in Germany. Another medieval heritage is a model of the Holy Sepulchre, which was constructed in the late 15th century.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Wow, what a gorgeous small city, obviously not impacted by WW II.

The bridge is just below the church.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>St Peter and Paul Church.<\/strong> Built as a 3-nave church in 1230, the neo-Romanesque fa\u00e7ade was incorporated into the Gothic reconstruction in the 15th century, when two more side naves were added, making it a 5-nave church and almost square in plan. The lone stained glass window is the only survivor of the Allied bombing of the bridge below the church in 1945. The Sun Organ has the organ pipes arranged as sunbeams around small sun faces \u2013 it was reconstructed in 1995-97 with 6,095 pipes. The original two church bells, weighing over 10,850 kg, were melted down during World War I. In 1891, the concrete spires were added.

It is in each of the architectural encyclopedias and mentioned within the same breath as the Villa Tugendhat\u00a0by Mies van der Rohe\u00a0in Bruenn\/Brno, Czech Republic (1931), The Villa Savoye by Le Corbusier in Poissy, near Paris, France (1928 &#8211; 1929) and the House Kaufmann, Fallingwater by Frank Lloyd Wright, Mill Run, Pennsylvania, USA (1935 &#8211; 1939).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In 1930, Hans Scharoun designed the house for Fritz Schminke, the owner of a noodles factory in Loebau, Saxony, Germany, who wished for &#8220;&#8230;a modern home for two parents, four children, and one or two occasional guests&#8230;&#8221;. The realization was both fanciful and functionally adequate. A curved main body, terraces, outside stairs and numerous round, porthole-shaped windows inspire the connotation of a steamship. Rooms merge seamlessly; generous grasslands extend the garden as an integral part of the living space. Besides span and lucency, manifold design elements contribute to the overall spatial experience. Developed especially for the house, their colours and shapes set outstanding courses. In contrast, utility rooms, including a Frankfurt kitchen, and the sleeping area remain sparse by design, featuring easy-to-clean surfaces and space-saving built-in closets.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In 1945, the Russian Red Army confiscated the house, and it became a Soviet Army military commander&#8217;s office. The Schminkes regained the house in 1946, but at the same time, Fritz was expropriated from his Anker pasta factory. Then, his wife Charlotte established a children&#8217;s recreation home for the families of bomb victims to make a living. Her husband returned from Russian war captivity in 1948 and left the former GDR in 1950. He was regarded as a war criminal for being a supplier to the German Army Wehrmacht during World War II His wife followed him, and both of them lived in Celle, Lower Saxony, in 1951. In 1963, it became the &#8220;Haus der Pioniere&#8221; (&#8220;House for the Pioneers&#8221;), the former official communist organization for children until German reunification. The city of Loebau established a leisure center for teenagers in 1990. It was in 1993 when the Schminke family renounced their house&#8217;s back transfer for the benefit of public use.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"http:\/\/derarchitektbda.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/Haus-Schminke-von-Nord-Ost-Foto-Juliane-Richter.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Villa Schminke\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Cathedral of St Peter<\/strong>, Bautzen. The first church was built in the 10th century, and a cathedral was constructed in the 13th century. Between 1456 and 1463, the cathedral that now stands was built and named after St. Peter. A fourth nave was added to the original structure. After a fire in 1634, the interior is seen today. The church is a mixture of several different architectural styles, the most prominent being Gothic and Baroque. The Baroque dome was added to the tower in 1664.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup> Since 1530, both Catholics and Lutherans have shared the building.

It occupies 92 km\u00b2 in the 93 km region between Pirna and the Czech border. The tributaries of the Elbe River have cut narrow gorges through the table mountains, creating strangely eroded rock formations, sandstone cliffs, and other unique geological features. The park features 700 rock climbs, 400 km of hiking trails, and 400 km of cycle routes, along with numerous vantage points offering panoramic views.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Most people view the park as part of a day trip from Dresden, often arriving by boat via the Elbe. Or you can base yourself in Pirna, Obervogelgesand or Bad Schandau. There is no official entry point, and it can be accessed on all paths.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Kirnitzschtal tramway<\/strong>, Bad Schandau. This is the S\u00e4chsische Schweiz National Park&#8217;s two-car electric tram, which runs 7.1 kilometres from the resort town of Bad Schandau to the last stop at Lichtenhainer Wasserfall. The track is on the south side of the road, following the small Kirnitzsch stream. It is flat and located in the forest, with limited views. There are seven stops, each giving access to trails, and with pubs and inns at most stops. \u20ac4<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Konigstein Fortress<\/strong>, Konigstein. Above the town of K\u00f6nigstein on a table hill on the left bank of the River Elbe, it is one of the most extensive hilltop fortifications in Europe. The 9.5-hectare rock plateau rises 240 metres above the Elbe and has over 50 buildings, some over 400 years old, that bear witness to the military and civilian life in the fortress. The rampart run of the fortress is 1,800 metres long, with walls up to 42 metres high and steep sandstone faces.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A stone castle likely existed on K\u00f6nigstein as early as the 12th century. The oldest surviving structure today is the castle chapel built at the turn of the 13th century. In the years 1563 to 1569, the 152.5 metre deep well was bored into the rock within the castle, the deepest in Saxony and the second deepest well in Europe.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The fortress played an essential role in the History of Saxony as its actual military significance was rather marginal. The Saxon Dukes and Prince-Electors used the fortress primarily as a secure refuge during times of war, as a hunting lodge and maison de plaisance, but also as a dreaded state prison.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The fortress was tasked with guarding the Saxon state reserves and secret archives during times of war. In 1756 and 1813, Dresden&#8217;s art treasures were also stored at K\u00f6nigstein. During the Second World War, the large casemates of the fortress were also used for such purposes. The fortress was never conquered. Only the chimney sweep, Sebastian Abratzky, managed to climb the vertical sandstone walls in 1848. The Abratzky Chimney is a Grade IV climbing route that remains climbable to this day. Because climbing over the wall is banned, climbers must abseil down the adjacent wall again after climbing it. The fortress, which has been used as a state prison for centuries, remains intact and is now one of Saxony&#8217;s most prominent tourist attractions, attracting around 700,000 visitors annually.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">This is a very imposing fortress sitting high above the village of K\u00f6nigstein. From the north, the main access is marked by a massive stone wall that extends up from the contours of an immense rock face. Take a toy train or bus from the parking area up to the bottom of the wall and the fortress.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The inside has several buildings and castles. The most imposing is George\u2019s Castle with a great bastion, striking defences, and the Commander\u2019s House. There are several exhibits in the Commander\u2019s House Stable, Treasury House, Gate House, Magdalene\u2019s Castle, Well House, and Garrison Church. Woods have taken over the south end of the fortress, and this part of the fortress is only visitable by guided tour.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A wooden crane on the outside of the wall, operated by a pedal wheel, was installed in 1592 to take goods 42m to the top of the fortress. In 1852, power was generated by a steam engine, and by 1911, it was generated by electricity. However, all of this was removed in 1992. A Panorama Lift was installed in 2005 but remained non-operational. Access to the fortress is via a goods lift located at the base of the wall. \u20ac12, no reduction<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/farm1.staticflickr.com\/782\/22442464385_c2be572a8c_c.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for konigstein fortress\" width=\"450\" height=\"347\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>BASTEIBR\u00dcCKE <\/strong>(Bastei Bridge), Rathen. Part of the national park, this is an odd place to find. The 2km long entrance road to Rathen has no sign for Bastei, just many hotels and almost no parking. The only parking is well above the town. Most people arrive here by boat from Dresden. The city fronts the Elbe River.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In the village, arrive at a pedestrianized zone and park (I slept here overnight and found a place at a hotel, but during the day, it would be impossible). The signs at the bottom are also somewhat confusing, as they are in German, and none mention \u201cBastei,\u201d instead leading up a cobbled road to the south.

It starts in Rathen (about a 15 km drive from Bad Schandau) as the access trail to the bridge, crosses the bridge and heads south \u2013 Steinerner Tisch 20 minutes, Stadt Wehlen 1\u00bc hours, Hollengrind and Lohmen 1\u00be hours.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Felsenburg Neurathen.<\/strong> Pass the castle just before you reach the bridge. In a completely impossible location, it was built in 1289 by Bohemian nobility to protect their borders. In 1466, bandits controlled it, in 1467, it was besieged by Saxony and burned down in 1469. All that remains is the courtyard, cistern, and traces of rooms with placements cut for the wooden beams and bridges that connected all the pinnacles. However, it is well worth exploring for its location and 120m of parapet crossing several pinnacles, which offer fantastic views of the bridge, down into the canyon, and to all the surrounding mountains and pinnacles. A small compass sign names every bump and mountain in the near and far vicinity. The two most prominent are Napoleonsschanze (1813m) and Lilienstein across the river. \u20ac2<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Bastei Bridge.<\/strong> This is a stone\/concrete pedestrian bridge built in 1850-51 with five arches and six piers fixed to pinnacles. It was an enjoyable 30-minute walk from Rathen. A trail to the best viewpoint takes off from the Maleweg. The place was packed with photographers.

After losing inhabitants due to the First World War, Chemnitz experienced rapid growth and reached its all-time peak of 360,250 inhabitants in 1930. Allied bombing destroyed 41 per cent of the built-up area of Chemnitz during the Second World War. <sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>Chemnitz contained factories that produced military hardware and a Flossenb\u00fcrg forced labour subcamp (500 female inmates).
