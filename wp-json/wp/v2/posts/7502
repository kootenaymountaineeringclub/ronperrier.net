Quite a shame really, as it is one of the more interesting peaks of this cluster of four &#8211; Boomerang, Robert Smith, Nansen and Giegerich \u2013 lying west of Enterprise Pass. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">On July 4, Doug Brown and I drove to about 1800 metres via logging roads in Timber Creek and parked at km 7.3, where a bridge had been pulled. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">We followed the old logging road north crossing two creeks along the way. After about 0.5 km, the road divides, one fork carries on to the north, while the other switchbacks south. We took the north fork for about another 100 metres before turning uphill (NE) and hiking up through the cutblock to the woods above. In the woods, the bushwhacking was pretty reasonable and we reached the alpine basin below Boomerang Mountain in about 1\u00bd hours. Here we got out our binoculars to pick out a route to the summit. On the lower part of the south face, a prominent crack\/chimney runs about a third of the way up the face from climbers left to right. Above the crack, a gully travels pretty much directly up to the summit. This looked like a good route so we hiked up to the base, put on our helmets and started scrambling. The crack\/chimney is the crux of the route and is an unexposed 4th class. Once out of the crack, we got into an easy class 2 gully which we followed up, curving slightly to climbers left at the top and popped out pretty much right at the summit cairn. 2\u00bd hours with stops at the summit. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">We returned the same way, the chimney\/crack being considerably more entertaining to climb down than up and were back at the truck less than 2 hours after leaving the summit. Although we didn&#8217;t use one, some people might find a rope handy on this route. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Driving directions: Take Enterprise Creek Road for 11.9 km.
