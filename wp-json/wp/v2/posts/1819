It starts with a gut-busting climb up into the most mountainous highlands of the island before rambling by alpine lakes and grasslands, then diving down into the rain forest. It is recommended as a six-day trip and includes side trips such as a scramble up Tasmania\u2019s highest peak, 5,305-foot Mount Ossa A hut system on the trail means you don\u2019t need a tent. Many hikers also tack on the worthwhile hike around Lake St. Clair, Australia\u2019s deepest lake, to end the hike instead of riding a ferry across to the finish. Tasmania is home to a menagerie of famed wildlife, including the wombat, platypus, and Tasmanian devil.<br \/>\n<em>When to Go:<\/em> Tasmania Parks and Wildlife requires hikers to book reservations and travel north to south during the prime season of October 1 and May 31.<br \/>\n2. <strong>Bay of Fires<\/strong>, Tasmania<br \/>\n<em>Length:<\/em> 16 miles, 4 days.\u2028 Stumpy\u2019s Bay to Bay of Fires Lodge\u2028<br \/>\n<em>The Trip:<\/em> Go with the Bay of Fires Walk; it\u2019s the only way in or out.\u2028From the start in Mount William National Park to the finish at the impressive Bay of Fires Lodge, the route never deviates from seemingly endless beaches of blinding white sand and surreal rock formations lapped by a turquoise Tasman Sea. Only the occasional headland of granite boulders, turned blood red by lichen or forested points of shoreline, pushes you up and out of the coves. The Bay of Fires walk is a four-day guided trip; you can\u2019t do it solo, as there is no water on the route so no place to overnight. The first day takes you out to a permanent camp at Forester Beach. The second, longer day finishes at the architecturally striking Bay of Fires Lodge. Day three is the ultimate reward: free time on the stunning Bay of Fires coast with the comforts and fine wine of the lodge at your beck and call.<br \/>\n<em>When to Go:<\/em> October to May is the season for this beach route along the northeastern shore.<br \/>\n3. <strong>Great Ocean Walk<\/strong><br \/>\nLength: 91 km on coast of Victoria.<br \/>\n<em>The Trip:<\/em> Starts in Apollo Bay 9 (2 1\/2 hour drive SW of Melbourne) to near Glenample Homestead.

It was first opened in 1979, but did not reach its present complete state until 1998 The Bibbulum is named for the indigenous people of the area (the Bibbulum or Noongar people who still live here), and it winds into the land of the original inhabitants and the wonderland of Australia\u2019s endemic flora and fauna. It\u2019s common to find snakes, ranging from the death adder to the tiger snake. Along the track, there are also rare creatures like the numbat, a termite-eating marsupial that looks like a cross between weasel and opossum, and the chuditch, a quoll or carnivorous marsupial, that is threatened by nonnative, and very poisonous cane toads. Along the Donnelly River, 250-foot-tall karri eucalyptus shelter purple-crowned lorikeets squawking far above in the canopy.\u2028Besides all that wildlife, though, it\u2019s the social aspect of the trail that makes it most Australian.\u2028At the campsites you will meet hikers from around the globe as well as regular Australians.<br \/>\nIt\u2019s easy to access most segments of the Bibbulmun Track for day trips or shorter overnight jaunts. The Bibbulmun Track Foundation even offers Day Walk Map Packs to make it easy to do so. One of the best spots for day walks is in the giant karri forests of the Donnelly River.<br \/>\n<em>\u2028\u2028When to Go:<\/em> The austral spring (September to November) and fall (March to May) are the best times, with hikers starting in spring heading north-south to avoid the heat and those in fall making the trip from south-north to outrun the winter.\u2028\u2028<br \/>\n5.
