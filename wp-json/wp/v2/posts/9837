July 16-22<\/p>\n<p><strong>History.<\/strong> Around 1200, a fishing community known as Aemstelredamme (the dam across the Amstel River), emerged and grew into a centre for sea trade. Unfettered by high taxes and medieval feudal structures, a society of individualism and capitalism took root. The modern idea of Amsterdam \u2013 free, open, progressive \u2013 was born.<br \/>\nThe city flourished during the 17th-century\u00a0Golden Age. Merchants and artisans flocked in, Rembrandt painted and city planners built the canals. By the next century though, international wars and trade competition stagnated the local economy.<br \/>\nIn 1806 Napoleon\u2019s brother Louis became king of Holland and eventually moved into the city hall on the Dam and transformed it into the Royal Palace. Infrastructure projects such as the Central Station, the Rijksmuseum, and harbour expansion followed later in the 19<sup>th<\/sup> century.<br \/>\nWWI and the Great Depression took their toll in the form of food shortages and increasing poverty. WWII brought hardship, hunger, and devastation to the local Jewish community during the Nazi occupation. Only one in every 16 of Amsterdam\u2019s Jews survived the war.<br \/>\nDuring the 1960s, Amsterdam became Europe\u2019s \u2018Magic Centre\u2019: hippies smoked dope on the Dam and camped in Vondelpark. In 1972, the first <i>coffee shop<\/i>\u00a0opened, and in 1976 marijuana was decriminalized to free up police resources for combating hard drugs.<br \/>\nBy the 1990s the city\u2019s economy had shifted to white-collar jobs and thriving service industry, while gentrification increased. The ethnic makeup changed too, with non-Ditch nationalities (particularly Moroccans, Surinamese, and Turks) comprising more than 45% of the population.<br \/>\nTwo high-profile murders and protests over immigration marked the first years of the 21<sup>st<\/sup> century. A new metro line, massive suburban islands, and other grand urban projects were associated with 200 start-up companies within a 6.5km radius of the centre.<\/p>\n<p><em>While my van was being repaired in south Amsterdam, I stayed at a hostel \u2013 Via Amsterdam. With 744 beds in 8 stories, it must be close to the biggest hostel in the world. I had to make a booking relatively late for such a popular city and this was one of the few on Hostelworld that had a good rating of 8.5 and had beds. It was about 7kms SE of the city centre and about .8km from Diemen-zuid metro station. For this distance, it was relatively expensive at about <\/em><em>\u20ac34\/night. I was in an 8-bed mixed dorm and was looking forward to staying in a hostel for once. I miss the ability to meet other travellers, but this was a pretty young crowd.<br \/>\n<\/em><em>I went into the city on the morning of the 18<sup>th<\/sup> with plans for a big museum and sightseeing day. <\/em><\/p>\n<p>Amsterdam is compact and easy to roam on foot. The major sites are clustered in the city centre or within a few kilometres, such as the Old South\u2019s famous art museums 3km from Centraal Station.<br \/>\n<em><u>Day 1<br \/>\n<\/u><\/em><strong>EASTERN ISLANDS &amp; PLANTAGE<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>NEMO<\/strong> (Museum of Science). The dramatic, green copper building rises from the water like a ship setting sail. This is a great place for kids with many hands-on exhibits. NEMO\u2019s stepped, deck-like roof is the city\u2019s largest summer terrace with panoramic views.<br \/>\n<strong>Het Scheepvaartmuseum<\/strong> (Maritime Museum). An immense, 17th-century\u00a0admiralty building houses one of the world\u2019s most extensive collections of maritime memorabilia: the Dutch East India Company (VOE), 400 model ships, whaling, and the Port of Amsterdam are all detailed. Moored outside is the replica of the Dutch East India Company\u2019s 1748, 700-ton Amsterdam, one of the largest ships of the fleet. 357 sailors were on board.<br \/>\n<strong>Versetsmuseum<\/strong> (Dutch Resistance Museum). This museum shows how much courage it takes to actively resist an adversary so ruthless that you can\u2019t trust your neighbours, friends, or family. It gives insight into the political and social situation in the Netherlands before the war \u2013 the four groups were the Catholics, Protestants, Socialists, and liberals &#8211; and the difficulties faced by those who fought the German occupation from within. There is a large exhibit on the Jewish situation.<br \/>\n<strong>Portuguese Jewish Synagogue.<\/strong> When the Jews were expelled from Spain in 1485 and from Portugal in 1492, Jews spread all over Europe and many came to the Netherlands because of its religious tolerance. This was the largest synagogue in Europe when it was completed in 1675, and it is still in use today by the Sephardic Jewish community. The interior features massive pillars and some two-dozen brass chandeliers. The large library belonging to the Ets Haim seminary is one of the oldest and most important Jewish book collections in Europe. The Treasury has 16th-century\u00a0manuscripts and gold-threaded tapestries.<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amsterdamtips.com\/tips\/portuguese-synagogue.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwik9bPgrbDcAhXBY1AKHcsYAFsQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"http:\/\/www.amsterdamtips.com\/photos\/portuguese-synagogue-amsterdam.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Portuguese Jewish Synagogue.\" width=\"550\" height=\"354\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Joods Historical Museum<\/strong> (National Historical Museum). This is a beautifully restored complex of four Ashkenazic synagogues (the Ashkenazi were Jews from eastern and central Europe who spoke Yiddish). The Great Synagogue was built in 1671 and the others over the next century. Displays show the rise of Jewish enterprise and its role in the Dutch economy and the history of Jews in the Netherlands. Of 140,000 Jews in the Netherlands before WWII, there were only 30,000 after. Today there are 45, 000 in the country, half of whom live in Amsterdam and the majority of the rest in the Randstad area. 57% don\u2019t practice any religion, 17% celebrate feast days, and the remaining 25% form the three Jewish communities.<br \/>\n<strong>Hermitage Amsterdam.<\/strong> The long-standing ties of Russia and the Netherlands \u2013 Tsar Peter the Great learned shipbuilding here in 1697 \u2013 led to this local branch of St Petersburg\u2019s Hermitage Museum. Wonderful temporary exhibitions change about twice per year. I saw the Outsiders Exhibit featuring all Finnish artists.<br \/>\n<strong>Museum het Rembrandthuis.<\/strong> Rembrandt paid 13.000 guilders to build this house in 1639 and lived there until 1658 when he went bankrupt, the house was sold and he moved into a rental.

Prostitution was legalized in the Netherlands in 1810 and in brothels in 2000. Since 2008, the city says organized crime has entered the scene. Each window costs \u20ac75-150 per 8-hour shift and they pay taxes generating \u20ac650 million annually.<br \/>\nThe area is busy in the evenings with many restaurants, bars, shops, and sex shows. Zeedijk, Warmoesstraat and Oudezijds are the main streets.<\/p>\n<p>None of these three museums are public and not on the Museum Kaart.<br \/>\n<strong>Sex Museum Amsterdam.<\/strong> There are replicas of pornographic Pompeian plates, erotic 14th-century\u00a0Viennese bronzes, some of the world\u2019s earliest nude photographs, dildos and a Kama Sutra encyclopedic collection of positions.<br \/>\n<strong>Red Light Secrets Museum of Prostitution.<\/strong> This fills a gap by showing visitors what a Red Light room looks like and answering basic questions about the industry.

Highlights include an extensive pipe collection, vaporizers, hemp art, and historical items.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Oude Kerk.<\/strong> This is the oldest building in Amsterdam and the youngest art museum. It was transformed from a Catholic church (1306-1578) to a Protestant in 1578 It has no function as a church and is bare inside but still has nice wood choir stalls.<br \/>\nTwice a year, artists are commissioned to reflect on their heritage. The present is very unusual \u2013 the artist Giorgio Cal\u00f2 from Venice has masked all the windows in red. There is no artificial light or absolutely anything else in the building \u2013 it is eerily quiet and alienating. The absence of images references the Great Iconoclasm of 1566 and relates to the destruction of images.<br \/>\n<strong>Royal Palace.<\/strong> Opened as a town hall in 1655, this building became a palace in the 19<sup>th<\/sup> century under Louis Bonaparte (Napoleon\u2019s brother, king from 1806-1813).

In 1566, all the Catholic churches in Amsterdam were brutally stripped of statues and paintings by the Protestants as pomp and ceremony did not fit in with their beliefs of not distracting from the word of God and worship of false saints. The Catholic city council and monks were forced to leave the city. The walls were painted white indicating purity, cleanliness, and forgiveness of sin; only black and grey remained.<br \/>\nThe church appears to not function in any religious capacity and the World Press Awards 2018 was on show. I had already seen this in Den Haag but this was much better curated.<br \/>\n<strong>Begijnhof.<\/strong> This building complex was formed by pious, single women who did not want to live in a convent but still perform good deeds. The enclosed neighbourhood was originally built in 1389 (fires destroyed most of it in 1421 and 1425) and from 1578-1795 they were a tolerated Catholic group not allowed to openly practice religion but left in peace as the buildings were their own personal property \u2013 an RC enclave in Protestant Holland for 200 years. The church was consecrated in 1418 and given to the Protestants in 1607. They practiced Catholicism in hidden churches in their houses until 1671 when they built the small chapel, the Kapel. The last occupant died in 1971. In 1980, the houses were in a bad state, a large renovation occurred in 1987 and it is still occupied by 108 single women with the complex operated by the Begijnhof Foundation.<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amsterdam-nu.nl\/monumenten\/110-begijnhof-in-amsterdam.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwjW5KCVs7DcAhVREVAKHV0oAlwQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/www.stedenman.nl\/attachments\/Amsterdam_begijnhof-4.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for begijnhof amsterdam amsterdam\" width=\"550\" height=\"237\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/nl.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Engelse_Hervormde_Kerk_(Amsterdam)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwi_u4a8s7DcAhUDEVAKHS2qC2QQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/1\/14\/Overzicht_westgevel_en_zuidgevel_-_Amsterdam_-_20534348_-_RCE.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for begijnhof amsterdam amsterdam\" width=\"325\" height=\"386\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em><u>Day 2<br \/>\n<\/u><\/em><strong>SOUTHERN CANAL RING<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Stedelijk Museum<\/strong> (National Museum of Modern Art).

As the museum doesn\u2019t open till 9:30, this would be a good time to try to book. Otherwise, it is luck and a lot of work to get one of the 20% of the tickets available on short notice. I tried at midnight as I didn\u2019t know the above routine that would have increased my chances.<br \/>\nThis draws over 1 million visitors annually to see the reconstruction of Anne\u2019s melancholy bedroom and her actual diary, filled with sunnily optimistic writing tempered with quiet despair, is a powerful experience.<br \/>\n<strong>Westerkerk.<\/strong> The main gathering place for Amsterdam\u2019s Dutch Reformed community, this church was built for rich Protestants to a 1620 design. The nave is the largest in the Netherlands and is covered by a wooden barrel vault, but the rest of the church\u2019s d\u00e9cor is unadorned wood wainscoting. The huge main organ dates from 1686 with panels decorated with instruments and biblical scenes. Climb the tower on a guided tour offered every 30 minutes for \u20ac8. Rembrandt was buried in a pauper\u2019s grave somewhere in the church. It is next door to the Anne Frank House.<\/p>\n<p><em><u>Day 3<br \/>\n<\/u><\/em>I saw all the museums that I had missed. It made for a lot of walking as they were spread throughout Amsterdam: Tropenmuseum, De Duif Church, Amsterdam Pipe Museum, De Krijtberg Church, Westerkerk, Begijnhof, Hash, Marijuana &amp; Hemp Museum, Red Light Secrets Museum of Prostitution, Sex Museum, and Bicycle Flat. Please refer to the specific area for the description.<\/p>\n<p><em>I had been informed that my camper van would be ready on Friday, July 20. The original estimate was <\/em><em>\u20ac3,900 and I made a <\/em><em>\u20ac3500 bank transfer as A-Point, the VW dealer that was doing the repairs would not accept non-Netherlands credit cards, so it was necessary to use a bank transfer. However, I was informed on the 19<sup>th<\/sup> the estimate was low and I would need to pay an additional <\/em><em>\u20ac2700. I made that transfer that evening but it requires 2 days to occur. As a result, the dealership would not release the van as the money was not physically in their account.<br \/>\n<\/em><em>I attempted to withdraw\u00a0<\/em><em>\u20ac2700 but it was impossible as my credit cards were blocked. So I returned to Via Amsterdam to spend another 3 nights. I needed a rest from my frenetic pace over the last 5 months anyway. It would give me a chance to get caught up on all the things that need to be done: my website, reading, sleeping. The costs of withdrawing money on the credit card (bad exchange rates, immediate 21% interest charges, withdrawal fees) would have also been prohibitive.<br \/>\n<\/em><em>On arrival, I got the last room in this 744-bed behemoth. It was karaoke night so I had to listen to mad singing until 1 am.

I purchased a second VW California from MyCalifornia.eu, a company I can heartily recommend \u2013 a great price (over \u20ac11,000 cheaper than my first California and with more options) and superb service. They picked me up at the Amsterdam airport, we went to their office in Naarden, filled out all the paperwork and I drove off on my adventure.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>As it was the middle of winter, I was keen to get to southern Europe but decided to see the rest of the Netherlands I had missed (west and north), western Germany, Luxemburg, SE Belgium, and west-central France on my way to Spain and Portugal.

It is the tallest wooden mill in the Netherlands at 26.6 meters high and is registered as a National Monument. The Gooyer consists of a stone foundation topped by a wooden octagonal body. The mill is owned by the municipality of Amsterdam and is not open to visitors. Although the blades are functional, they no longer operate any grinding mechanism.<br \/>\nNext to the mill, in the former municipal bathhouse dating back to 1911, is the\u00a0Brouwerij &#8216;t IJ. The mill and the bathhouse building are unrelated, and the mill fulfills no function for the brewery despite the image of a mill being in the brewery logo.<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.brouwerijhetij.nl\/molen-de-gooyer\/?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwjego6J1vDfAhVRzaQKHe7AAD8QjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"http:\/\/www.brouwerijhetij.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/De-Gooyer-Molen.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for de gooyer\" width=\"353\" height=\"353\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Crane Hotel<\/strong>\u00a0<strong>Faralda<\/strong>\u00a0is a\u00a0hotel\u00a0located at the top of a\u00a0monumental\u00a0crane\u00a0on the\u00a0NDSM site, a former shipyard on the banks of\u00a0the IJ\u00a0in\u00a0Amsterdam North.<br \/>\nThe crane was built in the 1950s but by 1984, was no longer used.
