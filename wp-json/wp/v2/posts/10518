During the 1968 Six Day War Israel captured territories over the Green Line including the West Bank and east Jerusalem. The international community deems these areas \u2018Occupied Territories\u2019, whereas Israel calls them \u2018Disputed Territories\u2019. Between the end of the 1984 Arab-Israeli War and the Six Day War in 1967, the West Bank and East Jerusalem were under Jordanian rule as set out in the 1949 Armistice agreement.<br \/>\nDuring Israel\u2019s creation in 1948 and the 1967 Six Day War more than half of Palestinians living in pre-1948 Palestine were displacd, one of the largest displaced populations in the world. There has been dispute over what actually happened in 1948. Palestinians accuse the Israelis of widespread ethnic cleansing whereas the Israelis claim the Arab population left of its own accord to avoid a war started by its Arab neighbours. Palestinians refer to the creation of Israel as the catastrophe and the right of return for these refugees has proven to be a major stumbling block to peace.<br \/>\nSince 1967 successive Israeli governments have encouraged Israeli citizens to live in settlements in the Occupied West Bank by offering land and financial incentives. The international community regards the settlements as contrary to international law. There are over 200 Israeli settlements in the West Bank, housing over 300,000 Israelis, not including East Jerusalem, and along with the roads and buffer zones around them, they take up at least 40% of the West Bank land. The settlers are subject to Israeli law and Palestinians are not allowed to enter settlements without permission.<br \/>\nAbout a fifth of the West Bank, mostly in the Jordan Valley, is designated a \u2018closed military area\u2019. Once you add this to the settlements and the Israeli declared \u2018nature reserves\u2019, it turn out that 90% of the West Bank\u2019s fertile, water rich Jordan Valley is off limits to Palestinians.<br \/>\nThe Oslo Accords in the early 90s divided the West Bank into three temporary administrative zones. Meant to be an interim measure while final status negotiations took place between the two sides, and a deal reached on the transfer of power from the Israeli Civil Authority to the Palestinian Authority. It never happened.<br \/>\nApproximately 61% of the West Bank, including the 90% of the Jordan Valley, falls within Area C (total Israeli control). Israeli government figures show that between January 2000 and September 2007, over 94% of building permit applications in Area C submitted by Palestinian were refused.; 1,600 Palestinian buildings were demolished and a further 5,000 demolition orders issued.<br \/>\nIn 2012, there were 350 children in Israeli prisons often in \u2018prolonged periods of solitary confinement, in inhumane and degrading conditions\u2019. Their familes are often unable to get the permits for access into Israel to visit them. Israel treats its won population as minors until 18, whereas Palestinian children are charged as adults from 16. Most offences are for stone throwing, which carries a maximum 20-year sentence. Nearly all convictions are as a result of a \u2018confession. Over 300kms of roads in the West Bank are off-limits or restricted to Palestinians.<br \/>\nThe UN and the International Court of Justice argue that as Israel is the \u201cOccupying Power\u2019, the settlers are Israel\u2019s \u2018civilian population\u2019 and the \u2018territory it occupies\u2019 is the West Bank, therefore they deem Israeli settlements to be illegal under international law, a view held by the entire international community except Israel.<br \/>\nThere are four legal points that Israel develops against this global view.<br \/>\nIsrael argues that the West Bank cannot be \u2018occupied\u2019 as they say it wasn\u2019t anybody\u2019s to begin with. It is, therefore, \u2018disputed territroy\u2019 and hence not covered by the Fourth Geneva Convention. Ergo their behavior is legal.<br \/>\nIsrael goes on to argue that even if that isn\u2019t the case, the treaty means forcible transfers of the civilian population and as nobody forced the settlers to mve to the Wes Bank, Israel isn\u2019t in contravention.<br \/>\nEven if that isn\u2019t the case, the treaty was only created because of WWII, and was only meant to deal with simiar circumstances. So, unless there is again a global conflict involving a small man with a mustache, then the Convention doesn\u2019t apply.<br \/>\nAnd finally, evne if that inturn isn\u2019t the case, they advance the legal invocation of \u2018bollacks to you\u2019.<br \/>\nThe Israeli settlers are a significant part of the problem. There are 121 illegal settlemets on the Wes tBank housing some 300,000 settlers (one in nine people). When it\u2019s finished, the Barrier will encircle 69 illegal settlements binging 83% of the settlers on the West Bank into Israel \u2013 a process that is causing enormous hardship for Palestinians.<br \/>\nSettlers are portrayed as religious zealots defying the rule of the law, not dissimilar to American \u2018surivalists\u2019.<br \/>\nIsraelis constantly say that this is one point of view and that you need to talk to everyone to understand the situation. Settlers and soldiers are at one end of the spectrum. The other end are political activists. In the middle is all the rest of Israel. These people aren\u2019t near the wall, they don\u2019t live there and it barely intrudes on their consciousness. 70% of Israelis live on the coast in places like Tel Aviv, with their croissants and small dogs. And they want a nice life. They don\u2019t want to live next to the Occupation and the Wall. If they knew what it was like for the Palestinians, they would not allow it. But most Israelis don\u2019t want to know. They don\u2019t know and if they do, they don\u2019t care. The crazies do not represent all Israelis.<br \/>\nBut this is not good enough. It is no good saying \u201cwe are not like them,\u201d if no one takes responsibility for them. The settlers are de facto government policy: they build and expand into the West Bank unless stopped. All the Israelis have failed to stop the settlers and control them. And until they do, Israel will allow the settlers to create facts on the ground.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BETHLEHEM<\/strong> (pop 28,000)<br \/>\nThe preconceived image of a small stone village with a manger and shepherds in their fields is actually a normal modern Israeli town. Christians now make up 19% of the town, down from 85% in 1948. The shops have all but closed (the town couldn\u2019t be visited between 2000 and 2008) and most travellers come on a short day trip to see the two significant sites. The centre of town is Manger Square, basically a large parking lot.<br \/>\nI went here with a tour (expensive at 190S). A taxi took us to the famous checkpoint. Expecting heavy security, we didn\u2019t even have to show our passports. On the other side, we were met by our Christian Palestinian guide (neither are allowed to cross the Wall). He gave a great tour with lots of information. When we left, we met the taxi at the wall again and simply drove through &#8211; totally underwhelming and disappointing &#8211; I wanted to experience the heavy security (I would get a chance a week later at Jenin).<br \/>\n<strong>Church of the Nativity.<\/strong> Commissioned in AD 326 by Emperor Constantine, this is the world\u2019s oldest continuously functioning church (in contrast to Jerusalem\u2019s churches destroyed by the Persians, this one was spared as the mosaic had 3 wise men dressed in Persian clothes). Two of the original 3 doors have been closed by subsequent construction and the middle door has been reduced 3 times with all the previous entrances easily visible in the stone work. Part of the original 326 mosaic floor is exposed. The inside was in the process of a total restoration with scaffolding everywhere but the significant places were available &#8211; the underground Grotto of the Nativity, where Jesus is said to have been born, and the Manger, an actual cave. The spot is marked by a 14-sided star with a worn stone in the centre. A parade of tourists streams by to kneel at the sacred spot. The day we were there had virtually no wait &#8211; usually the line is hundreds of meters out the door. The Grotto is actually under a Russian Orthodox church donated by Russia with classic icons and elaborate wood carving. The exit of the grotto is into an Armenian Orthodox church that is adjoined by the Roman Catholic St Catherine\u2019s Church, from which Bethlehem\u2019s famous Catholic Midnight Mass is broadcast on Christmas Eve.<br \/>\n<strong>Milk Grotto Chapel.<\/strong> Mary and Joseph stopped here to feed the baby during their flight to Europe. Two depictions actually show Mary breast feeding. Touching the chalk wall reputably brings about miracles.<br \/>\n<strong>Banksy Graffiti.<\/strong> This British graffiti artist is world famous. Nobody knows his face or name for sure. And he has done a lot in Palestine. We saw one of his most famous on the side of a building: a man throwing a bouquet of flowers. His technique looks stenciled and apparently, he produces much of the art from elaborate stencils prepared beforehand to save time on the final product. A huge amount of his art has been destroyed as all of it makes controversial statements. And the stuff that is for sale sells for very high prices.<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"http:\/\/undergroundparis.org\/banksys-bethlehem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwj_8OrW8NHfAhUIIDQIHQBLDpwQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"http:\/\/undergroundparis.org\/files\/2015\/06\/banksy-bethlehem-IMG_3217.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for banksy graffiti bethlehem\" width=\"529\" height=\"353\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<a class=\"rg_l\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.ca\/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fc1.staticflickr.com%2F6%2F5302%2F5598348217_53db1ca14d_b.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flickr.com%2Fphotos%2Faarsbog%2F5598348217&amp;docid=e6RtZp-SGnWSJM&amp;tbnid=3646E8lfDhwj_M%3A&amp;vet=10ahUKEwi-266j8NHfAhUHGTQIHXZ7BXoQMwhPKBIwEg..i&amp;w=1024&amp;h=768&amp;bih=616&amp;biw=1330&amp;q=banksy%20graffiti%20bethlehem&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-266j8NHfAhUHGTQIHXZ7BXoQMwhPKBIwEg&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"rg_ic rg_i\" src=\"https:\/\/encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR5MR4GJ0RmrisoH5Uumd_fCpNQqnz4uipAIjoJXqLr2A2_hz572g\" alt=\"Image result for banksy graffiti bethlehem\" data-src=\"https:\/\/encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR5MR4GJ0RmrisoH5Uumd_fCpNQqnz4uipAIjoJXqLr2A2_hz572g\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<span class=\"item spaced text-30794 \"><strong>Badd Giacaman Museum<\/strong><\/span>\u00a0(al-Bad Museum for Olive Oil Production) Located in the center of\u00a0Bethlehem, near the\u00a0Church of the Nativity, it\u00a0houses several ethnographic and archaeological artifacts depicting the process of\u00a0olive oil\u00a0production. The exhibits demonstrate the use of olive oil for lamps, medicine, food, soap, cosmetics, etc.<br \/>\n<strong><span class=\"item spaced text-30796 \">Baituna al Talhami Museum<\/span><\/strong>\u00a0(Bethlehem Folklore Museum). One of the largest museums in the\u00a0Palestinian territories, it is located in on\u00a0Star Street, slightly off Pope Paul VI Street. It was originally set up in 1948 as a centre for\u00a0Palestinian refugees\u00a0fleeing their villages to eat, and practice in\u00a0traditional embroidery\u00a0for income.<br \/>\nNow it consists of two typical Palestinian houses &#8211; the first with a renovated kitchen, a\u00a0<i>diwan<\/i>\u00a0room, a bedroom and an upper floor or\u00a0<i>illeyeh (<\/i>with a forty-year collection of photographs, furniture, and works of art is in the upper room showing the life of Bethlehem residents between 1900 and 1932) and a\u00a0museum of traditional Palestinian household items displayed in an old house. It is one of the few authentic old houses left in Bethlehem\u2026 similar to the house in which Jesus was born.<br \/>\nAlthough Baituna al-Talhami is run as a museum, it still serves and employs refugees, as well as host festivals celebrating Palestinian artists, poets and writers.<sup id=\"cite_ref-B_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup><\/p>\n<p><strong>NORTH PALESTINE<\/strong><br \/>\nAs NOTHING is open, you must prepare for Shabbat by 2pm Friday. I went to the large market with 2 young Germans and have never experienced anything like it in the world &#8211; packed, vibrant, everybody shopping, eating, drinking beer, a mass of people. The selection of fresh vegetables, bread and pastry was superb at great prices. The many restaurants were full.<br \/>\nThe big occasion on Friday dusk is to go to the Western Wall for the beginning of Shabbat. In 1600, a group of Jews decided to celebrate the start of Shabbat with singing psalms and dancing. This has grown and most celebrated here. At sundown, a group of soldiers entered the area, danced in circle and sang whipped into a minor frenzy by one older man. Soon other groups started &#8211; each was dressed a little differently and are apparently slightly different sects. There was a lot of prayer with the largest concentration at the far north end of the wall, closest to the holiest sites. Many of the ultra-orthodox men wore a huge cake-shaped fur hat. On the other side of the fence, the women also sang and danced but all in one big group.<br \/>\nIn 1948, Ben Gurion wanted the ultra-orthodox to participate in the political process and made two concessions: that they would not have to serve in the military and the ultra-orthodox would have control over religious sites. Since the Western Wall has been segregated into men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s sections.<br \/>\nI then went to the Shabbat meal at the Abraham Hostel down the street from Jerusalem Hostel. This meal celebrates the beginning of Shabbat. Jerusalem Hostel also had a Shabbat meal but I had no desire to eat it there. I was asked by the guys who prepared it if I was going to attend their Shabbat meal. I immediately said no and then (in my usual outspoken manner) volunteered why &#8220;Because you are not friendly&#8221;. I had hoped that the people at Abraham Hostel would be &#8220;friendlier, but they weren&#8217;t either. They were pleasant and nice, but not friendly. I spent Shabbat relaxing and reading &#8211; there was nothing else to do.<\/p>\n<p><strong>VISITING THE WEST BANK<\/strong> from Nazareth<br \/>\nGoing to the West Bank is rewarding, safe and easy. Distances are short and crossing the border checkpoint into the Palestinian Territory is easy. Exiting is not so easy. Palestinians are happy to see foreigners and eager to talk to them. Prices are much lower than in Israel. There are two completely different sets of rules and regulations for Jewish Israelis and Arabs (even if you are an American Arab).<br \/>\nThe Oslo Accords of the early 1990s divided the West Bank into three zones: Areas A, B and C. Area A is under the control of the Palestinian Authority and includes the major cities of Ramallah (the capital), Jenin and Nablus. Area B, mostly smaller mid-sized towns is jointly under the control of Palestinians and Israelis. Area C, the rural communities, is under full control of Israel. In the mid 1990s, there were hundreds of military checkpoints but now there are only a few.<br \/>\nBig red signs warn Israelis to not go here because as they view it dangerous (and it might be for them). The sign reads \u201cTHIS ROAD LEADS TO AREA \u2018A\u2019 UNDER THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY. THE ENTRANCE FOR ISRAELI CITIZENS IS FORBIDDEN, DANGEROUS TO YOUR LIVES AND IS AGAINST THE ISRAELI LAW\u201d. The intent may be to simply keep Palestinians and Jews apart. But Palestinians have little hostility to foreigners and indeed are much friendlier than Israelis. However, the lack of English can get in the way of really talking to people in order to get a sense of what their life is like. Often the brief conversations end with \u2018welcome&#8217;.<br \/>\n<strong>Transportation:<\/strong> There are several ways to get around.<br \/>\n<em>Rental Car.<\/em> This may be the most efficient way to see the most towns and things but are comparatively expensive and give you no feel for Palestinians. You also have to find your own way, easier with GPS and a good map. Rent from the local companies, not an Israeli national company who usually forbid crossing into Palestine.<br \/>\n<em>Sheruts.<\/em> These shared taxis are ubiquitous and the main way locals travel. Inexpensive (15-30S per trip depending on distance traveled), they leave when full and stop frequently to pick up and let off passengers. You are also traveling with the locals. Get off at the sherut stands so that you know where to catch the next one. Often the stands going to each individual town are separate. Simply ask around and the locals will happily give directions.<br \/>\n<strong>Border Checkpoints.<\/strong> <em>Getting in<\/em> was surprisingly easy. The sherut first stopped at the walk through gate and the two Palestinians got out and the van with Israelis drove around to the car entry. Everyone held up their passport or identity card and that was it. Then we picked up the Palestinians.<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/woodblockdreams.blogspot.com\/2010\/11\/first-land.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwiu_7LK9tHfAhVlz1QKHb5nApcQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"http:\/\/farm5.static.flickr.com\/4128\/5190067415_d243eb1120.jpg\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"459\" height=\"353\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/DCYtSHc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwi05I2C99HfAhWKsFQKHREOAoIQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/t7PERaX.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for palestine border wall\" width=\"471\" height=\"353\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"http:\/\/showerofkunst.com\/sok\/2016\/01\/04\/on-the-sidelines-of-graffiti-on-the-apartheid-wall\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwj-rJey99HfAhWjh1QKHf7oBcEQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"http:\/\/showerofkunst.com\/sok\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Screen-Shot-2016-01-04-at-17.28.45.jpg\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"626\" height=\"353\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<em>Getting out<\/em> was considerably more difficult. The sherut stopped at the border and dropped me off. It was 2:30pm and I was told the gate would not be open until 3 but it still wasn\u2019t at 3:20. I tried to hitchhike the whole time but didn\u2019t have an offer until 5:20 despite there being many cars with yellow license plates (Israeli are the only ones who can cross; Palestinian license plates are white for personal vehicles and green for taxis and sheruts). A few cars were going slowly enough for me to say that I was Canadian, but they all said it was too dangerous to give me a ride. In fact it was simple to cross in a car. They only asked why I visited Jenin.<\/p>\n<p><strong>JENIN<\/strong> \u2013 From Old City Nazareth, catch the 8am sherut that goes to Jenin across the street from the main bus stop on the main street. Arrive at 7:30 to ensure a seat. The yellow van holds 10 people and costs 25S. Despite slow traffic before Afula, and a few detours to pick up passengers, it was only 45 minutes to Jenin. Crossing the border was easy. The two Palestinians were dropped off at the walk-through entrance. The rest of us drove through and only had to hold up our passports\/identity cards. Then we picked up the Palestinians when across the border.<br \/>\nAsk to be dropped off at the large sherut stand in the centre of town so that you know where to go to catch the next one to Nablus. Saturday is a good day to visit as it is market day. There is no main market per se but the whole centre of town is a market. Carts piled with strawberries and nuts are in the middle of the streets. Tables stacked with goods cover the sidewalks and encroach out into the road. The large vegetable market is NE of the sherut stand. The quantity and quality of vegetables was impressive. I simply walked around, asked questions and got a feeling for the town. The streets were very busy with a slight sense of chaos. Roads were narrow, garbage is a little more common, pavement more broken. There are no tourist sights here. By 9:30, I was off to Nablus.<\/p>\n<p><strong>NABLUS.<\/strong> Traveling SE, the sherut climbed high up over the rocky hills. Villages dot the hillsides and valleys. Olives seem to be the main crop and everything is terraced. We passed one short section of the barrier wall that dipped incongruously to the edge of the road. There was a large quarry for the yellow limestone characteristic of the area and several businesses were processing the stone.<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"http:\/\/thisongoingwar.blogspot.com\/2018\/06\/18-jun-18-large-hamas-align-terror.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwjSoMjq89HfAhXEFTQIHUxtCO0QjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-XlJmlnXabCg\/WydT30e_dtI\/AAAAAAAE7ug\/cILlWISK8uwgp2RcRT_qLAXsE4RM0z7cwCLcBGAs\/s1600\/2018_06_18%2BNablus%2B-%2Bvia%2BGreen%2BOlive%2BTours%2B.jpg\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"629\" height=\"353\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nA fellow on the sherut took me to the stand for Sebastiya.

We can\u2019t enter Israel. But none of us will leave, this is our home. We will always live here, no matter how hard it is. We hate the governments of Canada, the US and Britain but not the people. Your governments support Israel but not Palestine. We call ourselves resistance, we are not terrorists. Look at all the mountaintops around Nablus \u2013 every hill has an illegal Israeli settlement or outpost. Israeli soldiers raid our houses in the middle of the night and terrorize the teenagers who often spend the night in jail.&#8221;<br \/>\nI visited the 800-year-old soap factory (on one corner of the main square) and the market (much larger than Nazareth\u2019s), but not the kanafi factory or Jacob\u2019s Well. I had two falafel sandwiches for 3S each (20S each in Israel). In the main square was a peaceful demonstration of teachers protesting the Palestinian government and their low wages (3000S or US$750 per month). They&#8217;ve been on strike for the last 4 weeks. There I talked to 2 English teachers. One has children attending university in Istanbul and Palestine, but he could send them no money.

The Romans were here from 63BC to 324AD when the city was part of the province of Syria. Emperor Octavian (who was renamed Augustus in 27BC) gave it to King Herod in 30BC to govern in the name of Rome and Herod renamed it Sebastos (or Augustus meaning \u2018great\u2019 or \u2018revered\u2019). The Romans constructed the city wall, a collonaded street with 600 columns, the basilica, forum, theatre, temples of Augustus and Kore, the stadium and aqueduct. The Byzantines (324-636AD) built 2 churches dedicated to John the Baptist, the Muslims a mosque and the Crusaders a cathedral.<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"http:\/\/alray.ps\/en\/index.php?act=post&amp;id=751\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwjo2KiB9tHfAhUKHnwKHe8fC_EQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"http:\/\/alray.ps\/en\/uploads\/images\/7593d7436104c744a58d1451fbd741a1.jpg\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"660\" height=\"243\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nI took a shurut back to Nablus, found the shurut stand to Jenin (about 2 blocks north) and had a great ride with 6 young guys. Two spoke good English and we had lots of laughs. We passed through one military checkpoint. The young black Israeli soldier was extremely rude with a big scowl on his face. The stand for the shurut to the border is a couple of blocks north east. A young guy walked me there. I have already described my experience crossing back into Israel. The first hitch hike drove me to the highway intersection going to Afula and Nazareth and it took two more rides to get to a bus stop for Nazareth. Then I got bus 354 but it didn&#8217;t go to the Old City so needed a city bus for the final leg.<br \/>\nIt was a wonderful day. The best experience was simply seeing the towns and countryside and talking to a few Palestinians with good English. I have huge sympathy for the Palestinians.
