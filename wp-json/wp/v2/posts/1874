Malawi, the smallest of the three, is bigger than Massachusetts. Up to 700m deep. Forms 75% of Malawi&#8217;s eastern border with Mozambique and Tanzania. 850 different species of cichlids, all evolved from a single ancestor stranded eons ago (more species than any other fresh-water lake in the world). Most are mbuna, a colourful fish that lives in rocky areas and is aggressive and territorial. When to go: May-Oct &#8211; dry season; Oct-Nov best for wildlife viewing but hot; Nov-April wet season very warm and humid, millions of swarming lake flies. Cape McClear &#8211; sand and granite hills on slender finger of land at southern end of lake; legendary backpacker hangout with sun, snorkelling, chill in village, stay in reed huts on beach; one of most famous freshwater dive sites in world.

The largest non-Arctic desert and the size of the United States, it stretches more than 9 million sq. km across most of North Africa. Very harsh climate with surface temperatures to 50C in June to August. Annual rainfall less than 20mm in parts. In winter in Jan-March, may be well below freezing at night. Seasonal winds with sand storms and dust devils. It&#8217;s desert landforms shaped by wind and rain are ergs (sand seas), hamadas (stone plateaus), regs (gravel plains), wadis (dry valleys) and choltts (salt flats).<br \/>\nClassic oasis towns are Merzouga in Morocco, Tamanasset in Algeria, Ghadamis in Libya, Douz in Tunisia and Siwa in Egypt. Oasis are fed by underground system of flowing rivers sustained by snow on mountains in the Sahara. See the flaming orange dunes of Erg Chebbi in Morocco, chalky mineral deposits of the White Desert in Egypt, Roman ruins of Leptis Magna slong the Mediterranean coast in Libya, Ahaggar Mtns in Algeria and date palmeries in Tunisia. Luxor (Thebes) in Egypt, the Great Sand Sea straddles Egypt and Libya, 800km long, 72,000 sq km, some of the largest dunes in the world including one 140kms long.

Abu&#8217;s Camp &#8211; Okavango Delta is world&#8217;s largest inland delta. Transportation by elephant gives access to otherwise impossible places. Elephant smell masks the human smell allowing close access to wildlife.<br \/>\n<strong>Natural:<\/strong> 1. Tsodilo Hills, Ngamiland<br \/>\n2. Okavango Delta, Ngamiland &#8211; The rainy season in Angola pumps huge volumes of water down the tributaries that feed the mighty Okavango River. 16,000 sq. km inland delta where the Okavango River meets the Kalahari Desert to produce the world&#8217;s largest oasis the size of Switzerland. Floodplains, lagoons, channels and islands have birds, elephants, zebras, buffalos, giraffes and hippos. Chacma baboons can live for over 45 years. Sitatunga is an amphibious antelope with long, splayed hooves adapted to the muddy terrain. Moremi Wildlife Reserve on eastern fringe very scenic. Moremi has African hunting dogs, among the rarest of carnivores with 30% of Africa&#8217;s total population. No bad time to visit: summer rains (late Dec-Mar) make roads a problem. Floods from rain in Angola come in the winter, which coincides with the dry season (Jul-Oct). Wildlife watching best Sept-Oct when hot and humid. Low-season still good and much cheaper.<br \/>\n3. Chobe River &#8211; Western Strip, Zambia  Chobe NP in corner of Botswana, Zambia, Namibia and Zimbabwe. Varied wildlife best known for Africa&#8217;s highest concentration of elephants numbering in the tens of thousands. River in north of park has vast herds of buffalo, zebra impala, wildebeest, antelope, cheetahs, wild dogs hyenas, elephant and lions. Best during the dry season (May-Oct) when seasonal water disappears and wildlife concentrates around a few scattered waterholes. Savuti is a section of the park with a unique hydrology with limited access to water in the dry season. This drives lion prides to take on potentially dangerous animals such as lone adult elephants. Lions on the hunt are a common sight. The Choba Riverfront is the most famous part of the NP as see animals as they come down to the river&#8217;s edge to drink and you see them from a boat. See from a mokoro, a traditional dug-out canoe with The Okavango Polers Trust, a collective run by the villagers of Seronga. All profits are shared by the workers.<br \/>\n4. Choba, Makgadikgadi Pans, Central District. Access from Kasane in NE Botswana. Chobe is one of the best places to see interactions between the super-predators: lions (unchallenged at the top of the pecking order), hyenas (danger to young lions, drive small prides of lions off their kill, dominate other hunters and follow lions on the hunt), leopards and cheetahs (at the very bottom of the hierarchy, cheetahs have sacrificed brute force for speed and can&#8217;t physically overpower the others so invariably give way to them, regardless of numbers. Visit with very expensive lodges or camps in the Inner Delta or Moremi Game Reserve or as an independent traveller arranging mokoro trips from Maun or Seronga to see the eastern delta by 4WD or camps run by the Department of Wildlife &#038; National Parks.<br \/>\n5. Savuti Channel &#8211; links the Savuti Marshes with the Okavango Delta to create an oasis for herds and birds. Stops and starts with little rhyme or reason: its flow is independent of the Chobe River. At times the channel has even stopped flowing for years at a stretch (from 1888-1957, 1966-1967 and 1979 to mid 1990s). Some believe this is due to plate tectonics that control an imperceptible, gradual flexing of the surface crust. The minimum change required to open or close the channel is estimated to be at least 9m and there&#8217;s evidence that this has happened at least five times over the past century. Access from Maun (on SE) or Seronga on the norhtwest. See by mokoro and walking on islands and dry patches, horse or by air to grasp the scale of the flooding<br \/>\n6. Kalahari &#8211; see brown hyenas in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve<br \/>\n7. San People of D&#8217;kar in the harsh environment of Botswana&#8217;s interior.

Safaris depart Windhoek. The protected area stretches from just north of Swakaopmundd to the Kunene River, 2m hectares of dunes and gravel plains to form one of the world&#8217;s most inhospitable waterless areas. 4. Namib Desert* &#8211; World&#8217;s oldest and driest with 1,000&#8242;-high sand dunes especially good at dusk and dawn. Best Apr-Nov. Like the Atacama, it is the result of a cold current sweeping north from Antarctica and capturing and condensing humid air that would otherwise be blown ashore so there is virtually no rain but hardy life sustains itself on the droplets of moisture that condense from the coastal fog. See the rare subspecies of desert elephant. Food and water is so dispersed that they walk up to 80km per day following dry river channels. With smaller bodies and larger feet for maintaining balance in the loose sands, they are well adapted. Seasonal rains fall from January to April provide essential nutrition. Sightings increase after rains when herds are reliant on water holes. Sossusvtel* is a pan set among towering red dunes. Best seen with guide from Skeleton Coast Damp or the Desert Rhino Camp.

Fish River Canyon<br \/>\nLength: 90km<br \/>\nLocated in the south of Namibia, it is the largest canyon in Africa with a gigantic ravine \u2013 about 160 km long, up to 27 km wide and 550 meters deep. The canyon is known for its immense scale, rugged terrain and deeply twisting, meandering lower canyon. The river cuts deep into a dry, stony plateau and flows intermittently, usually flooding in late summer; the rest of the year it becomes a chain of long narrow pools.<br \/>\nThe 90km long trail drops 620m to end at the hot springs resort of Ai-Aisthe. Most people do it in five days but the 100km ultra marathon held here each year has been done in 8 hours. The trail is only open from May 1 to September 15 because of extreme summer heat and flood danger. The more than 20 river crossings may become a major consideration when water levels are high.<br \/>\nThe weather is usually mild with typical temperatures between 5\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C with little humidity. Water is safe to drink. There are no amenities on the trail. Open fires are not allowed. A medical certificate of fitness is required. <\/p>\n<p><strong>NIGER<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Unesco:<\/strong> 1. Air and Tenere Natural Reserves  2.

As the water temperature drops, migratory fish depart, leaving only the year-around marine life and concentrating shark-feeding activity on fewer areas and making them easier to spot. Endangered due to overfishing and accidental catching in fishing nets. See great whites eat fur seals. Also see dolphins, whales and birds (albatross, petrel and shearwaters). Cage diving is the biggest thrill &#8211; use a snorkel or simply hold your breath for repeated dips. Best place is Seal Islandm just off Cape Town or Dyer Island, a rock outcrop just offshore from Gansbaai, a little farther east. The sharks are baited with a pungent mix of fish blood, oil and guts that attracts the animals but doesn&#8217;t provide a meal. If fed from boats, great whites make the connection between man and food, leading to more attacks on humans. Of 100+ annual shark attacks worldwide, half are due to great whites. Most are not fatal with the shark taking just a sample bite. More than 100 million sharks are killed annually by humans, fewer than 25 humans are killed each year by sharks. The max size is about 6m long with the females larger.<br \/>\n49. Boulders Beach, Cape Town &#8211; 3000 African penguins live on this beach near Simon&#8217;s Town<br \/>\n50.

Marion Island, South Indian Ocean &#8211; A tiny speck midway between S Africa and Antarctica. 215,000 breeding adult king penguins, elephant seals, fur seals, albatross and passing whales. When? Weather is consistently bad with cold, rain, wind and perpetual cloud. Summer Dec-Feb highs average 9C. King penguins lay from November to March, incubating a single egg on their feet for nearly two months and the adults then rear the chicks for about a year. Share beach with elephant seals and fur seals that prey on the penguins. Feral cats on the island almost completely wiped out the petrels but an extermination campaign eliminated all cats in the 90s. King penguins are the second largest penguin after Emperors, 80cm tall. Serially monogamous for that breeding cycle. Island claimed by South Africa in 1947. Unfortunately the public is not allowed on Marion but can see king penguins at: St Andrews Bay, South Georgia, Volunteer Beach Falklands (wiped out in the 19th century, now 500 pairs), Tierra del Fuego and Macquarie Island Antarctica, permits required.<br \/>\n<strong>1,000 Things:<\/strong> 1.

Many travelers here book guides. The Drakensberg is the highest mountain range in South Africa, a vertiginous escarpment of volcanic basalt bursting from ancient sedimentary rocks. The range forms the border between South Africa and eastern Lesotho and the uKhalhlamba\/Drakensberg Park is protected by UNESCO as a World Heritage site. The Zulus call these peaks uKhahlamba, \u201cbarrier of spears.\u201d It is crowned by the Amphitheater, a three-mile-long, up-to-3,280-foot-high wall of rock.<br \/>\nA trek across this epic landscape begins by ascending the 12-mile Mont-aux-Sources, which requires clambering on chain ladders, and a worthy day trip. Here the Tugela River plunges 3,110 feet off the top in a series of five cascades that make for the second highest waterfall in the world. From here, the trek crosses the high plateau\u2014broken by rock formations, views out across the cliffs, and the huts of Sotho herdsman\u2014before it works its way down past more waterfalls and river crossings before meeting up with the welcome civilization of the Cathedral Peak Hotel. Cathedral Peak can be hiked and scrambled on a six-mile jaunt from the Cathedral Peak Hotel. The most popular campsites can be targets for petty crime, so tent off the beaten path or stay at a hut or hostel. It&#8217;s not a good idea to hike alone.<br \/>\nThe Drakensberg is filled with caves. Some, like the aptly named Rat Hole Cave, are claustrophobic. Others are massive, like the infamous Cannibal Cave, which sheltered San who were persecuted by Zulus and white settlers. They left behind an artistic legacy of cave paintings and makes the Drakensberg one of the most important archaeological sites on the continent.<br \/>\n<em>When to Go:<\/em> Late summer and fall (March to May)\u2028<br \/>\n2.

(Kilimanjaro and Kenya are taller, but they aren\u2019t ranges.) You\u2019ll hike three days through two 14,000-foot passes and mind-bending forests of giant groundsel and giant lobelias to get to the Bujuku Hut, base camp for those wanting to climb Mount Speke. Hike one more day to Elena Hut, base camp for those who want to climb the glaciers, and try for the summit of Mount Stanley for its unique views of the Congo Basin. Two more trail days take you over Scott Elliot Pass, the highest on the circuit at 14,344 feet, and back to the starting point for your eventual return to Kampala.<br \/>\nBring a pair of indestructible camp shoes impervious to moisture, such as Crocs.
