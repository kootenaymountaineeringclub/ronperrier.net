There were no issues at either border, specifically my vehicle insurance was active in Romania.<br \/>\nI decided to see the<\/em> <em>north west and north of Romania first. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Drobeta-Turnu-Severin. <\/strong>A NM \u201cEuropean City\u201d, its significant history dates to Roman times when it was called Drobeta. The Trajan Bridge was the largest in the Roman Empire as the Danube here is 1,200m wide.\u00a0Built in only three years (103\u2013105 AD) by the famous architect Apollodorus of Damascus, the bridge was considered the most daring work in the Roman world. The bridge was built on 20 pillars of stone blocks, was 1135 m long, 14.55 m wide and 18.60 m high. Each bridge head had its own portal monument, whose remains can still be seen on both sides of the Danube. Oaks from 200 hectares of forest were used for the wooden parts of the construction. The bridge was composed of twenty arches supported by stone pillars. Only two of them are still visible at low water.\u00a0Drobeta became, from a strategic perspective, a town at the crossing of land and water roads which led to the north and south of the Danube.<br \/>\nDuring the reign of Emperor Hadrian (117\u2013138 AD), the settlement was declared a city in 121 AD and had a population of 14,000. During the reign of Septimius Severus (193\u2013211 AD), the city was raised to the rank of a colony (193 AD), which gave its residents equal rights with citizens of Rome. As a colony, Drobeta was a thriving city with temples, a basilica, a theater, a forum, a port and guilds of craftsmen. In the middle of the 3rd century, Drobeta covered an area of 60 hectares and had a population of almost 40,000 inhabitants.\u00a0After the retreat of the Roman administration from Dacia in the 4th century, the city was preserved under Roman occupation as a bridge head on the north bank of the Danube until the 6th century. Destroyed by Huns in the 5th century, it was rebuilt by Justinian I (527-565).<br \/>\nThe fortress of Severin was built by the Kingdom of Hungary\u00a0(1077\u20131095) as strategical point against the Second Bulgarian Empire.Romanians then fought the Ottoman Empire, which threatened the area of the Danube.\u00a0In 1247, the Hungarian Kingdom brought the Knights of St. John to the country, giving them Severin as a residence, where they built the medieval castle of Severin.\u00a0The knights withdrew in 1259, while the fortress remained in the range of the cannons of Turks, Bulgarians and Tatars who wanted to cross the Danube.\u00a0Severin fortress was the most important strategic redoubt on the Danube. Its conquest meant to gain an important bridgehead in the region.<br \/>\nIn 1524, after a devastating attack by the Turks led by Suleiman the Magnificent, only one tower of the fortress Severin was left standing, and finally\u00a0seized by the Ottoman Empire in 1524. Severin was under Ottoman rule until 1829 except Wallachian occupation between 1594 and 1599 and Austrian one between 1718 and 1738.\u00a0For nearly 300 years the fortress was rebuilt after each battle to defend Wallachia against the Hungarians and Turks.<br \/>\nAfter gaining freedom from Ottoman control in 1829, it was decided to rebuild the present city including the harbor and in the early 1900s the national road, the shipyard ands several churches were built. Severin experienced a steady economic, urban and social growth until 1972, when it received the name of <i>Drobeta-Turnu Severin<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TARGU JIU<br \/>\nL&#8217;ensemble monumental de Tirgu Jiu<\/strong>. A tentative WHS (01\/03\/1991), this ensemble of monuments by Constantin Brancusu (1876-1957) was erected between 1937-38. They were commissioned by the National League of Gorj Women and donated to the town in memory of Gorj heroes killed in WW I.<br \/>\nStarting on the banks of the Jieu River in the municipal park (big mature trees, a tower, an old ornamental fountain and a gazebo) are the concrete works \u201cTable of Silence\u201d (a 2m diameter concrete table with 12 stools around it), \u201cAlley of Stools\u201d (5 sets of 6 concrete stools lining the walkway) that connects the table with the \u201cGate of the Kiss\u201d (a large rectangular arch with two abstract lips (I think).

This 29.35m high column is composed of 15 brass clad, cast iron modules with a half module on each end. The modules are threaded down the middle with a stainless steel spine. In the 1950s, there were attempts made to destroy the column unsuccessfully. It was remetalized in 1965-66 and 1975-76 and dismantled in 1996 and restored in 2000.<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjKtqqlh9TiAhVSJFAKHTXEDHUQjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flickr.com%2Fphotos%2Fperaion%2F38789341241&amp;psig=AOvVaw0TrZ9DaSqjjPBQyipdJmhg&amp;ust=1559883006044240\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwjKtqqlh9TiAhVSJFAKHTXEDHUQjRx6BAgBEAU\" data-cthref=\"\/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjKtqqlh9TiAhVSJFAKHTXEDHUQjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flickr.com%2Fphotos%2Fperaion%2F38789341241&amp;psig=AOvVaw0TrZ9DaSqjjPBQyipdJmhg&amp;ust=1559883006044240\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4565\/38789341241_0fedd45ace_b.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Infinity Column\" width=\"242\" height=\"366\" data-iml=\"1559796640210\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Monastery of Horezu<\/strong>.

It became the capital of Romania in 1862 and is the centre of Romanian media, culture, and art. Its architecture is a mix of historical (neo-classical and Art Nouveau), interbellum (Bauhaus and art deco), communist era and modern. In the period between the two World Wars, the city&#8217;s elegant architecture and the sophistication of its elite earned Bucharest the nickname of &#8220;Little Paris&#8221; (Micul Paris). Although buildings and districts in the historic city centre were heavily damaged or destroyed by war, earthquakes, and above all Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu&#8217;s program of systematization, many survived and have been renovated.

Adding the satellite towns around the urban area, the proposed metropolitan area of Bucharest would have a population of 2.27\u00a0million people. According to Eurostat, Bucharest has a functional urban area of 2,412,530 residents (as of 2015). Bucharest is the sixth-largest city in the European Union by population within city limits, after London, Berlin, Madrid, Rome, and Paris.<br \/>\nEconomically, Bucharest is the most prosperous city in Romania.

Some medieval and renaissance edifices remain, the most notable are in the Lipscani area. This precinct contains notable buildings such as Manuc&#8217;s Inn (Hanul lui Manuc) and the ruins of the Old Court (Curtea Veche); during the late Middle Ages, this area was the heart of commerce in Bucharest. From the 1970s onwards, the area went through urban decline, and many historical buildings fell into disrepair. In 2005, the Lipscani area was pedestrianised and is undergoing restoration.<br \/>\nTo execute a massive redevelopment project during the rule of Nicolae Ceausescu, the government conducted extensive demolition of churches and many other historic structures in Romania. According to Alexandru Budistenu, former chief architect of Bucharest, &#8220;The sight of a church bothered Ceausescu. It didn&#8217;t matter if they demolished or moved it, as long as it was no longer in sight.&#8221; Nevertheless, a project organized by Romanian engineer Eugeniu Iordachescu was able to move many historic structures to less-prominent sites and save them.<br \/>\nThe city centre has retained architecture from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly the interwar period, which is often seen as the &#8220;golden age&#8221; of Bucharest architecture. During this time, the city grew in size and wealth, therefore seeking to emulate other large European capitals such as Paris. Much of the architecture of the time belongs to a Modern (rationalist) Architecture current, led by Horia Creang\u0103 and Marcel Iancu.<br \/>\nIn Romania, the tendencies of innovation in the architectural language met the need of valorisation and affirmation of the national cultural identity. The Art Nouveau movement finds expression through new architectural style initiated by Ion Mincu and taken over by other prestigious architects who capitalize important references of Romanian laic and medieval ecclesiastical architecture (for example the Mogo\u0219oaia Palace, the Stavropoleos Church or the disappeared church of V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti Monastery) and Romanian folk motifs.[85]<br \/>\nTwo notable buildings from this time are the Cre\u021bulescu Palace, housing cultural institutions including UNESCO&#8217;s European Centre for Higher Education, and the Cotroceni Palace, the residence of the Romanian President. Many large-scale constructions such as Gara de Nord, the busiest railway station in the city, National Bank of Romania&#8217;s headquarters, and the Telephone Palace date from these times. In the 2000s, historic buildings in the city centre underwent restoration. In some residential areas of the city, particularly in high-income central and northern districts, turn-of-the-20th-century villas were mostly restored beginning in the late 1990s.<br \/>\nEclectic style \u2013 CEC Palace, National Military Circle, National Museum of Romanian History.<br \/>\nFrench Baroque style \u2013 Cantacuzino Palace<br \/>\n<strong>Communist era architecture. <\/strong>A major part of Bucharest&#8217;s architecture is made up of buildings constructed during the Communist era replacing the historical architecture with high-density apartment blocks \u2013 significant portions of the historic center of Bucharest were demolished to construct one of the largest buildings in the world, the Palace of the Parliament (then officially called the House of the Republic). In Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu&#8217;s project of systematization, new buildings were built in previously historical areas, which were razed and then built upon.<br \/>\nOne of the singular examples of this type of architecture is Centrul Civic, a development that replaced a major part of Bucharest&#8217;s historic city centre with giant utilitarian buildings, mainly with marble or travertine fa\u00e7ades, inspired by North Korean architecture. The mass demolitions that occurred in the 1980s, under which an overall area of eight square kilometres of the historic center of Bucharest were leveled, including monasteries, churches, synagogues, a hospital, and a noted Art Deco sports stadium, changed drastically the appearance of the city. Communist-era architecture can also be found in Bucharest&#8217;s residential districts, mainly in blocuri, which are high-density apartment blocks that house the majority of the city&#8217;s population. Initially, these apartment blocks started to be constructed in the 1960s, on relatively empty areas and fields (good examples include Pajura, Drumul Taberei, Berceni and Titan), however with the 1970s, they mostly targeted peripheral neighborhoods such as Colentina, Pantelimon, Militari and Rahova. Construction of these apartment blocks were also often randomized, for instance some small streets were demolished and later widened with the blocks being built next to them, but other neighboring streets were left intact (like in the example of Calea Mo\u0219ilor from 1978-1982), or built in various patterns such as the Pia\u021ba Iancului-Lizeanu apartment buildings from 1962-1963.<br \/>\nThere is also communist architecture that was built in the early years of the system, in the late 1940s and 1950s. Buildings constructed in this era followed the Soviet Stalinist trend of Socialist Realism, and include the House of the Free Press (which was named Casa Sc\u00eenteii during communism).<br \/>\n<strong>Contemporary architecture. <\/strong>Since the fall of Communism in 1989, several Communist-era buildings have been refurbished, modernized, and used for other purposes. Perhaps the best example of this is the conversion of obsolete retail complexes into shopping malls and commercial centres. These giant, circular halls, which were unofficially called hunger circuses due to the food shortages experienced in the 1980s, were constructed during the Ceau\u0219escu era to act as produce markets and refectories, although most were left unfinished at the time of the revolution.<br \/>\nModern shopping malls such as the Unirea Shopping Center, Bucharest Mall, Plaza Romania, and City Mall emerged on pre-existent structures of former hunger circuses. Another example is the conversion of a large utilitarian construction in Centrul Civic into a Marriott Hotel. This process was accelerated after 2000, when the city underwent a property boom, and many Communist-era buildings in the city centre became prime real estate due to their location. Many Communist-era apartment blocks have also been refurbished to improve urban appearance.<br \/>\nThe newest contribution to Bucharest&#8217;s architecture took place after the fall of Communism, particularly after 2000, when the city went through a period of urban renewal\u00a0\u2013 and architectural revitalization\u00a0\u2013 on the back of Romania&#8217;s economic growth. Buildings from this time are mostly made of glass and steel, and often have more than 10 storeys. Examples include shopping malls (particularly the Bucharest Mall, a conversion and extension of an abandoned building), office buildings, bank headquarters, etc.<br \/>\nDuring the last ten years, several highrise office buildings were built, particularly in the northern and eastern parts of the city. Additionally, a trend to add modern wings and fa\u00e7ades to historic buildings has occurred, the most prominent example of which is the Bucharest Architects&#8217; Association Building, which is a modern glass-and-steel construction built inside a historic stone fa\u00e7ade. In 2013, the Bucharest skyline enriched with a 137-m-high office building (SkyTower of Floreasca City Center), currently the tallest building in Romania. Examples of modern skyscrapers built in the 21st century include Bucharest Tower Center, Euro Tower, Nusco Tower, Cathedral Plaza, City Gate Towers, Rin Grand Hotel, Premium Plaza, Bucharest Corporate Center, Millennium Business Center, PGV Tower, Charles de Gaulle Plaza, Business Development Center Bucharest, BRD Tower, and Bucharest Financial Plaza. Despite this development on vertical, Romanian architects avoid designing very tall buildings due to vulnerability to earthquakes.<br \/>\nAside from buildings used for business and institutions, residential developments have also been built, many of which consist of high-rise office buildings and suburban residential communities. An example of a new highrise residential complex is Asmita Gardens. These developments are increasingly prominent in northern Bucharest, which is less densely populated and is home to middle- and upper-class Bucharesters due to the process of gentrification.<\/p>\n<p><u>Day 1 and 2<br \/>\n<\/u><strong>Valea Cascadelor<\/strong>.

During the late 1500s, the Jews of Moldavia, mainly traders from Poland who were competing with locals, were taxed and ultimately expelled.\u00a0The authorities decided in 1650 and 1741 required Jews to wear clothing evidencing their status and ethnicity.\u00a0The first\u00a0blood accusation\u00a0in Moldavia was made in 1710, when the Jews of\u00a0T\u00e2rgu Neam\u021b\u00a0were charged with having killed a\u00a0Christian child for ritual purposes.\u00a0An anti-Jewish riot occurred in Bucharest in the 1760s.\u00a0During the\u00a0Russo-Turkish War, 1768-1774\u00a0the Jews in the\u00a0Danubian Principalities\u00a0had to endure great hardships. Massacres and pillages were perpetrated in almost every town and village in the country. During the\u00a0Greek War of Independence in 1821, Jews were victims of\u00a0pogroms\u00a0and\u00a0persecutions. In the 1860s, there was another riot motivated by blood libel accusations.<br \/>\nAntisemitism was officially enforced in the late 1800s applying old discrimination laws, insisting that Jews were not allowed to settle in the countryside (and relocating those that had done so), while declaring many Jewish urban inhabitants to be\u00a0vagrants\u00a0and expelling them from the country. The emigration of Romanian Jews on a larger scale commenced soon after 1878. By 1900 there were 250,000 Romanian Jews: 3.3% of the population, 14.6% of the city dwellers, 32% of the Moldavian urban population and 42% of\u00a0Ia\u0219i.<br \/>\nBetween 1940-1942, 80 anti-Jewish regulations were passed. Starting at the end of October, 1940, the\u00a0Iron Guard\u00a0began a massive antisemitic campaign, torturing and beating Jews and looting their shops (the\u00a0Dorohoi Pogrom), culminating in\u00a0the failed coup and a pogrom in Bucharest, in which 125 Jews were killed.\u00a0Antonescu eventually stopped the violence, but continued the policy of oppression and massacre of Jews, and, to a lesser extent, of\u00a0Roma. After Romania entered the war,\u00a0atrocities against the Jews became common, starting with the\u00a0Ia\u0219i pogrom. Between 280,000 and 380,000 Jews were murdered or died during the Holocaust in Romania. An additional 135,000 Jews living under\u00a0Hungarian\u00a0control in\u00a0Northern Transylvania\u00a0also perished in the Holocaust, as did some 5,000 Romanian Jews in other countries.<br \/>\nIn the current territory of Romania, between 290,000 and 360,000 Romanian Jews survived World War II.\u00a0During the\u00a0communist regime in Romania, there was a mass emigration to\u00a0Israel, and in 1987, only 23,000 Jews lived in Romania. Today, the majority of\u00a0Romanian Jews live in Israel, while modern-day Romania continues to host a modest Jewish population. In the\u00a02011 census, 3,271 declared to be Jewish.<\/p>\n<p><em>I returned to my car and had a drive-about.<br \/>\n<\/em><strong>Pia\u0163a Matache<\/strong>.

Enescu (1883-1955) was born in Romania and was a child prodigy, composing his first piece at age 5 and was the youngest student ever admitted to the Vienna Conservatory at age 10 and graduated before his 13th birthday. He then studied from 1895 to 1899 at the Conservatoire de Paris. At the age of only 16, Enescu presented in Paris his first mature work, Poema Rom\u00e2n\u0103. Many of Enescu&#8217;s works were influenced by Romanian folk music. He also wrote five symphonies, and much chamber music. In 1923 he made his American debut as a conductor and with many American orchestras. In 1939 he married Maria Rosetti (known as the Princess Cantacuzino through her first husband Mihail Cantacuzino). While staying in Bucharest, Enescu lived in the Cantacuzino Palace. He lived in Paris and in Romania, but after World War II and the Soviet occupation of Romania, he remained in Paris. On his death in 1955, George Enescu was interred in P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

This was declared the European Museum of the Year in 1996. Patronized by the Ministry of Culture, the museum preserves and exhibits numerous collections of objects and monuments of material and spiritual culture. The Museum of the Romanian Peasant holds one of the richest collections of peasant objects in Romania, its heritage being nearly 90,000 pieces, those being divided into several collections: ceramics, costumes, textiles, wooden objects, religious objects, customs, etc.<br \/>\nUnfortunately it was being renovated but temporary exhibits were shown in the nearby Tanered Barateanu Hall. The main theme here was the Karakachari people, Romanian Orthodox shepherds who spoke archaic Greek known for their seasonal migrations between winter (Aegean coast) and summer pastures (Bulgaria). With their own particular breeds of sheep, dogs and horses, they produced most of what they needed from their sheep. They now have a settled existence in Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia and Turkey and meet annually at a national gathering near Sliven Bulgaria. The museum shop is a museum unto itself with tons of traditional clothing, rugs and paraphernalia. 10 Lei<br \/>\n<strong>Village Museum &#8220;Dimitrie Gusti&#8221;.<\/strong> This open-air museum didn\u2019t close till 7pm so I was able to see it. With buildings from all over Romania, I saw several homes in the homestead section, many with outdoor ovens and kitchens. Unfortunately all but one was locked, but each had an excellent description of its providence, construction and interior.

This is the seat of the\u00a0Parliament of Romania, the\u00a0Senate and the\u00a0Chamber of Deputies. 84m high, it has a floor area of 365,000 sq. m and is heaviest building in the world, weighing about 4,098,500,000 kilograms. A colossal building, designed by 700 architects, and constructed between1984\u201397, it was built as a monument for as a kitsch style in totalitarian and modernist neoclassical architecture. The Palace was ordered by\u00a0Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu\u00a0(1918\u20131989), the dictator of\u00a0Communist Romania\u00a0during a period in which the\u00a0personality cult\u00a0of political worship and adoration was in full force for him and\u00a0his family. Known for its ornate interior composed of 23 sections, it also has three museums (National Museum of Contemporary Art, the 2015 Museum of Communist Totalitarianism\u00a0and the Museum of the Palace) and an international conference center. About 70% of the building almost four decades later still remains empty.\u00a0As of 2008, the Palace of the Parliament was valued at \u20ac3 billion euros ($3.4 billion), making it also the most expensive administrative building in the world. The cost of heating and electric use and lighting alone exceeds $6 million per year, as much as the total cost for powering a medium-sized city. It can\u2019t be accessed not even the almost empty gargantuan lot near the M of Contemporary Art.

Built between 1960-65 by his predecessor who died, Ceausescu (1918-1989) moved in immediately after he won the election and then completely redecorated it in a kitschy style with lots of gilt and white rooms. It was the family home and each of his 3 children had their own apartment. Visit virtually every room in the house including his private apartments that very few ever saw (including the famous gold bathroom fixtures \u2013 actually just gold plated \u2013 the total amount of gold amounted to only 15gms). The dressing area, just off the indoor winter garden, had many closets, at least 20 for his wife. Downstairs in this area was a solar bed, sauna, physiotherapy unit, Jacuzzi and a large swimming pool. Throughout the house are paintings of peasants, many mosaics (the shower was gold mosaic as was the part of the ceiling in the bathroom), lots of peacock images (his favourite bird, many remain on the grounds), and presents from other rulers (most were autocrats) and 11,000 he received throughout his life, especially birthday presents. The 4 bunkers under the property can only be visited on a special tour.<br \/>\nHe was famously paranoid about being poisoned \u2013 a food taster came with him on foreign trips, the fireplaces had no chimneys as he thought that would be a likely way to poison him and no air conditioning, just a ventilation system.

He was the General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party from 1965 to 1989 and hence the second and last Communist leader of Romania. He was also the country&#8217;s head of state from 1967, serving as President of the State Council and from 1974 concurrently as President of the Republic until his overthrow in the Romanian Revolution in December 1989, part of a series of anti-Communist and anti-Soviet Union uprisings in Eastern Europe that year.<br \/>\nBorn in 1918 in Scornice\u0219ti, Olt County, Ceau\u0219escu was a member of the Romanian Communist youth movement. Ceau\u0219escu rose up through the ranks of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej&#8217;s Socialist government and, upon Gheorghiu-Dej&#8217;s death in 1965, he succeeded to the leadership of Romania\u2019s Communist Party as General Secretary.<br \/>\nUpon his rise to power, he eased press censorship and openly condemned the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in his speech on 21 August 1968, which resulted in a surge in popularity. However, the resulting period of stability was very brief as his government very soon became severely totalitarian and was considered the most repressive in the Eastern Bloc at the time. His secret police, the Securitate, was responsible for mass surveillance as well as severe repression and human rights abuses within the country and he suppressed and controlled the media and press, implementing methods that were among the harshest, most restrictive and brutal in the world. Economic mismanagement due to failed oil ventures during the 1970s led to skyrocketing foreign debts for Romania. In 1982, he exported much of the country&#8217;s agricultural and industrial production in an effort to repay them. The shortages that followed drastically lowered living standards, leading to heavy rationing of food, water, oil, heat, electricity, medicine and other necessities. His cult of personality experienced unprecedented elevation, followed by extensive nepotism and the intense deterioration of foreign relations, even with the Soviet Union.<br \/>\nAs anti-government protesters demonstrated in Timi\u0219oara in December 1989, he perceived the demonstrations as a political threat and ordered military forces to open fire on 17 December, causing many deaths and injuries. The revelation that Ceau\u0219escu was responsible resulted in a massive spread of rioting and civil unrest across the country.[4] The demonstrations, which reached Bucharest, became known as the Romanian Revolution\u2014the only violent overthrow of a communist government in the turn of the Revolutions of 1989. Ceau\u0219escu and his wife Elena fled the capital in a helicopter, but they were captured by the military after the armed forces changed sides. After being tried and convicted of economic sabotage and genocide, they were immediately executed by firing squad on 25 December and Ceau\u0219escu was succeeded as President by Ion Iliescu, who had played a major part in the revolution.
