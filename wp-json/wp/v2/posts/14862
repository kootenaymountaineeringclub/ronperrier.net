A point comes when the heart cannot keep up. Blood pressure drops, inducing dizziness, stumbling, and the slurring of speech. Salt levels decline and muscles cramp. Confused, even delirious, many victims don\u2019t realize they need immediate help.<\/p>\n<p>With blood rushing to overheated skin, organs receive less flow, triggering a range of reactions that break down cells. Some victims succumb with an internal temperature of just 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius); others can withstand 107 degrees for several hours. The prognosis is usually worse for the very young and for the elderly. Even healthy older people are at a distinct disadvantage: Sweat glands shrink with age, and many common medications dull the senses. Victims often don\u2019t feel thirsty enough to drink. Sweating stops being an option, because the body has no moisture left to spare. Instead, sometimes it shivers.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--browser-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\" data-bumper-index=\"1\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/95ba87d0-5912-44c6-b22c-66e11338bcec\/STOCK-MM9365-h_15105314.jpg?w=1260&amp;h=841\" alt=\"Picture of young man cycling along a building wall covered with air-conditioning unites\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<p class=\"Caption__Title\" aria-hidden=\"false\">NEW DELHI, INDIA<\/p>\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">Air conditioners festoon the facades of apartment buildings in the Indian capital.

Italy fared even worse, with nearly 20,000. Across the continent, more than 70,000 people\u2014most of them poor, isolated, and elderly\u2014lost their lives. Europe\u2019s hottest summer in 500 years, scientists later determined, was clearly linked to climate change. In Paris it had raised the risk of heat-related mortality that year by about 70 percent.\u00a0<i>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/science\/article\/the-decade-we-finally-woke-up-to-climate-change\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Past decade was the hottest on record.<\/a>)<\/i><\/p>\n<p>Among the many climatic threats that scientists associate with global warming\u2014stronger and more destructive hurricanes, drought, rising sea levels, longer fire seasons\u2014an uptick in heat waves is the most intuitive and immediate. As greenhouse gases released by human activities continue to increase in the atmosphere, heat waves will become longer and individual days will become hotter. Globally, the past six years have been the warmest ever recorded. In the southwestern United States, days with triple-digit temperatures are arriving weeks earlier than they did a century ago and lingering three weeks longer. And in Europe, the dreadful summer of 2003 has proved to be no mere statistical blip: Major heat waves have hit the continent five times since then, and 2019 brought all-time temperature records in six western European countries, including 114.8\u00b0F in France.<\/p>\n<p>The ultimate solution to global warming, of course, is to drastically reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. If we fail utterly to do that, by 2100 the heat-related death toll could rise above 100,000 a year in the U.S. Elsewhere the threat is far greater: In India, for example, the death toll could reach 1.5 million, according to recent research. And even if we do rein in emissions, the planet will continue to warm for decades. A juggernaut is in motion, and it will fundamentally change how most of the planet lives.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--browser-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\" data-bumper-index=\"7\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/2219272a-3cac-45a7-9253-60810df39c35\/STOCK-MM9365-h-11_02672184.jpg?w=1260&amp;h=840\" alt=\"Picture of people in white clothes walking under umbrellas\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<p class=\"Caption__Title\" aria-hidden=\"false\">MECCA, SAUDI ARABIA<\/p>\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate\"><span class=\"RichText\">COVID-19 restrictions thinned the crowds circling in the Great Mosque in July 2020.

Unsurprisingly, it also regularly records the most heat-related deaths. In 2020, Maricopa County logged an all-time-record 207, according to its medical examiner\u2019s office, which occupies a two-story, desert-tone building in downtown Phoenix and is required by law to investigate all nonnatural deaths, which include those related to temperature.<\/p>\n<p>When a potentially heat-related death is reported, says Melanie Rouse, the office\u2019s chief investigator, her staff first interviews anyone with recent knowledge of the decedent. Was she or he sweating profusely or not at all, complaining of headache or nausea? Doing yard work? Using alcohol or drugs, which interfere with thermoregulation? \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to find out,\u201d Rouse says, \u201cis what led to this turn in their life. We\u2019re trying to see if there are other compelling causes of death.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At the death scene, investigators measure the temperature of the body and the room. (The highest indoor temperature they\u2019ve recorded was 145\u00b0F in 2017.) They extract vitreous fluid from the victim\u2019s eyeball for chemical analysis. Cells break down quickly in high heat, explains Rouse, \u201cbut the globe of the eyeball is a protected space.\u201d Chemists and physicians will analyze this fluid to determine if the decedent was dehydrated, had high blood sugar, or had decreased kidney function\u2014all of which increase susceptibility to heat.<\/p>\n<p>Slightly more than half of Maricopa County\u2019s heat-related deaths occur outdoors, mostly among the homeless. Many of the indoor deaths occur in mobile homes, whose poor insulation makes them hard to cool. Even in the richest of countries, inadequate housing contributes massively to heat exposure. In poorer countries, matters are far worse.<\/p>\n<p>In India, when the temperature surpasses 105\u00b0, government agencies advise people to stay inside and drink cool water. But the advice is not helpful to the tens of millions whose homes are hotter inside than out, who lack electricity to operate fans or misters\u2014only 8 percent of Indian households have air-conditioning\u2014or who, like Noor Jehan, don\u2019t have homes at all.<\/p>\n<p>Jehan, 36, has lived outdoors, in a South Delhi park, all her life. Every morning she stacks her meager belongings\u2014a sack of bedding, a few pots and bowls\u2014near a concrete perimeter wall, then trudges to her job at a construction site. She works even when the thermometer reaches 118\u00b0. Like millions of other daily wage laborers, she can\u2019t feed her three children if she skips work. \u201cWhen I come back home,\u201d she says, \u201cthere\u2019s no water to even take a bath to clean the grime and dust and cool down.\u201d Her drinking water source is more than a mile away.<\/p>\n<p>Jehan\u2019s husband pulls a rickshaw, but, undernourished and dehydrated, he frequently faints in the heat. Her sister Afsana and her three children cope by placing mats on the sidewalks, to rest or even sleep. \u201cThe passing cars create a bit of breeze,\u201d Afsana says.

But in many places it\u2019s becoming a public health necessity, essential for preventing heat-related deaths. The good news, according to the Climate Impact Lab, a consortium of climate researchers, is that by 2099 economic development is expected to increase both air conditioner use and access to health care, saving millions of lives a year. The International Energy Agency projects that the number of AC room units will soar to 5.6 billion by mid-century, from 1.6 billion today.<\/p>\n<p>The bad news is that current air-conditioning technology exacts a steep price on the planet. In most systems a liquid refrigerant is pumped through an evaporation coil within the indoor part of an AC unit; as the liquid changes to gas inside the coil, it pulls heat and moisture from the air. Outside the building a compressor, a condenser, and a fan convert the gas back to a liquid, releasing the heat and the condensed water.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--browser-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\" data-bumper-index=\"16\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/48bb91c8-e22f-46ab-8333-f176b803e7a2\/MM9365_200908_011404.jpg?w=1260&amp;h=840\" alt=\"Picture of workers with headlight picking tomatoes in dark\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<p class=\"Caption__Title\" aria-hidden=\"false\">CALIFORNIA, U.S.<\/p>\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">In Los Banos, in the San Joaquin Valley, tomato pickers start at 5 a.m. to avoid some of the day\u2019s heat.

Second, conventional air conditioners don\u2019t make heat vanish; they just dump it outside. In Phoenix, according to one study, ACs raise the outdoor temperature at night by as much as two degrees Fahrenheit, forcing all units to work even harder.<\/p>\n<p>And third, air conditioners suck huge amounts of electricity\u2014about 8.5 percent of total global consumption. Most of that energy is still produced by burning fossil fuels. In 2016 air-conditioning accounted for 1.25 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions; by 2050, that number is expected to nearly double.<\/p>\n<p>Clearly, new ideas are needed. To stimulate them, the Rocky Mountain Institute, a Colorado-based think tank, recently helped run an international competition. It challenged engineers to produce a room air conditioner that has one-fifth the climate impact of today\u2019s standard products, uses at most one-fourth the energy, and is no more than twice as expensive as a current baseline model.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--browser-width InlineElement--desktop ImageGroup__Wrapper\" aria-label=\"Image Pair\" data-bumper-index=\"18\">\n<div class=\"ImageGroup__Images\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure id=\"image-pair-california_0\" class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/faaec683-4838-4093-852a-1a9b01f0857a\/MM9365_200827_001776.jpg?w=1260&amp;h=840\" alt=\"Picture of woman taking a break under grape vines\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure id=\"image-pair-california_1\" class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/48b0d11f-a369-408d-a501-2be4c338d6bb\/MM9365_200905_007659.jpg?w=1260&amp;h=840\" alt=\"Picture of man holding a large photo portrait\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption Caption--hideEndBug\">\n<p class=\"Caption__Title\" aria-hidden=\"false\">LEFT: CALIFORNIA, U.S.<\/p>\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">On a 98\u00b0F day in Caruthers, California, near Fresno, Marina Acosta takes a break from picking grapes that will be dried for raisins.

The co-champions, designed by Team Daikin and Team Gree, cool their condensers with water instead of air to reduce their energy demand, and one sports solar panels to supply some of its electricity. They are expected to be on store shelves by 2025, at about twice the price of the baseline model. But their operating costs are so low, Campbell says, that the payback period will be just three years.<\/p>\n<div class=\"EmbedInline\">\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--content-width InlineElement--desktop\" aria-label=\"source\">\n<div class=\"static--source\">\n<div class=\"ngm-2107-heat-bodygraphic\">\n<div id=\"ngm-2107-heat-bodygraphic_primary\" class=\"ng-graphic-wrap\">\n<div id=\"g-ngm-2107-heat-bodygraphic_primary_ai2html-box\" class=\"ai2html\">\n<div id=\"g-ngm-2107-heat-bodygraphic_primary_ai2html-desktop-small\" class=\"g-artboard\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.474\" data-min-width=\"636\">\n<div id=\"g-ai1-1\" class=\"g-TEXT g-aiAbs g-aiPointText\">\n<p class=\"g-pstyle0\"><strong>HOW THE BODY HANDLES HEAT\u00a0<\/strong>Maintaining a constant internal temperature of about 98.6\u00b0F is a balancing act. Muscles and organs generate heat that is shed through the skin. But the body also absorbs heat from the environment. A warming climate is exposing almost a third of the world\u2019s population to potentially deadly heat.<br \/>\nA system for cooling off. The body transfers heat to anything it touches, including clothes and the surrounding air. Heat radiating from the skin and sweat evaporating from it provide most of the body\u2019s cooling.<br \/>\nThermoreceptors on skin &#8211; HEAT STRESS IS DETECTED<br \/>\nHypothalamus. Receptors in the skin and other parts of the body sense that a person is starting to overheat. Climate, activity level, and clothing can all affect internal temperature.<br \/>\nVasodilation rushes blood to skin<br \/>\nTHE BODY\u2019S THERMOSTAT TAKES NOTE. The brain\u2019s hypothalamus signals eccrine glands in the skin to release sweat\u2014up to three pounds an hour. Only about 5 percent of the 2.5 million glands are active at any given time.<br \/>\nEvaporating sweat cools skin<br \/>\nTHE BODY\u2019S THERMOSTAT TAKES NOTE. Blood vessels dilate, funneling more blood into capillaries in the skin. This vasodilation carries heat from the body\u2019s core to its surface, where it can be radiated away.<br \/>\nBLOOD AND SWEAT COOL THE BODY. Blood and sweat dissipate the vast majority of body heat through the skin; breath carries away most of the rest. Sweat cools when it evaporates, which can be nearly impossible in high humidity.<br \/>\nWhen things go wrong. The longer blood and fluids are diverted to cool the skin, the harder it is on our internal organs. In extreme heat, stress can progress to exhaustion and then stroke\u2014and ultimately to death.<br \/>\nHEATSTROKE. HEAT EXHAUSTION. Headache, confusion, vomiting, and loss of consciousness can occur when the body hits 104\u00b0F. Heatstroke requires emergency care. It can quickly damage the brain, heart, kidneys, and muscles and end in coma and death.<br \/>\nNausea, fatigue, cramps, rash, and dizziness\u2014often caused by a combination of high temperatures, physical exertion, and high humidity\u2014are signals the body sends to the brain to reduce activity and cool down. These symptoms can progress to more deadly heatstroke.<\/p>\n<p class=\"g-pstyle0\"><b>At Princeton University<\/b>\u00a0in New Jersey, Forrest Meggers, an architect and engineer, is developing another type of system that might prove enormously helpful in hot and humid environments. It didn\u2019t meet the criteria for the Rocky Mountain Institute competition, though, because it doesn\u2019t cool a room\u2019s air: It cools only people\u2014by absorbing the heat that radiates from their skin with wall-mounted panels of water-filled tubes.<br \/>\nA prototype of the invention, called Cold Tube, hangs from a hook in Meggers\u2019s lab. It resembles a woven mat of blue plastic straws. On an 85\u00b0 day like today, Meggers explains during my visit, filling those skinny tubes with 60\u00b0 water would give lab occupants a feeling of 75\u00b0, even with the lab\u2019s sliding doors wide open because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, the tubes aren\u2019t filled on this muggy afternoon. Meggers is dressed head to toe in wicking clothing.<br \/>\nArchitects have employed radiative cooling panels before, on ceilings and on walls, but almost always with dehumidifiers, to keep water from condensing on the panels and raining down on computers and heads. By shrouding his panels with a simple polyethylene membrane, which keeps humid air away from the tubes but not radiated heat, Meggers says, he has solved that problem.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\" data-bumper-index=\"21\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/cbf098bb-1be6-4cdd-a558-62c086e911a1\/MM9365_200815_01006.jpg?w=1280&amp;h=853\" alt=\"Picture of woman in black head cover calming a little child to sleep\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<p class=\"Caption__Title\" aria-hidden=\"false\">KARBALA, IRAQ<\/p>\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">In Karbala, Iraq, a mother with just a small fan struggles to soothe her child suffering from heat rash on a 109\u00b0F day.

The energy savings aren\u2019t quite as spectacular in arid environments, where ACs don\u2019t work so hard to dehumidify air. But the membrane-insulated radiative panels, Meggers says, are still more efficient than conventional systems.<\/p>\n<p>Because the panels cool human bodies, not huge volumes of air, they could work well even in outdoor settings, such as bus shelters or caf\u00e9s. The biggest challenge to wider adoption of the technology, Meggers suspects, is attitudinal. \u201cEngineers are accustomed to thinking about summertime comfort and cooling in terms of air-conditioning,\u201d he says. Adapting to a hotter world is going to require a paradigm shift, and not just among engineers.<\/p>\n<p><b>New York City, where I live,<\/b>\u00a0ranks its neighborhoods\u2019 vulnerability to heat based on risk factors such as poverty, access to air-conditioning, and availability of green space.

Their buildings are older and leakier, Jessel says, and their living conditions may be more crowded. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to work or study in the air-conditioned living room and there\u2019s three noisy people there,\u201d she says, \u201cyou move to another room and turn on another AC.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>We head east.

People in less animated neighborhoods were far less likely to step outside for relief or visit with caring neighbors, he surmised, because they didn\u2019t know one another, had few places to go, and were sometimes scared to walk the streets. And so they stayed inside\u2014often with windows closed to guard against burglars\u2014sweltered, and died.<\/p>\n<p>Like many cities around the world, New York operates several dozen cooling centers: libraries, schools, senior centers, and other buildings that open their doors to the public during heat waves. In New York the centers are closed at night, and many people who might find relief in such places aren\u2019t aware they exist. Some refuse to visit them for fear their empty apartments will be burgled, as Klinenberg found in Chicago. In Phoenix, homeless people would rather roast in tent cities on asphalt parking lots than leave their worldly goods behind while seeking indoor relief, says Ash Uss, advocacy coordinator of that city\u2019s Andr\u00e9 House of Hospitality.<\/p>\n<p>Getting people into those air-conditioned spaces will save lives, as ASU\u2019s David Hondula noted. But reducing social isolation may be equally important. In New York, Black residents die of heat-related causes at twice the rate that white ones do, but whites succumb at three times the rate of Hispanics and five times the rate of Asians\u2014in part perhaps because whites are more likely to live alone.<\/p>\n<p>Coping with extreme heat is more complicated than it sounds because it\u2019s a nested problem, inseparable from larger social issues. But that\u2019s also its silver lining: If we improve the lives of the most vulnerable among us, we also will improve our resilience to extreme heat.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--browser-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\" data-bumper-index=\"26\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/cb2a5503-5f86-4e94-96c2-afe65c51dddd\/STOCK-MM9365-DSCF0253.jpg?w=1260&amp;h=840\" alt=\"Picture of man on motorbike by campsite in the desert at night\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<p class=\"Caption__Title\" aria-hidden=\"false\">DASHT-E LUT, IRAN<\/p>\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">Nomads make camp in the Lut Desert, which isn\u2019t as lifeless as it looks.

It triggered national reckonings, endless finger-pointing, and major reforms. Within a year, France mandated \u201ccool rooms\u201d in previously un-air-conditioned nursing homes, launched telephone check-in systems for the vulnerable, beefed up heat-warning systems, and inaugurated a massive public education campaign on preventing heatstroke. When high temperatures returned, such measures were credited with reducing mortality 10-fold.<\/p>\n<p>We know for certain that high temperatures will keep returning and that air conditioners alone won\u2019t eliminate all heat deaths. People still need and want to go outside.<\/p>\n<p>And so in hot cities around the world, crews are planting shade trees and creeping vines to block sunlight. They\u2019re painting rooftops; installing rooftop gardens; erecting shade structures on sidewalks and in parks; hooking up misters and spray showers in playgrounds; and experimenting with roughly textured permeable pavement, which cools surrounding air by absorbing and then evaporating rainwater. In New York City, researchers from Columbia University\u2019s Earth Institute calculated that planting trees over 17 percent of the city\u2019s land surface and treating all roofs to reflect, rather than absorb, solar radiation could lower the city\u2019s overall temperature by 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or nearly a degree Celsius.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know if these tools will be enough to survive another half degree [Celsius] of warming,\u201d let alone the projected three degrees (5.4 degrees F) by century\u2019s end, says Kristie Ebi, who studies the impact of global warming on human health at the University of Washington. \u201cBut doing nothing is certainly not sufficient.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Rethinking how we build will be key to surviving a warmer future. Up until the mid-20th century, most buildings were developed with the climate in mind. In warmer latitudes, architects incorporated transoms, cupolas, skylights, air shafts, and operable windows to promote cross ventilation and updrafts. Awnings, light-filtering screens, louvered shades, overhangs, and porches defended rooms against the sun. Ceiling fans, which use up to a thousand times less energy than a room air conditioner, were ubiquitous. But as the cachet and influence of modernist architecture\u2014with its inoperable windows and curtain walls of aluminum and glass\u2014spread from the U.S. and Europe around the globe, so did dependence on mechanical air-conditioning.<\/p>\n<p>Climate-savvy architecture is starting to be a thing again. But we still have to live in the cities that are already built. We\u2019re not likely to tear down or substantially retrofit hundreds of thousands of poorly insulated, energy-intensive towers. Instead, suggests architect Daniel Barber, of the University of Pennsylvania, we might try to retrofit our expectations.<\/p>\n<p>Now is the time, Barber says, to \u201ccondition ourselves to embrace, and even value, discomfort.\u201d Being a little too warm in summertime used to be something that even the affluent accepted, perhaps with the help of an iced beverage. Barber thinks we should learn to accept it again. In this paradigm the lavish chill of our conference rooms, or the \u201cthermal delight\u201d that greets the sweaty pedestrian as the doors to a high-end emporium whoosh open, would become artifacts of a fleeting late 20th-century insanity.<\/p>\n<p>In Barber\u2019s vision, the energy-hogging global North, where excess comfort abounds, would transfer its ration of \u201cthermal wealth\u201d to the energy-impoverished global South, at least until we\u2019ve given up fossil fuels. It would be a sort of comfort reparations\u2014for having started climate change in the first place. \u201cArchitects already have the tools and knowledge to reduce our reliance on mechanical cooling,\u201d Barber says. Their project now is to make discomfort culturally desirable, even stylish.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, style gets one only so far. Self-imposed discomfort will be a hard ethic to sell to a mass audience in wealthy countries, and even Barber\u2014a provocateur with a serious point\u2014recognizes the limits of the human body. \u201cWhen it\u2019s 140 degrees, I hope to God I have an air conditioner, and that you do too,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when it\u2019s 85 out, please just open the window.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<\/article>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Too hot to live: Millions worldwide will face unbearable temperatures A warming climate is likely to push entire regions out of their comfort zones\u2014and make staying cool a matter of survival.
