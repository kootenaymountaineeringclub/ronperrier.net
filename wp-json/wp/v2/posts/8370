As much of our weather approaches from the west, you can get a good idea of what systems are in the offering for our area from this forecast.

Here are some questions that come up all the time in winter. What\u2019s it like up at the XC ski area? Is the snow any good? Paulson xc doesn\u2019t have cell phone coverage, and the report is generally a day old, and things may well have changed. How much new snow is there up at the pass? What is the condition of it? How is it likely to change in the next couple of days, like between now and my planned trip on Saturday? Here are some of the sites I use, that give me useful info on what to expect. Because, being the weather, It will likely be different from what it was a few days ago when you were there\u2026..or maybe it won\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Drivebc.ca.<\/strong> Current temperature, snowfall since the last measurement, and the previous 12 hours, snow depth. Camera. If there\u2019s snow on the trees\u2026. Good sign. You may notice if it\u2019s melted off. Not a good sign if there\u2019s been snowfall recently. The road often melts when the snow isn\u2019t melting, since they\u2019re using salt on it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>U of Washington Weather Radar<\/strong> composite https:\/\/www.atmos.washington.edu\/weather\/radar.shtml tells you if it\u2019s precipitating, and where the precipitation is. Takes a bit of interpretation\/ interpolation. The West Kootenay falls between the Spokane and Silverstar radar, so precipitation in this area sometimes doesn\u2019t show up all that well\u2026You can interpolate in the gap. Doesn\u2019t tell you if it\u2019s snowing or raining. There are other ones like intellicast that have an algorithm that does.<br \/>\nSatellite imagery Pacific infrared image from U of W. Shows you what\u2019s coming at us from the Pacific. The colour is the cloud top temperature, or surface temperature if there\u2019s no cloud. The thicker the cloud, the colder it is, generally, but most of the juice is in the lower half of the atmosphere. https:\/\/atmos.washington.edu\/~ovens\/wxloop.cgi? ir_common_full+12<\/p>\n<p>Pacific Visible Image\u2026 Great for during the day. Easier to interpret than the IR. https:\/\/atmos.washington.edu\/~ovens\/wxloop.cgi? vis_common+12<\/p>\n<p>More U W Weather loops\u2026Geek out if you feel the urge for more weather info\u2026 https:\/\/atmos.washington.edu\/~ovens\/loops\/ (Geek Alert) I use this page every day for a quick and dirty look at what the model projections are. Useful things are the precipitation envelope on the surface panel, and the 850 millibar temperature, which basically tells you where the freezing level is going to be. The models are very good at the upper levels! 850 millibars is approximately 5k feet or 1500 metres (Strawberry Pass!) http:\/\/mp1.met.psu.edu\/~fxg1\/ewall.html GFS is the American model. CMC is the Canadian one. They\u2019re generally available around 8 PM in the evening for the 00z run, and the same time in the morning for the 12Z one. One hour later in daylight saving time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>spotwx.com.<\/strong> You pick out a spot, choose a model, and get the projections for how much precipitation, temperature, sometimes freezing level, winds (not reliable) etc for the spot you pick. Remember that the spots are model heights, and the model smooths the terrain, so check out the model height you picked and correct the temperature for the difference as best you can. The average lapse rate is about 5 deg per km but it varies from 10 deg\/km (summer or behind cold fronts) to inversionary. The really nice thing about spots is that you can get a login name and it will remember the points you\u2019ve chosen for your model output. Also, remember that the long-range models like the GFS and Global tend to overdo the precip a little bit.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>avalanche.ca\/weather\/forecast<\/strong> If you want a good weather discussion of ski weather for the week ahead\u2026 you can\u2019t do much better. Nice graphics, and enthusiasm. Some nice educational videos from David Jones, of EC, as well. I\u2019ve not mentioned avi hazard here. Obviously the more it snows, the more hazard, more so if it warms up and there are weak layers buried.
