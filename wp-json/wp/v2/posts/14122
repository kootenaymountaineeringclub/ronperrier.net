First, they authenticate you as a \u201creal person\u201d. Then, a hard-working committee spends hours or days verifying the traveller in two separate categories: United Nations countries and Nomad Mania 1301 Regions. These \u201cqualifications\u201d are listed next to your name in Nomad Mania by various badges. Supreme verification repeats this country and region verification yearly.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Other measures of travel are World Heritage Sites + Tentative WHS, the NM Series General Ranking (listing over 66,000 places) and NM&#8217;s TBT (The Biggest Traveller). TBT may be the most reliable measure of travel as it takes into account all ranking systems and includes 21 categories of items. I am #11.

For my first major trip, a friend and I stuck out our thumbs from Victoria in 1964 with the intention of going around the world. We had $30 between us. When we ran out of money we worked at whatever we could get. That lasted about a year until I ran into a girl and got married, which put a damper on travel for too many years. I have a 1957 Rolls Royce that I drove around the world in 2007, then from Victoria Canada to Alaska &amp; the Canadian Yukon in 2009, then through Central and South America and back in 2011. I\u2019ve driven it through 49 countries and all the Canadian provinces and continental US states.
