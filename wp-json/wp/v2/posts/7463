They returned by circumventing Blacktail on the south and east, passing over the rib north of Blacktail to the lakes. It was a 9-hour day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">TITEI, BLACKTAIL, FISHERMAIDEN <\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">by Kim Kratky\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Next, Peter and I went scrambling up Silverton Creek on the 16th.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The road is open now to the Fishermaiden Lake trailhead (good quality 4WD, a little bushy at the top end; probably could do it in 2WD). We hiked the Fishermaiden Lake trail (20 min.) and found it easy to follow but overgrown with stinging nettle and other such crap before we got into the timber. There are some deadfalls, but it&#8217;s not bad.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Probably not worth working on right now. However, the signs at the trailhead are in bad shape making the BCFS look kind of derelict. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Now the really interesting thing is that after about 10 min. walk on the trail, we encountered a sign pointing to the Billy Valentine Trail off to the L. There was flagging but you couldn&#8217;t see the trail in the vegetation, so we laughed and pushed on to the lake. We then bushwhacked SE up from the lake (5300&#8242;), staying on the N. side of that creek that flows into the E. side of the lake. After 65 min. of moderate struggle, we came across this wonderful trail and followed it to a destroyed cabin near the lake at 848-239 (Slocan 82F\/14). We figured this must be the Billy Valentine Trail and cabin, as I found out later that he&#8217;s listed as an area prospector on that big sign located just at the beginning of Silverton Creek Road. Refreshed and out of the bush, we continued SE, skirting the upper lake on the N. and headed for Titei&#8217;s NW face. This we did on snow leading to a high-quality scramble on good granite for the last few hundred feet. 3.5 hrs. to the 8405&#8242; summit&#8211;remarkably similar time and altitude to those of the Chipman trip.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">After an hour&#8217;s lounging, we headed SE to the next bump (35 min., 8250&#8242;, 855-227). From there, we descended the SW ridge of 8250&#8242; (saw two goats at very close range) and dropped into the upper reaches of White Heather Basin before ascending Blacktail Mtn. by an easy S. ridge (rock much more crumbly than on Titei&#8211;more like that on Virgil). Blacktail has a series of formidable-looking molars on its NE side; they may not be that hard, but we had no rope. We reached Blacktail (8176&#8242;) just before 3:00 and hung around for 30 min.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">On our return, we traversed around the SE side of Blacktail, went through a col just NE of the peak, crossed a ridge running NW from Wilfred Ridge at about 846-233, and descended on snow to a point between the two lakes we had passed on our ascent. After contouring the SW side of the lower lake, we crossed the creek at its outlet point and came across a mine and tailings (Billy&#8217;s mine, we reckon).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">We found no connecting trail between the mine and cabin, but after 5-10 minutes of searching, we picked up the trail and followed it right down to its junction with the Fishermaiden Lake trail (2 hrs. 10 min. from the top of Blacktail to the car park). The trail is in good condition with excellent flagging except where it passes through a rock slide below the tree line. As well, the bottom 200 meters are indistinguishable from the vegetation and have to be negotiated almost entirely by reading flagging. Deadfalls are present but not at all bad. Somewhere around 6500&#8242; on the trail we came across a small metal plaque affixed to a tree. This looked like a claim marker but was a BCFS record of trail assessment, the most recent date showing 8\/28\/94.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">I talked to Dave Fitchett by phone about this trail. He knew of its existence but had never been on it. Information about it was supplied to the BCFS by Nancy Anderson who lives near Silverton. You and Dave might want to take a hike into this area. It&#8217;s quite attractive, especially the upper lake which has an island in the middle of it.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">As a sidebar to all this and another negative reflection on Parks BC, I called their West Kootenay office for information about access to Wee Sandy Lake. Steve Kent was away, so I got some guy named Dan Harlowe. Know him? Anyway, he wasn&#8217;t very helpful about access to Wee Sandy and didn&#8217;t want to hear about the Billy Valentine, even though it does give access to Kokanee Glacier Park (Blacktail is in the park, at least on my maps it is). I got the feeling that Mr. Harlowe&#8217;s philosophy is that parks are not for people but instead for protecting animals, and that whatever knowledge these guys do have they don&#8217;t want to share it. I do understand and respect this point of view, but I&#8217;m just not in total sympathy with it.
