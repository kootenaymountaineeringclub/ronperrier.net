Situated just below the eastern Himalayan foothills, it is surrounded by the states of\u00a0Arunachal Pradesh,\u00a0Nagaland,\u00a0Manipur,\u00a0Mizoram,\u00a0Tripura\u00a0and\u00a0Meghalaya, which together with Assam are known collectively as the\u00a0seven sisters.<br \/>\nWith an area of 78,438 square kilometres, Assam is almost equivalent to the size of\u00a0Ireland\u00a0or\u00a0Austria. Assam shares international borders with\u00a0Bhutan\u00a0and\u00a0Bangladesh\u00a0and the international borders of\u00a0China\u00a0and\u00a0Myanmar\u00a0are within 80 to 100km.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Understand<br \/>\n<\/strong>Assam has been a world leader in the production of tea for more than one hundred years and currently produces around 25 percent of the world&#8217;s tea. Traditionally it is a producer of high quality silk, locally called\u00a0paat\u00a0bred on mulberry leaves, and the only place in the world where all four major silk types are cultivated, the others being the golden silk\u00a0Muga\u00a0unique to Assam , the Ahimsa silk Eri bred on castor leaves, and\u00a0tassar.<br \/>\nIt has the highest reserves of oil and natural gas after Bombay High and Gujarat. Along with neighbouring Arunachal, it has the richest biodiversity in India.<\/p>\n<p><strong>History.\u00a0<\/strong>Leaving Manipur and Tripura, rest of these states are carved out from Assam during 1960s and 70s and Sylhet, a district of Assam was annexed with\u00a0Bangladesh\u00a0during partition of British India (1947).<br \/>\nAssam was known as the Kingdom of Pragjyotisha-Kamarupa during the first millenium AD and was broken into smaller states during the beginning of the second millenium; however, later, after 13th century for next six hundred years the region again transformed into a united sovereign country as the Kingdom of Assam under the later dynasties such as the Ahoms and Koches. Despite being an archaeologically and historically rich region, Assam is still a terra-incognito to the world.<br \/>\nAssam is also rich in history and archaeology. In the ancient times, the Kingdom of Pragjyotisha-Kamarupa under at least three successive dynasties for more than 700 years and in the medieval periods the Kingdom of Assam under the Ahoms for 600 years were strong and sovereign kingdoms; no western powers including the great Mughals could invade and occupy the region till the British had come. Apart from several failed attempts by the north Indian kingdoms in the ancient times, the Mughals attempted invading Assam for 17 times, where only once they could get little success in occupying and controlling a major portion only for a small period of two years. Mughals were defeated and completely thrown out from the Brahmaputra Valley in the 17th century. However, Mughals had maintained control on the western territories (now North Bengal) of the Koch Kingdom and in some parts of the Jayantiya Kingdom (a tributary ruler under the Ahoms) &#8211; now in Bangladesh. Due to richness and self-sustained nature of the kingdoms in Assam, the rulers hardly attempted any outward aggression leaving only few instances. During the rule of Barman Dynasty of Kamarupa the king Bhaskarvarman occupied the then Gauda (later Bengal) along with its capital city Karnasuvarna in the 7th century; then a major portion of present eastern Bangladesh was a natural part of Kamarupa. In the 17th century, a plan for reoccupying the lost land of the ancient Kamarupa kingdom and destroying the Nawab of Gauda by the Ahom king Rudra Simha was thwarted after the king&#8217;s sudden death during his organisation of a large amry of 4 hundred thousand in Guwahati. With such a historic background, Assam possesses hundreds of historic and archaeological sites, where extensive research opportunities and tourism potentials are still left.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Terrain<\/strong>. Assam and surrounding regions have to be a paradise for the nature lovers and researchers. The region&#8217;s unique natural settings, hydro-geomorphic environment and biodiversity have no parallel in\u00a0Asia. Within a eighty to hundred kilometres of journey by land, one can travel from a flat flood plain with tropical rainforests and wet paddy fields to mountainous regions of Alpine-Himalayan climatic conditions at very high altitude. Geomorphic studies conclude that the Brahmaputra, the life-line of Assam is a paleo-river; older than the Himalayas. The river with steep gorges and rapids in Arunachal Pradesh entering Assam, becomes a braided river (at times 16 km wide) and with tributaries, creates a flood plain (Brahmaputra Valley: 80-100 km wide, 1000 km long).<br \/>\nThe hills of Karbi Anglong, North Cachar and those in and close to Guwahati (also Khasi-Garo Hills) now eroded and dissected are originally parts of the South Indian Plateau system. In the south, the Barak originating in the Barail Range (Assam-Nagaland border), flows through the Cachar district with a 40-50km wide valley and confluences with the Brahmaputra in Bangladesh.<br \/>\nAssam is one of the richest biodiversity zones in the world and consists of tropical rainforests, deciduous forests, riverine grasslands, bamboo orchards and numerous wetland ecosystems; Many are now protected as national parks and reserved forests. The Kaziranga, home of the rare Rhinoceros, and Manas are two\u00a0UNESCO World Heritage Sites\u00a0in Assam. Pabitora has the highest density of rhinos. The reserve forests of Joypur, Upper Dihing and Dirak are a stretch of pristine rainforests. The region is the last refuge for numerous other endangered species such as Golden Langur or Honali Bandor (Trachypithecus geei), White-winged Wood Duck or Deohanh (Cairina scutulata), Bengal Florican or Ulumora, Black-breasted Parrotbill, Pygmy Hog or Nolgahori, Greater Adjutant or Hargila, Hispid Hare or Khagorikota, Slow Loris or Lajuki Bandor, Swamp Francolin or Koira and so on. Some other endangered species with significant population in Assam are Tiger, Elephant, Hoolock Gibbon, Jerdon&#8217;s Babbler and so on. Assam is also known for orchids the more well known being the foxtail or kopou and blue vanda or bhatou.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Climate.\u00a0<\/strong>With the \u201cTropical Monsoon Rainforest Climate\u201d, Assam is temperate (Summer max. at 35-38 and winter min. at 6-8 degrees Celsius) and experiences heavy rainfall and high humidity. However, temperature is much lesser in the hilly areas in the Central Assam. The climate is characterised by heavy monsoon downpours reducing summer temperature and foggy nights and mornings in winter . Thunderstorms known as Bordoicila are frequent during the afternoons. Spring (Mar-Apr) and Autumn (Sept-Oct) are usually pleasant with moderate rainfall and temperature.<br \/>\nThe region is prone to natural disasters with annual floods (in specific areas) and frequent mild earthquakes. Floods usually occur during monsoon (mid June till late August) and many a times can create trouble by destroying roads and railway linkages at places. Strong earthquakes are rare; three of these were recorded in 1869, 1897 (8.1 on the Richter scale); and in 1950.<br \/>\n<strong>Cultural heritage.\u00a0<\/strong>Assam can be termed a crucible of cultures. It is a meeting place of South Asian and South East Asian cultures, where the principal language Assamese (Oxomeeya) exhibits hybridity between Indo-Iranian, Tibeto-Burman and Tai-Kadai group of languages. Apart from the hybrid Assamese population, there are several distinct ethno-cultural groups such as Bodo, Karbi, Mishing, Dimasa, Tiwa, Rabha, Hasong, Taiphake, Taikhamti, Taiaiton, Singphow, Bru, Garo, etc with distinct languages, dialects, food habits, architecture and settlement pattern, textile design, dance, music, musical instruments, beliefs, etc.Tourism.<br \/>\nIt is important to understand that in the past 60 years, the Government of India&#8217;s restrictions on the foreigners in the region such as the Restricted Area Permit System (RAP &#8211; finally abolished in Assam and neighbouring Meghalaya in the 1990s), acted as major hindrances for the foreign tourists and foreign interest groups to legally enter in to Assam and gradually pushed Assam in to isolation from the world. Assam today is a terra-incognito to the new generations in the developed world; while the old generation British, other Europeans, Americans and Japanese still remember &#8216;Assam&#8217; whatever may be the cause varying from colonial administration, to tea and oil industry or to WWII. For past 60 years, tourism promotion and development was a neglected subject.<br \/>\n<strong>Talk.\u00a0<\/strong>Assamese is the principal language and the lingua-franca in the region. Assamese and Bodo are the local official languages in Assam and Bengali. Most educated people speak English and\u00a0Hindi\u00a0with local tunes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GET IN<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>By plane. <\/strong>There is good air-connectivity to Assam from the major cities in India. Guwahati&#8217;s\u00a0Lokapriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport\u00a0is the busiest in Assam and other major airports are in\u00a0Dibrugarh, and\u00a0Silchar. Air India and Indian Airlines along with several other private airlines operate daily services from\u00a0Delhi,\u00a0Kolkata,\u00a0Mumbai,\u00a0Bangalore, etc. Arriving by plane, however, gives a wonderful welcome aerial view of the green valley surrounded by blue hills in Assam. The major airlines operating in the region are: Kingfisher Airlines, Indian Airlines, Spicejet, Air Deccan\u00a0now known as Kingfisher Red and Indigo Airlines<br \/>\nFor the international travellers from\u00a0East Asia\u00a0or\u00a0South East Asia, the most easiest route to travel to Assam is via Kolkata. There are several direct flights from Kolkata to Guwahati, Dibrugarh, Silchar and Jorhat.<br \/>\n<strong>By rail. <\/strong>Assam is also well connected through Rail Services to Indian cities. Three major routes of North East Frontier Railways (NF Railways) covers entire Assam and provides linkages to principal zones and cities in north, east and south India. Guwahati railway station is the largest in Assam and is served by direct trains from most of the major cities in India. The Rajdhani Express (fully airconditioned) from\u00a0New Delhi\u00a0(takes 27 hours) and Saraighat Express from\u00a0Howrah\u00a0in\u00a0Kolkata\u00a0(takes 17 hours) are the fastest ones.<br \/>\n<strong>By car. <\/strong>There are highways from Indian states in the west and buses run between\u00a0Siliguri\u00a0(to Siliguri buses are available from\u00a0Kolkata,\u00a0Darjeeling\u00a0and\u00a0Gangtok) and\u00a0Guwahati; However, travelling by bus may not be comfortable in this patch and travel time is usually longer than that of trains. Road connectivity to surrounding Seven Sister States is good, however may take different durations depending on the location of the state.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GET AROUND<br \/>\n<\/strong>Assam and Seven Sisters region have densely built airports, which is attributed to the regions role as an important war front in Asia in WWII.<br \/>\n<strong>By bus and car.\u00a0<\/strong>Buses are the most common medium of travel in Assam. Buses in Assam are generally well maintained and comfortable. There are regular bus services connecting important places within Assam and to neighbouring states. Long distance buses generally are called Night Super Bus (because they usually travel only at after sunset) are more comfortable with reclining seats. Assam State Transport Corporation (ASTC) is state run bus company with a very exhaustive network. Some private players have large networks as well example &#8220;Network Travels&#8221;.<br \/>\nTaxi cabs can be a good option for travelling inside Assam and to the surrounding region. In majority cities and even small towns private taxi-cabs are available for rent for local travel as well for inter-city travel.<br \/>\n<strong>By train. <\/strong>Although having a fairly extensive railway network, trains are less convenient than buses or taxis for travelling short distances within Assam &#8211; inter-city or inter-regional trains are not very frequent within Assam. Moreover, the Assam&#8217;s rail network is fragmented due to different gauge size.<br \/>\n<strong>By plane.<br \/>\n<\/strong>Air travel from\u00a0Guwahati\u00a0to Upper Assam or Southern Assam districts can be quicker and easier. Guwahati is linked with\u00a0Dibrugarh,\u00a0Tezpur\u00a0and\u00a0Silchar\u00a0with several flights. However, it is important to book a ticket earlier. A flight between Guwahati and Dibrugarh takes roughly 45 minutes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>EAT<br \/>\n<\/strong>Ethnic Assamese cuisine is Rice with regional curries, including choices of fish, lambs, chickens and ducks. Assamese meals are usually accompanied by various side dishes like mash potatoes\u00a0(Alu Pitika)\u00a0or pickles of small fried fishes.<br \/>\n<strong>Drink<\/strong>. Tea: Assam is internationally famous for tea. It has a large tea growing industry. Most plantations are located in the upper Assam. 70% of tea is exported outside India. People drink tea with\/without milk and also sometimes containing ginger and spices such as cardamom.<br \/>\nWater: Problematic due to lack of sanitary facilities and sewage treatment in rural areas. It is therefore safe to drink bottled water or boiled water , or from aquaguard which are provided free at any hotel.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ASSAM (Guwahati, Jorhat, Tezpur)<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong><em>World Heritage Sites<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Kaziranga National Park<br \/>\nManas Wildlife Sanctuary<br \/>\n<strong><em>Tentative WHS<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Iconic Saree Weaving Clusters of India (15\/04\/2014)<br \/>\nMoidams \u2013 the Mound-Burial system of the Ahom Dynasty (15\/04\/2014)<br \/>\nRiver Island of Majuli in midstream of Brahmaputra River in Assam (02\/03\/2004)<br \/>\n<strong><em>Islands: <\/em><\/strong>Majuli<br \/>\n<strong><em>Borders<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Bangladesh-India<br \/>\nBhutan-India<br \/>\n<strong><em>Airports<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Jorhat (JRH)<br \/>\nSilchar (IXS)<br \/>\n<strong><em>Roads, Road Bridges and Tunnels: <\/em><\/strong>Dhola-Sadiya bridge<br \/>\n<strong><em>World of Nature<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Dibru-Saikhowa NP<br \/>\nKaziranga NP<br \/>\nManas NP<br \/>\nNameri NP<br \/>\nOrang NP<br \/>\nSonai Rupai Wildlife Sanctuary<br \/>\n<strong><em>Rivers<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Brahmaputra River<br \/>\nLohit\/Zay\u00fc River<br \/>\n<strong><em>Festivals: <\/em><\/strong>Bihu Festival, Assam<br \/>\n<strong><em>Waterfalls: <\/em><\/strong>Kaipholangso Waterfall (Kakochang)<br \/>\n<strong><em>Monuments: <\/em><\/strong>Jorhat: Lachit Borphukan Maidam<strong><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Cities of Asia and Oceania<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong><strong>GUWAHATI<br \/>\n<em>Airports: <\/em><\/strong>Guwahati (GAU)<br \/>\n<strong><em>Railway, Metro, Funiculars, Cable Cars: <\/em><\/strong>Kamrup Metropolitan: Guwahati Ropeway<br \/>\n<strong><em>Museums: <\/em><\/strong>Assam State Museum<br \/>\n<strong><em>Religious Temples:\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>Kamakhya Temple<br \/>\n<strong><em>Planetariums: <\/em><\/strong>Guwahati Planetarium<\/p>\n<p><strong>DIBRUGARH*<br \/>\n<em>Airports: <\/em><\/strong>Dibrugarh (DIB)<br \/>\n<strong><em>Railway, Metro, Funiculars, Cable Cars: <\/em><\/strong>Dibrugarh Rajdhani Express<br \/>\n<strong><em>Botanical Gardens: <\/em><\/strong>Jokai Botanical Garden<br \/>\n<strong><em>Roads, Road Bridges and Tunnels: <\/em><\/strong>Bogibeel Bridge<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Assam\u00a0is one of the seven\u00a0Northeastern\u00a0states, a land of blue hills, green valleys and a red river.
