HOT DATES<\/strong><br \/>\na. 12 large pitted Medjool dates, 4 oz Parmegiano-Reggiano cheese (can substitute local cheese like goat cheese) shaved, 6 slices bacon, cut in half.

SEA URCHIN<\/strong><br \/>\nIf tide right, dive for sea urchin (uni in Japan). It is an acquired taste.<br \/>\nINGREDIENTS<br \/>\n1 diving mask (wetsuit is optional, a hood helps)<br \/>\n1 sturdy knife to pry the urchins off<br \/>\n1 leather work glove to grab the urchin<br \/>\n1 urchin bed (in exposed rocky areas)<br \/>\n1 low tide (the lower the better)<br \/>\na bit of tamari soy sauce some wasabi (green horseradish paste)<br \/>\n<em>PREPARATION<\/em><br \/>\nSeal-land on the rocky shore, or have someone raft up with you while you jump overboard. (I prefer to keep my wetsuit dry, and wear it after diving-also, it&#8217;s easier to get down to the bottom without the wetsuit&#8217;s buoyancy.) As you descend, look carefully at your prey-you might as well get the biggest urchin you can on each dive! Try both the red and purple ones, to see which you prefer.<br \/>\nQuickly jam the knife underneath the urchin, before it can clamp on (if it clamps on, don&#8217;t fight it as you&#8217;ve already lost the contest-choose another). Twist the knife to pry the urchin off. It will float free (or begin tumbling downward, if found hand, gently. Try not to drop the knife. Swim back to the surface, and place the urchin in the prearrranged location-a sack held by your friend, in the front of your cockpit, or whatever. Avoid panicky movements-remind your friends that handling urchins is just like sleeping on a bed of nails- hold the urchin with both hands to distribute the pressure, and the spines will not penetrate. If they do, seek medical aid-they&#8217;re not fatal, but are mildly poisonous.<br \/>\nThe cold water tends to limit your harvest. One or two is enough for a group, unless you have any connoisseurs amongst you-then get 1 each for those people.<br \/>\nGo to a warm, sunny beach (a cold, drizzly beach will do in a pinch), and prepare to clean the urchins. Hold the knife&#8217;s tip against the urchin&#8217;s shell-wrap your fingers around the end of the handle, and hit that end with your other palm. Once the blade pierces the shell, one twist should neatly split the urchin in two.<br \/>\nInside you will find a ghastly mess of guts, membranes and partially digested seaweeds (these animals are grazers). Shake out all his loose material, and you will spy the cherished goal of this cold and macabre enterprise-the bright orange gonads of the urchin. Did I say gonads? Just tell your friends it&#8217;s the eggs, or they&#8217;ll begin to lose their appetite.<br \/>\nUse a spoon to scrape out the orange sections- five to an urchin, shaped like sections of a grapefruit. Carefully wash away the remaining bits of red membrane and green seaweed.<br \/>\nThis delicacy is best eaten raw. If you want to get fancy, squeeze a bit of wasabi onto each section, and sprinkle on a bit of soy sauce. A practical and visually appealing presentation is to serve each piece of uni on a blue mussel half-shell- open your mouth, tip the shell, and down the hatch!<br \/>\nA word of warning-the urchin eggs are an acquired taste. For first-time users, a small piece of one section is plenty. I found it fairly revolting my first time, but as I survived my first taste, curiousity got the better of me, and I tentatively nibbled at a bit more, then a bit more. The sweet, milky, seafoody taste grew on me, and now I am a full-on addict, known to endure near-hypothermia for a few sweet morsels!<br \/>\nFor the less adventurous, urchin eggs can be cooked, although I&#8217;ve never tried it. Just fry them up in butter and garlic.<\/p>\n<p><strong>7. CEVICHE IN CUCUMBER SHOT GLASSES<\/strong><br \/>\n2 fillets fish<br \/>\njuice of 10 key limes<br \/>\n2 tbsp fresh orange juice<br \/>\n\u00bc c diced red onion<br \/>\n1 tomato diced<br \/>\n\u00bd c jicama, grated<br \/>\n\u00bd c cilantro, finely chopped<br \/>\n1 serrano chili, finely chopped<br \/>\n4 cucumbers<br \/>\n1 tsp salt<br \/>\n1 tsp pepper<br \/>\nChop fish into tiny cubes. Combine lime and orange juices and red onion in bowl and marinate fish for 15 minutes. When the fish is \u2018cooked\u201d and the flesh turns white, mix in the chopped veggies. Cut the end off each cucumber and hollow out the insides. Can decorate outsides by slicing or peeling designs. Dice the insides of the cucumbers and add to the ceviche. Add the salt at the very end (stops the cooking process). Fill the \u201cshot glasses\u201d. Extra cucumber containers can be used with tequila, lime and salt as edible shot glasses.<\/p>\n<p><strong>8. OLIVE OL\u00c9.<\/strong><br \/>\nPitted green olives, chunks olive bread, thinly sliced chorizo, salad leaves.<\/p>\n<p><strong>9. ALMOND TAPAS<\/strong><br \/>\nToast a cup of whole almonds in frypan with a bit of olive oil. Dust with paprika.<\/p>\n<p><strong>10.

Dip 2\u201d of the tips of the bread sticks into the honey and drain. Wrap the ham around the sticks beginning at the tip, overlapping like a bandage.<\/p>\n<p><strong>11. TORTILLA ESPANOL<\/strong><br \/>\nChop 4 potatoes (red or gold skinned) into \u00bd \u201c cubes and 1 yellow onion. Heat olive oil and onion and potatoes until just tender. Whisk 6 eggs well.

Slice 1cm slices. Soak in marinade for at least 15 minutes before grilling. While eggplant grilling, slice 2 medium tomatoes in thin rounds, grate 1 cup mozzarella.<br \/>\nWhen the eggplant cooked and tender through, stack tomato and mozzarella on top, sprinkle chili powder, continue grilling till cheese melts. Remove, place basil leaf on top, cool and serve as appetizer. Can also be served with bread as a sandwich.<\/p>\n<p><strong>14.
