NOMANI AND HALA ARAFA, WASHINGTON POST | December 24, 2015<\/p>\n<p><strong>WHAT&#8217;S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A HIJAB, NIQAB, AND BURKA?<\/strong><br \/>\nHijab, niqab, burka &#8211; there are lots of different kinds of coverings worn by Muslim women all over the world.<br \/>\nSome wear a headscarf to cover their head and hair, while others wear a burka or niqab, which also covers up their face.<br \/>\nHeadscarves are seen as a sign of modesty, and a symbol of religious faith.<br \/>\nBut how can you tell which one is which? Check out our guide to the various different types.<br \/>\nThe word <strong>hijab<\/strong> describes the act of covering up generally but is often used to describe the headscarves worn by Muslim women. These scarves come in many styles and colours. The type most commonly worn in the West covers the head and neck but leaves the face clear.<br \/>\nThe <strong>niqab<\/strong> is a veil for the face that leaves the area around the eyes clear. However, it may be worn with a separate eye veil. It is worn with an accompanying headscarf.<br \/>\nThe <strong>burka<\/strong> is the most concealing of all Islamic veils. It is a one-piece veil that covers the face and body, often leaving just a mesh screen to see through.<br \/>\nThe <strong>al-amira<\/strong> is a two-piece veil. It consists of a close fitting cap, usually made from cotton or polyester, and a tube-like scarf.<br \/>\nThe <strong>shayla<\/strong> is a long, rectangular scarf popular in the Gulf region. It is wrapped around the head and tucked or pinned in place at the shoulders.<br \/>\nThe <strong>khimar<\/strong> is a long, cape-like veil that hangs down to just above the waist. It covers the hair, neck and shoulders completely, but leaves the face clear.<br \/>\nThe <strong>chador<\/strong>, worn by many Iranian women when outside the house, is a full-body cloak. It is often accompanied by a smaller headscarf underneath.<\/p>\n<p>Well-meaning non-Muslims are actually supporting the extreme Islamist argument that a woman\u2019s honour lies in her \u201cchastity\u201d.<br \/>\nLast week, three female religious leaders \u2014 a Jewish rabbi, an Episcopal vicar and a Unitarian reverend \u2014 and a male imam, or Muslim prayer leader, walked into the sacred space in front of the ornately-tiled minbar, or pulpit, at the Khadeeja Islamic Center in West Valley City, Utah. The women were smiling widely, their hair covered with swaths of bright scarves, to support \u201cWear a Hijab\u201d day.<\/p>\n<p>As Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Liberal leader Justin Trudeau trade question period barbs over the niqab, some Canadians might be scratching their heads.<br \/>\nHijab, niqab and burka are all common terms in Canadian media but they are also commonly confused. As Harper opposes a court decision to allow women to wear a niqab during a citizenship oath, and Trudeau says the prime minister is stoking the politics of fear, we explain the differences between the three commonly discussed garments.<br \/>\nAll are different styles of modest coverings for Muslim women who choose to wear them as an article of faith.<br \/>\nThe Salt Lake Tribune published a photo of fresh-faced teenage girls, who were not Muslim, in the audience at the mosque, their hair covered with long scarves. KSL TV later reported: \u201cThe hijab \u2014 or headscarf \u2014 is a symbol of modesty and dignity. When Muslim women wear headscarves, they are readily identified as followers of Islam.\u201d<br \/>\nFor us, as mainstream Muslim women, born in Egypt and India, the spectacle at the mosque was a painful reminder of the well-financed effort by conservative Muslims to dominate modern Muslim societies. This modern-day movement spreads an ideology of political Islam, called \u201cIslamism,\u201d enlisting well-intentioned interfaith do-gooders and the media into promoting the idea that \u201chijab\u201d is a virtual \u201csixth pillar\u201d of Islam, after the traditional \u201cfive pillars\u201d of the shahada (or proclamation of faith), prayer, fasting, charity and pilgrimage.<br \/>\nWe reject this interpretation that the \u201chijab\u201d is merely a symbol of modesty and dignity adopted by faithful female followers of Islam. This modern-day movement, codified by Iran, Saudi Arabia, Taliban Afghanistan and the Islamic State, has erroneously made the Arabic word hijab synonymous with \u201cheadscarf.\u201d This conflation of hijab with the secular word headscarf is misleading. \u201cHijab\u201d literally means \u201ccurtain\u201d in Arabic. It also means \u201chiding,\u201d \u201cobstructing\u201d and \u201cisolating\u201d someone or something. It is never used in the Koran to mean headscarf.<br \/>\nIn colloquial Arabic, the word for \u201cheadscarf\u201d is tarha. In classical Arabic, \u201chead\u201d is al-ra\u2019as and cover is gheta\u2019a. No matter what formula you use, \u201chijab\u201d never means headscarf. The media must stop spreading this misleading interpretation.<br \/>\nBorn in the 1960s into conservative but open-minded families (Hala in Egypt and Asra in India), we grew up without an edict that we had to cover our hair. But, starting in the 1980s, following the 1979 Iranian revolution of the minority Shiite sect and the rise of well-funded Saudi clerics from the majority Sunni sect, we have been bullied in an attempt to get us to cover our hair from men and boys. Women and girls, who are sometimes called \u201cenforce-hers\u201d and \u201cMuslim mean girls,\u201d take it a step further by even making fun of women whom they perceive as wearing the hijab inappropriately, referring to \u201chijabis\u201d in skinny jeans as \u201cho-jabis,\u201d using the short term for \u201cwhores.\u201d<br \/>\nBut in interpretations from the 7th century to today, theologians, from the late Moroccan scholar Fatima Mernissi to UCLA\u2019s Khaled Abou El Fadl, and Harvard\u2019s Leila Ahmed, Egypt\u2019s Zaki Badawi, Iraq\u2019s Abdullah al Judai and Pakistan\u2019s Javaid Ghamidi, have clearly established that Muslim women are not required to cover their hair.<\/p>\n<p>To us, the \u201chijab\u201d is a symbol of an interpretation of Islam we reject that believes that women are a sexual distraction to men, who are weak, and thus must not be tempted by the sight of our hair. We don\u2019t buy it. This ideology promotes a social attitude that absolves men of sexually harassing women and puts the onus on the victim to protect herself by covering up.<br \/>\nThe new Muslim Reform Movement, a global network of leaders, advocating for human rights, peace and secular governance, supports the right of Muslim women to wear \u2014 or not wear \u2014 the headscarf.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the idea of \u201chijab\u201d as a mandatory headscarf is promulgated by naive efforts such as \u201cWorld Hijab Day,\u201d started in 2013 by Nazma Khan, the Bangladeshi-American owner of a Brooklyn-based headscarf company, and Ahlul Bayt, a Shiite-proselytizing TV station, that the University of Calgary promotes as a resource for its participation in \u201cWorld Hijab Day.\u201d The TV station argues that wearing a \u201chijab\u201d is necessary for women to avoid \u201cunwanted attention.\u201d World Hijab Day, Ahlul Bayt and the University of Calgary didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.<br \/>\nIn its \u201cresources,\u201d Ahluly Bayt includes a link to the notion that \u201cthe woman is awrah,\u201d or forbidden, an idea that leads to the confinement, subordination, silencing and subjugation of women\u2019s voices and presence in public society. It also includes an article, \u201cThe top 10 excuses of Muslim women who don\u2019t wear hijab and their obvious weaknesses,\u201d with the argument, \u201cGet on the train of repentance, my sister, before it passes by your station.\u201d<br \/>\nThe rush to cover women\u2019s hair has reached a fever pitch with ultraconservative Muslim websites and organizations pushing this interpretation, such as VirtualMosque.com and Al-Islam.org, which even published a feature, \u201cHijab Jokes,\u201d mocking Muslim women who don\u2019t cover their hair \u201cIslamically.\u201d<br \/>\nLast week, high school girls at Vernon Hills High School, outside Chicago, wore headscarves for an activity, \u201cWalk a Mile in Her Hijab,\u201d sponsored by the school\u2019s conservative Muslim Students Association. It disturbed us to see the image of the girls in scarves.<br \/>\nFurthermore, Muslim special-interest groups are feeding articles about \u201cMuslim women in hijab\u201d under siege. Staff members at the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which has pressed legal and PR complaints against U.S. companies that have barred employees from wearing hijabs on the job, has even called their organization \u201cthe hijab legal defence fund.\u201d<br \/>\nToday, in the 21st century, most mosques around the world, including in the United States, deny us, as Muslim women, our Islamic right to pray without a headscarf, discriminating against us by refusing us entry if we don\u2019t cover our hair. Like the Catholic Church after the Vatican II reforms of 1965 removed a requirement that women enter churches with heads covered, mosques should become headscarf-optional, if they truly want to make their places of worship \u201cwomen-friendly.\u201d<br \/>\nFortunately, we have those courageous enough to challenge these edicts. In early May 2014, an Iranian journalist, Masih Alinejad, started a brave new campaign, #MyStealthyFreedom, to protest laws requiring women to wear hijabs that Iran\u2019s theocracy put in place after it won control in 1979. The campaign\u2019s slogan: \u201cThe right for individual Iranian women to choose whether they want hijab.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>The mandate that women cover their hair relies on misinterpretations of Koranic verses.<\/strong><br \/>\nIn Arabic dictionaries, hijab refers to a \u201cbarrier,\u201d not necessarily between men and women, but also between two men. Hijab appears in a Koranic verse (33:53), during the fifth year of the prophet Muhammad\u2019s migration, or hijra, to Medina, when some wedding guests overstayed their welcome at the prophet\u2019s home. It established some rules of etiquette for speaking to the wives of prophet Muhammad: \u201cAnd when ye ask of them anything, ask it of them from behind a hijab. This is purer for your hearts and for their hearts.\u201d Thus, hijab meant a partition.<br \/>\nThe word hijab, or a derivative, appears only eight times in the Koran as an \u201cobstacle\u201d or \u201cwall of separation\u201d (7:46), a \u201ccurtain\u201d (33:53), \u201chidden\u201d (38:32), just a \u201cwall of separation\u201d (41:5, 42:52, 17:45), \u201chiding\u201d (19:14) and \u201cprevented\u201d or \u201cdenied access to God\u201d (83:15).<br \/>\nIn the Koran, the word hijab never connotes any act of piety. Rather, it carries the negative connotation of being an actual or metaphorical obstacle separating the \u201cnon-believers\u201d in a dark place, noting \u201cour hearts are under hijab (41:5),\u201d for example, a wall of separation between those in heaven and those in hell (7:46) or \u201cSurely, they will be mahjaboon from seeing their Lord that day (83:15).\u201d Mahjaboon is a derivate verb from hijab. The Saudi Koran translates it as \u201cveiled.\u201d Actually, in this usage, it means, \u201cdenied access.\u201d<br \/>\nThe government of Saudi Arabia twists its translation of the verse to impose face veils on women, allowing them even to see with just \u201cone eye\u201d<br \/>\nThe most cited verse to defend the headscarf (33:59) states, \u201cOh, Prophet tell thy wives and thy daughters and the believer women to draw their jilbab close around them; this will be better so that they be recognized and not harmed and God is the most forgiving, most merciful.\u201d According to Arabic dictionaries, jilbab means \u201clong, overflowing gown\u201d which was the traditional dress at the time. The verse does not instruct them to add a new garment but rather adjust an existing one. It also does not mean headscarf.<br \/>\nDisturbingly, the government of Saudi Arabia twists its translation of the verse to impose face veils on women, allowing them even to see with just \u201cone eye.\u201d The government\u2019s translation reads: \u201cO Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed, and God is most forgiving, most merciful.\u201d<br \/>\nLooked at in context, Islamic historians say this verse was revealed in the city of Medina, where the prophet Muhammad fled to escape persecution in Mecca, and was revealed to protect women from rampant sexual aggression they faced on the streets of Medina, where men often sexually harassed women, particularly slaves. Today, we have criminal codes that make such crimes illegal; countries that don\u2019t have such laws need to pass them, rather than punishing women for the violent acts of others.<br \/>\nAnother verse (24:31) is also widely used to justify a headscarf, stating, \u201c\u2026 and tell the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their chastity, and do not reveal their adornment except what is already shown; and draw their khemar over their neck\u2026.\u201d<br \/>\nIn old Arabic poetry, the khemar was a fancy silk scarf worn by affluent women. It was fixed on the middle of the head and thrown over their back, as a means of seducing men and flaunting their wealth. This verse was revealed at a time, too, when women faced harassment when they used open-air toilets. The verse also instructs how to wear an existing traditional garment. It doesn\u2019t impose a new one.<\/p>\n<p>In 1919, Egyptian women marched on the streets demanding the right to vote; they took off their veils, imported as a cultural tradition from the Ottoman Empire, not a religious edict. The veil then became a relic of the past.<br \/>\nLater, Egyptian President Gamal Abdel-Nasser said in a speech in the early 1960s that, when he sought reconciliation with members of the Muslim Brotherhood group for attempting to assassinate him in 1954, the Supreme Leader of the Brotherhood gave him a list of demands, including, \u201cimposing hijab on Egyptian women.\u201d The audience members didn\u2019t understand what the word hijab meant. When Nasser explained that the Brotherhood wanted Egyptian women to wear a headscarf, the audience members burst out laughing.<br \/>\nAs women who grew up in modern Muslim families with theologians, we are trying to reclaim our religion from the prongs of a strict interpretation. Like in our youth, we are witnessing attempts to make this strict ideology the one and only accepted face of Islam. We have seen what the resurgence of political Islam has done to our regions of origin and to our adoptive country.<br \/>\nAs Americans, we believe in freedom of religion. But we need to clarify to those in universities, the media and discussion forums that in exploring the \u201chijab,\u201d they are not exploring Islam, but rather the ideology of political Islam as practiced by the mullahs, or clerics, of Iran and Saudi Arabia, the Taliban in Afghanistan and the Islamic State.<br \/>\nIn the name of \u201cinterfaith,\u201d these well-intentioned Americans are getting duped by the agenda of Muslims who argue that a woman\u2019s honour lies in her \u201cchastity\u201d and unwittingly pushing a platform to put a hijab on every woman.<br \/>\nPlease do this instead: do not wear a headscarf in \u201csolidarity\u201d with the ideology that most silences us, equating our bodies with \u201chonour.\u201d Stand with us instead with moral courage against the ideology of Islamism that demands we cover our hair.<\/p>\n<p>Washington Post<br \/>\nAsra Q.
