It dominates the terrain between the Norns Range to the south and the Valhallas to the north. Access is challenging as forestry roads to the north, east and south are either overgrown or deactivated. This leaves only Grizzly FSR on the west in passable condition, a lot of bushwhacking to get to the west ridge and a long day. Climbed only about once per year, usually a KMC trip.

Cross the creek to the north side. As of 2016, large boulders blocked this bridge and only ATVs and motorcycles could get around the block. 2kms further, the road was washed out. Bush has made most of the road impassible, certainly for vehicles after 4kms. ATVs can go to the road end. \u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">11.6km Switchback, turn left.

Continue along the road (do not take a more direct route toward the peak, and don\u2019t bushwhack up the cliff). Shortly before the road\u2019s end, head uphill to the right, aiming for the obvious notch in the top of the clearcut. A snowmobile path cut illegally by an excavator in about 2000 goes straight up to the snowmobilers cabin. It begins just behind a dead tree that is snapped off, at the top of the clearcut, on high ground to the right of the notch. If you come to a creek while still in the clear-cut you are too far left, but can follow the creek upstream until you cross the trail higher up in the forest. The trail rapidly goes through the forest along the creek, flattening out as it crosses an interesting boulder field. The cabin is in a meadow just below the tree line. Climb through the open bush to the northeast ridge (above the cabin), don&#8217;t go too high, and bypass a false summit on its left. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Though this is longer, this route involves little bushwhacking.
