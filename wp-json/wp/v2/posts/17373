A prehistoric site near Lake Turkana, the lower valley of the Omo is renowned the world over. The discovery of many fossils there, especially\u00a0<em>Homo gracilis<\/em>, has been of fundamental importance in the study of human evolution.<br \/>\nIt extends over an area of 165 km<sup>2<\/sup>.<br \/>\nThe Lower Omo Valley includes the Konso and Fejej paleontological research locations with sedimentary deposits going back to the polio-Pleistocene period. These have produced numerous hominid and animal fossils, including fragments of Australopithecus. The deposits of human vertebrae fauna, and paleo-environmental evolution, shed light on the earliest stages of the origins and development of Homo sapiens of Africa. The discoveries of ancient stone tools in an encampment also offer evidence of the oldest known technical activities of prehistoric beings spanning between one and 3.5 million years.<\/p>\n<p>All ethnic groups in the region are being exploited by tourism. They have become tourist attractions. Some traditions are fascinating but once they&#8217;ve reached a certain level of popularity, they tend to be performed.\u00a0 Like a human zoo &#8211; over-commercialized, over-priced, and the entire region ruled by an unregulated tourism mafia. Especially with the all-inclusive packages from Addis \u2013 900 US$ for a 5-day tour. The drivers only want to take you to the touristy towns. Market Days in the Omo Valley are held weekly in each town.<br \/>\nThings are organized for tourists because they want to see it and pay. You are a white person who brings money and other presents. It is often recommended to not go there. Pay hundreds for unnecessary guides that will walk you through the market making the experience worse.<br \/>\nYou can get a better experience by spending more time, trying to become a part of the community a little better and asking around. There are many small villages that you don&#8217;t pay, untouched and no crowds. Many may not be open to tourists. It is often the unscheduled places that are best. Meet locals through couchsurfing.<br \/>\n<strong>Jinka. <\/strong>Local tour operators are unregulated, unprofessional, rude, and mafia-like. Recommended to completely skip any contact with them. One may end up paying more for them than a regular tour from Addis who take care of their reputation. Jinka can be pleasant and authentic.<br \/>\nSaturday Market.<br \/>\nHostel Mekuria on Hostelworld.<br \/>\n<strong>Mursi.<\/strong> Lip plates are the major draw and these are the tribe that account for the entire reputation of the valley. The custom of wearing a lip plate is\u00a0linked to the female&#8217;s fertility and eligibility for marriage. When a Mursi girl reaches puberty (around age 15 to 16) she will have her lip cut by a female member of the tribe and a small wooden stick is inserted. \u00a0the larger the clay plate, the more the woman is worth before she gets married.<br \/>\nA girl\u2019s lower lip is cut (sometimes by her mother) when she reaches 15 or 16, and held open by a sodden plug until it heals. It\u2019s up to the girls how far they want the lip to be stretched. The very painful process often takes over several months. Lip plates are more <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">frequently worn by unmarried girls and newlywed women than by older married women with children. They are generally worn on occasions such as serving men food, milking cows, and important rituals like weddings.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Unmarried girls, especially those with large labrets, might wear them whenever they are in public. The lip plate carries a number of meanings. Firstly, it\u2019s a symbol of great beauty. Secondly, it marks a commitment to the husband because it is worn with great pride when serving him food. If the husband dies, the lip plate is removed since a woman\u2019s external beauty is said to fade after his death. Lastly, the plate is a powerful visual marker of Mursi identity. Without it, they run the risk of being mistaken for a member of another tribe. Although very unique and part of their tradition, the Mursi women only wear the plates for a short time because they are so heavy and uncomfortable.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span class=\"ILfuVd\" lang=\"en\"><span class=\"hgKElc\">It affects the speech of women since it alters the articulators needed for speech production: the lower lip and the lower incisors. Due to the effect of this practice, women cannot produce bilabial and dental consonants in their language.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/span>Pay a national park fee, a tribal guide and for each photo. Many tourists feel like visiting is a complete scam, expensive, short visits, and unpleasant. Can be confusing about what is real and what was fake. Need to get off the beaten path to find genuine experiences. Tourism is still in a very awkward place in Omo valley, but the authentic is still there just beyond the tourist mafia system.

The Jinka airport is as spartan as it gets &#8211; the only bathroom is a dilapidated metal sheet shed 100m from the minimal airport. I was immediately met by a &#8220;tour guide&#8221; who offered to drive me to Turmi to see the Hamer people and then drive to Konso for $350. I told him he was a tourist mafia.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>I got a tuk-tuk into Jinka to the bus depot for 200 birr. A share van was leaving for Konso at 6 pm for 500 birr so I rather reluctantly (after two previous long bus rides, I was more than jaded) jumped on the bus to leave at noon for 200 birr. It was about 200 km for the same price as 4 km. <\/em><em><br \/>\nIt was noon before it left but I lucked out with a good seat &#8211; a front bench seat with lots of leg room and a big padded bolster that is over the engine that I could completely stretch out my legs. As always I am the only white person on these public buses, 40 or so bad seats, usually packed full. After loading several huge sacks and getting gas, we finally left Jinka at 12:30 on a fair road with only a few large. pot holes. The major impediment was all the horned Brahma cattle who wondered down the middle of the road impervious to us. Plus some goats.<br \/>\nAfter an hour we reached Key Afar, one of the good market towns. Outside we were stopped by a road barricade, everyone got off and walked to the other side while the police did a cursory inspection of the contents. The little kids looked at me as if they had never seen a while guy.<br \/>\nThe landscape is a hilled, dry, treed country surrounded by low forested mountains. We went over four low passes and then crossed broad flat valleys with arrow-straight highway.<br \/>\nTwo-thirds of the way to Konso, at Woto, we pick up many passengers &#8211; it is standing room only and six guys are sitting on the bolster, including one guy in between my knees. We stopped in the middle of nowhere and loaded 20 bundles of thin firewood and two giant sacks of charcoal.<br \/>\nAs we approach Konso, the hilly country is completely terraced. The drive took about 4 hours.<br \/>\nKonso is a gritty little town high up on the side of a mountain. There were four hotels in town. but only one that seemed reputable.<br \/>\n<\/em><strong><br \/>\nKonso Cultural Landscape<\/strong>. WHS is an arid property of stone-walled terraces and fortified settlements in the Konso highlands of Ethiopia. It constitutes a spectacular example of a living cultural tradition stretching back 21 generations (more than 400 years) adapted to its dry hostile environment. The site also features anthropomorphic wooden statues &#8211; grouped to represent respected members of their communities and particularly heroic events &#8211; which are an exceptional living testimony to funerary traditions that are on the verge of disappearing. Stone steles in the towns express a complex system of marking the passing of generations of leaders.<br \/>\n<em>ON Konso Edget Hotel 2. A small room with a single bed and tiny bathroom, but was clean. 250 birr. It has a huge busy bar with many outside tables. The guy in the nest room snored so loud that he kept me awake.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 14<\/strong> Wed Dec 4<em><br \/>\nI was up early and down at the bus station at 05:30 to get the long bus to Addis Ababa 1000 birr. 532 km.<br \/>\nWe were stopped at a police checkpoint just outside of Konso. They were jerks and threw a bunch of luggage (in plastic bags) off the bus. As were stopped, a minivan with 100s of live chickens on the roof rack stopped near us. We had many passengers with live chickens (they carry them upside down by the legs) &#8211; this is the classic food at this big Ethiopian festive season.<br \/>\nA village we passed was crowded with people, donkeys drawing carts with car tires and drivers standing, goats and a lot of cattle (skinny, all their ribs show).<br \/>\nArba Minch. It took 2&#8217;20&#8221; to drive the 88 km here. It is an attractive city with good roads, lovely roundabouts, no garbage and a lot of new construction.<br \/>\nWe finally stopped past Bhodit for lunch with 20 minutes to eat. All they said they had was vegetables and I got a large portion of soggy spinach and a very small portion of good saut\u00e9d vegetables with some day-old hard bread. I sent the spinach back and got more vegetables with some spaghetti &#8211; all good, but now had only 5 minutes to eat it. 60 birr. Virtually the entire bus emptied in Bhodit and I slept across the 5 seats.<br \/>\nWe stopped several times to gather branches for the goat riding on the roof.<br \/>\nPassing through the treed country with yellow savannah, the route taken did not go to the east side of the Rift Valley and Adama but continued straight to Addis. Fortunately, Tiya, a WHS was on the route. My plan if we didn&#8217;t go this way was to go to Addis and spend January 5th coming down the 100 km to Tiya. This was going to save me almost a full day.<br \/>\nI had almost no birr left so walked 600 m down to the NOC Bank, in a filling station. The ATM didn&#8217;t work because it wasn&#8217;t connected to electricity but the branch was open. I think I gave them their most interesting transaction for a while when I wanted to exchange 20\u20ac for birr (1800 black market, 1140 official). They brought out a bill counting machine to check if the bill was counterfeit but it only worked for US$. I showed them how to use the watermark on all bills to ascertain if it was real. I got 1123.2 birr for the twenty.<br \/>\nI tried to buy milk and kept getting pointed down the block but after 6 small shops, I realized there was none in Tiya. For dinner, I eventually had two deep-fried pastries with spiced meat and 2 coffees for 60 birr ($1.20) so it was a pretty cheap place to eat. Another place had ingura but I have gotten tired of that (Ethiopians eat if for BF, lunch and dinner).<br \/>\n<\/em>ON I&#8217;m not sure of the name of the hotel but it appeared to be the only one in Tiya. The room was very basic and of questionable cleanliness but had a bed and 2 chairs. The bathroom was gross with no running water, a toilet that had not been flushed for some time and garbage lining the shower walls. The one electrical plug didn&#8217;t work &#8211; a power bank is a necessity for travelling in these countries for situations like this. 200 birr (~$4).<br \/>\nWith nothing to do here except drink beer, I was in bed at 20:00 to read and finish this post. It was very cool and I killed several mosquitos (who weren&#8217;t biting) as they flew across my computer screen.<br \/>\nA donkey tied up in the yard brayed all night.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 14<\/strong> Thur Jan 5<br \/>\nI bought some pens (they keep falling through a hole in my pocket) and breakfast of coffee and deep-fried doughnuts and then walked about 1\/2 km to the Tiya WHS.<br \/>\n<strong>Tiya.<\/strong> Tiya is among the most important of the roughly 160 archaeological sites discovered so far in the Soddo region, south of Addis Ababa. The site contains 41 monuments in three areas &#8211; 33, 4 and 4 stelae, all carved stelae covered with symbols &#8211; swords (indicates warriors killed), breasts, bananas and head rests. 52 graves were excavated, 51 of them in a sitting position. The graves sit behind the stelae. One pre-Christian symbol was a stone phallus. Three flat stones had a shield, a good representation of a queen with head, hanging breast, arms and skirt and a drum. They are the remains of an ancient Ethiopian culture whose age is thought to be from the 7th to 14th centuries. 310 birr.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"colorbox init-colorbox-processed cboxElement\" title=\"Tiya Stones, Intricately Carved Monoliths of Ethiopia\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ancient-origins.net\/sites\/default\/files\/field\/image\/Tiya-Stones-monoliths-Ethiopia.jpg\" data-colorbox-gallery=\"gallery-node-2564-UW9uQN4XXEo\" data-cbox-img-attrs=\"{&quot;title&quot;: &quot;&quot;, &quot;alt&quot;: &quot;Tiya Stones, Intricately Carved Monoliths of Ethiopia&quot;}\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" title=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ancient-origins.net\/sites\/default\/files\/field\/image\/Tiya-Stones-monoliths-Ethiopia.jpg\" alt=\"Tiya Stones, Intricately Carved Monoliths of Ethiopia\" width=\"621\" height=\"414\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.ancient-origins.net\/sites\/default\/files\/field\/image\/Tiya-Stones-monoliths-Ethiopia.jpg\" data-done=\"Loaded\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em>I then caught a share van to Addis at 10 am getting a great front seat. 200 birr. They loaded a &#8220;pen&#8221; made of branches, chicken wire and a large nylon bag full of live chickens. One never sees chickens for sale at any restaurants and it appears they are saved for Christmas being held this week. Chickens are everywhere and several people on the buses and vans have one or two.<br \/>\nThe drive is through a lovely open savannah, all yellow stubble and stacks of straw from the harvested wheat crops and spotted with trees. We pass a huge herd of camels, incongruously out of place as this is hardly desert, although most of the trees appear to be acacia. I feel sorry for the donkeys (and some horses), seemingly small for most donkeys, they are the beast of burden hauling huge loads on carts with big car wheels.<br \/>\nAfter driving all over to deliver the chickens, I arrived 12 km from the airport at 12:30, took share vans in the general direction for 5km and finally got a taxi. He took me to the common black market money exchange and I got 80 birr\/\u20ac (instead of the official 56.5).
