This trail goes through a protected Blue Heron bird sanctuary known as the Waldie Island Heron Reserve. No bikes are allowed on this trail and dog-owners are requested to prevent dogs from disturbing birds by keeping them on leash or close by. This is particularly important for Blue Heron population recovery in this area.<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Difficulty:<\/strong> Easy A1<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> <strong>Elevation gained:<\/strong> 0m<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> <strong>Distance:<\/strong> 1.5km<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Drive:<\/strong> <u>West Access<\/u>: Drive north across the bridge connecting Castlegar and Robson.

The Waldie Island Trail runs through a wildlife reserve and because of ecological sensitivity, is meant for pedestrian traffic only. Signs explain aspects of local history and wetland ecology. The island itself is owned by the Nature Trust of BC and is protected as a heron reserve; no access is allowed to the island. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> With the operation of the Keenlyside and Brilliant Dams, water levels can change rapidly (over an hour or two).
