It is located in the coastal Djibouti Region on the Gulf of Tadjoura.<br \/>\nThe settlement was founded in 1888 by the French. Known as the <em>Pearl of the Gulf of Tadjoura<\/em> due to its location, Djibouti is strategically positioned near the world&#8217;s busiest shipping lanes and acts as a refuelling and transshipment center. The Port of Djibouti is the principal maritime port for imports to and exports from neighbouring Ethiopia. Djibouti-Ambouli International Airport is the main domestic airport, connecting the capital to various major global destinations. Djibouti has the second-largest economy of any city in the Horn of Africa after Addis Ababa.<br \/>\n<strong>History<\/strong>: Ras Djibouti is a highly strategic location, a future bridgehead for French designs in the rest of Africa and Asia. It is then that this point begins to be used as a departure for caravans toward Harar. Founded in 1888, its main purpose was to protect French trade routes to Madagascar and Indochina. Many Issa and Afar nomads left their herds to settle here, and built houses on what is now the downtown area. The French and natives built hotels, houses, mosques and churches. The Yemeni, Egyptian, Greek, Armenian and Italian merchants and traders. Its main activity remains the supply of French ships en route to Indochina or Madagascar. Only 150,000 tonnes of freight per year are handled.<br \/>\nDjibouti became the center of exports from southern Ethiopia and the\u00a0Ogaden, including trade in\u00a0Harari coffee\u00a0and\u00a0khat. When\u00a0Djibouti\u00a0declared\u00a0Independence on 27 June 1977, the population of Djibouti was over 110,000.<br \/>\n<strong>Climate <\/strong>is\u00a0arid with very hot rainless summers and a very warm, slightly wetter winter season.<br \/>\n<strong>Demographics.<\/strong> Djibouti is a multi-ethnic town.

We were immediately at odds with each other. I could only describe him as a &#8220;slippery&#8221; character &#8211; hard to get clear answers or understand my issues. I finally called him a bullshitter and he got quite angry with me. Daniel explained that going from Arte beach was not recommended as the boat operators were not reliable, you could have engine problems or weather issues and they would be unable to help much. It was much safer to go from the pier to get a boat. <\/em><br \/>\n<em>I phoned Daniel and agreed to a two-day\/one-night trip to Lake Abbe and Lake Assal for $600. It took me a while to get my head around the price but a 4WD cast was almost $395 to rent for one day, Daniel explained that if I got stuck, it would cost $500 to get you out. The price was all-inclusive.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>Daniel arrived at the hotel promptly at 09:30, we discussed the trip and left stopping for drinks, food and cigarettes.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>He is a smart straightforward guy and explained a lot of Horn of Africa politics. He is very knowledgeable and we got along right away. The vehicle is a Land Cruiser and both he and a driver were present.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>We stopped for lunch but had Ethiopian coffee. As most of the vehicles are Ethiopian truckers, birr is the common currency. We passed the road to Dire Dawa with the Ethiopian border only 20 km away (it parallels the border for the entire distance). This is a major route to Ethiopia and there were many big trucks.<\/em><em><br \/>\n35 km from Abbe, we stop at a village.to buy quat as a gift to the people at the lake and where the main&#8221;production&#8221; is children. There are children everywhere. They used to marry at age 12 for girls and 14 for boys. Electricity and education arrived about 3 years ago and now it is 14 and 16. None of the children are begging which is nice. French soldiers give candy and money which is a bad habit. All the homes are plaster-covered mud bricks.<br \/>\nMarrying cousins is common. In Arab culture, a boy would marry the cousin of an uncle but in the Afar culture, it would be the child of an aunt so as not to dilute power.<br \/>\nThe road braids all over the place as we drive down a very wide wadi and it is easy to take the wrong one. There is a range of low hills on both sides &#8211; the one to follow is towards the end of the one on the right side. Possibly the main reason to have a guide is for route finding &#8211; there are no signs, markers or obvious routes and following a mapping program often leads one in the wrong direction. 4WD is only used in one 15 m section as you cross the hills near the lake when the road goes up a steep, rocky section. Only high clearance is necessary. We got out here and climbed a low rise to get a view of the lake and the chimneys. My long experience driving 4WD in Canada and the US would have been more than adequate. The other significant issue is to not leave the established tracks as you approach the lake. It may appear solid but the high water table produces soft areas where even a 4&#215;4 will get stuck. That is what can cost $500 for the locals to dig you out.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>20 km away we pass through the last village. There is a nice school and community centre but the houses consist of sticks, are flat-roofed and not covered with tarps. We passed four people walking from here to the lake.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Lac Abbeh:<\/strong> <strong>son paysage culturel, ses monuments naturels et son \u00e9cosyst\u00e8me<\/strong> (05\/01\/2015). Of tectonic origin, it is an endorheic salt lake in East Africa straddling the border with Ethiopia. 60% of the lake is in Ethiopia.<br \/>\n8500 years ago, Lake Abbeh occupied most of the Gobaad depression with an area of \u200b\u200b6000km\u00b2. The infiltration of water rich in gypsum (calcium sulphate) meeting at high temperatures with the sodium carbonate waters of Lake Abbeh caused an over-saturation resulting in sulphurous steam chimneys or fumaroles that led to its drying out. Construction of dams in Ethiopia has accelerated the aridity. A combination of cyanobacteria and algae is crucial in fixing the calcium. There are hundreds of chimneys of all sizes weirdly eroded into all sorts of shapes. When the locals dig down, hot springs are formed which they drain away with ditches. We saw four hot springs. Natural springs also produce verdant areas of grass. One was fenced with poles for pasturing their goats.<br \/>\nThe archaeological site of Asa Koma is about thirty kilometres from Lake Abbeh and dates to the second millennium BC. It includes graves, furniture: decorated ceramics, bone tools, and net weights. The economy was based on fishing, hunting (especially jackal), and cattle breeding.<br \/>\nThe archaeological site of Barogali is 30 km from Lake Abbeh. Fossilized remains of large mammals include the elephant, one of the few known butchering sites in the Oldowan and Early Acheulean period of East Africa.<br \/>\nAbbeh Lake is a relatively shallow salt lake 8.6 meters deep. Spectacular drying since the 1950s has caused it size to reduce from 552 km2 in 1939, to 396 km2 in 1955, and to 180 km2 in 1989 &#8211; more than 67% in 60 years. Lake Abbeh receives water from the Awash River. It has no outlet except evaporation. It is connected to five other lakes which are Lake Afambo, Lake Bario, Lake Gargori, Lake Gummare and Lake Laitali. On the eastern side of Lake Abbeh, there are several small freshwater hot springs. These springs were once at the bottom of the lake and created chimneys (or fumaroles) of crystallized minerals that are now exposed in the open air and thirty and fifty meters in height. they consist of diatoms, bacteria and calcium carbonate, all easily visible on the surface of the chimneys.<br \/>\nThere is little vegetation with trees only along the wadis. About twenty thousand species of birds are listed: the greater flamingo and the lesser flamingo, lesser spurred lapwings and plover, and migrating waders such as the wagtail and the little sandpiper. Freshwater fish are in the lake and Pelzeln&#8217;s gazelles <em>are <\/em>around the lake. We saw two groups of warthogs with five animals. One had enormous tusks. We were able to take photos fairly close as they grazed on an area of green grass fed from springs.<br \/>\n<em><br \/>\nWe arrived at the lake camp &#8211; two large buildings (one with a solar-powered freezer to put your drinks in) and several &#8220;sleeping huts&#8221;. Some are stonewalled with a tent-like roof and fans and some are mat-covered domes. Each has two cots with mattresses.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>I slept on a cot outside and would encourage all to do the same to experience it. After dinner, Daniel and walked out to the chimneys for sunset. Eleven local Afar men put on a very nice dance\/singing show. They sang about 4 songs and we participated.<\/em><em><br \/>\nON Lake Abbe camp. The spectacular &#8220;dark sky&#8221; was less because of a 3\/4 moon. There were no mosquitoes and a nice breeze, a much cooler place to sleep than in the provided accommodation. The wind stopped at about 4 and the mosquitoes arrived but with some Deet, all was fine.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 3<\/strong> Thur Jan 12<em><br \/>\nAt 05:30, we were driven back out to the chimneys, visited another hot spring (all man-made) and walked for about an hour, eventually returning for breakfast. At 09:00 we left returning the way we came until the turn off for Lake Assal.<br \/>\nFirst, we are up at 05:30 to walk out to the chimneys for sunrise. There are no clouds and the sunrise was spectacular.<br \/>\nAfter breakfast, we drove to Mount Michele, the largest chimney, 60m high and 90m in diameter and parked at a nearby chimney. It has a steaming hot water spring with a fumeral at its very top. Daniel does his usual blowing on the surface and waving a lit cigarette over the surface, both of which cause significant steam it be generated &#8211; magic (probably caused by cooler air).<br \/>\nAt the first village, there is a noise from the left rear wheel. The bottom leaf of the spring has unusually twisted out laterally. The driver tries to pound it back in but part of the frame prevents it. We are soon surrounded by 15 little kids, all barefoot and some with snotty noses and pussy eyes who hold out their hands for bonbons. We are unsuccessful and drive on hoping to see a mechanic in the next town. They can pound the spring back and try to find a way to prevent it from happening again.<br \/>\nWe continued onto the town we had coffee on day 2. Two truckers from Ethiopia invited me to share a lunch of beans, salad and bread. Daniel also bought a salad with tuna and bread plus spaghetti. It was all delicious.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Aire naturelle prot\u00e9g\u00e9e de Djal\u00e9lo<\/strong> (05\/01\/2015). In the Arta region, 40 km from the capital. 45 km\u00b2.

Lake Assal is an endorheic salt lake in the Afar depression, at an altitude of 153 meters below sea level (the lowest point on the African continent and the third-lowest point on Earth after the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea). It was formed by the opening of the Great Rift Valley. The area consists of a dry part, a white plain dry lake bed, and a highly saline water body. The main source of water supply is subsurface geothermal springs with aquifers linked to seawater. Specialized algae and fish live in the lake.<br \/>\nThe lake water has 351 gm of salt per litre (normal sea water is 22 gm\/l). There is a Chinese factory at the south end discharging chemicals directly into the lake changing the colour of the water and producing a long line of white scum that covers the east end of the lake. The plant hires no Djibouti workers, all are Chinese.<br \/>\nAt the north end, the water ends at a white salt flat that is 80 m thick. Anything left on the salt (animal skulls, wood sticks, rebar is completely encrusted with white salt in a week.<br \/>\nIt is only nice to visit for 10-15 min and not much to do after walking on the salt lake, and taking some photos, it is very hot, and there are no facilities. The pollution makes one hesitant to swim or float in the lake after seeing the solvent bubbles and realizing the chemical smell.<em><br \/>\n<\/em><strong><br \/>\nHamoudi Mosque.<\/strong> The only NM site in Djibouti City, it is downtown nowhere near where Google Maps places it.

It is less than 3 km long and is surrounded by the smaller Maskali Islands, a few islets and a coral reef. Has an arid climate very warm in December, January and February, to extremely hot in July. The economy is mainly tourism and one of the popular holiday destinations in Djibouti. Snorkelling with whale sharks is not as good as at Arta Beach. The season is November to early February and one of the best in the world. Musha is the main city on the island.<br \/>\nHistory: In 1840, it was sold to Great Britain for ten sacks of rice. In 1887, Britain ceded it to France recognizing the French sphere of influence in the Gulf of Tadjoura, in exchange for the abandonment by France of any right in Zeila and the neighbouring Sa&#8217;ad ad-Din Islands.<br \/>\nMoucha Island is very expensive to charter a boat, if not in a sizeable group. Travel companies usually do not have boats going with other people Djibouti is a small place and there are only a handful of operators. Diving is not well established, only 1-2 companies do it and only if they have a big group.<br \/>\n<em>Daniel was able to arrange for me to join a group of French expats going for the day. There were three boats of about 12-14 each &#8211; army, families and other French who left at 09:30, taking about 30 minutes. $60. By arrival, I was completely soaked but I was sitting on the front right. Forget your electronics but do bring what you want to drink as a small Heineken was $6.50 and a small pop $3.25 (all the others had large coolers of beer). We went to a resort on the east end &#8211; several condo-style buildings, a large covered area of picnic tables and palapas with loungers to sunbathe. It is a lovely beach &#8211; 1 km long of white, hard-packed sand backed by low dunes. I walked toward the end but was stopped &#8220;son interdit&#8221;. There were waves and only some swam. Most sat and drank beer and socialized looking after their kids. There is no point bringing snorkelling equipment to this beach as there was no coral or fish (on the other side is some coral and mediocre fish and a dive shop). An excellent lunch was served at 13:00 &#8211; a large salad, fries, chicken skewers (pay more for lobster) and fruit. We returned at 16:45 and sitting on the right got you soaked again.\u00a0<\/em><em><br \/>\n<\/em><strong><br \/>\nLes \u00eeles Moucha et Maskali<\/strong> Tentative World Heritage Site (05\/01\/2015).

Departs Djibouti City Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at 8:30 am (they tell you to come and queue up 2 hrs prior! no advance tickets, long lines, 700 fran ($4) one-way). You man are the only foreigner and may be able to bypass the line.<br \/>\nTadjourah itself is not pretty&#8230;You can either walk around and take the same ferry back in 1.5 hrs (enough!) departing around 1 pm and arriving back to Djibouti City 3:30 p.m. or you need to stay the night until the next ferry. Le Golfe hotel (5 min by tuktuk) is recommended.<br \/>\n<strong>Arta beach<\/strong> to snorkel\/swim with the whale sharks (difficult to reach by land, 40 min by boat but very expensive alone or 2 people &#8211; quotes $350 to $800) Often there are no other people to share, no groups. Expats, NGOs and Military people charter their own boats, not open to others to join. This is the only place to whale sharks (not Moucha Island). Don&#8217;t get a boat at the beach but at the wharf, as they are much more reliable and get help if needed.<br \/>\nAlso good snorkelling off the beach.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Djibouti \u2013 Djibouti, Arta, Ali Sabieh, Dikhil<\/strong><\/em><strong><em><br \/>\nBorders: <\/em><\/strong>Djibouti (sea border\/port), Djibouti-Ethiopia, Djibouti-Somaliland<strong><em><br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>M@P Southern Dikhil (Dikhil, Mouloud, As Eyla)<br \/>\n<strong><em>Tentative WHS<\/em><\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Aire naturelle terrestre prot\u00e9g\u00e9e d\u2019Assamo <\/strong>(05\/01\/2015).
