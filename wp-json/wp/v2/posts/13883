Egypt is bordered by Israel and the Gaza Strip to the northeast, by Sudan to the south and by Libya to the west. The country is bounded by the Mediterranean and Red Seas (to the north and east respectively) and geographically dominated both by the Nile River and its fertile well-watered valley and by the Eastern and Western deserts.<br \/>\nEgypt is perhaps best known as the home of the ancient Egyptian civilization, with its temples, hieroglyphs, mummies, and &#8211; visible above all &#8211; its pyramids. Less well-known is Egypt&#8217;s medieval heritage, courtesy of Coptic Christianity and Islam &#8211; ancient churches, monasteries and mosques punctuate the Egyptian landscape. Egypt stimulates the imagination of Western tourists like few other countries and is probably one of the most popular tourist destinations worldwide.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tourism.\u00a0<\/strong>Ever since the 2011 revolution, tourism (which provides about 15% of employment in Egypt, so one-sixth of the population are reliant upon it) has taken a major hit. Because of the downturn in tourism, expect more persistent and aggressive touts, but prices are lower and you can avoid the gigantic crowds that, at other periods, were typically overflowing the marvellous sites.<br \/>\nThe more recent counter-revolution and Military putsch, like many events of its sort, has brought repression, death sentences and imprisonment for many Egyptians (and foreign journalists) but has resulted in lower crime and reduced disruption for well-heeled foreign tourists.<br \/>\n<strong>Climate.\u00a0<\/strong>Egypt is largely a desert, an extension of the great Sahara that bands North Africa. Save for the thin strip of watered land along the Nile River broadening into the Nile delta, very little could survive here. Generally, the summers are hot and dry and the winters are moderate. November through March are the most comfortable months for travel in Egypt. There is almost no rain in the Nile Valley.<br \/>\nThe north coast along the Mediterranean Sea 50km southwards receives some of the most heavy rain in the country during winter months.<br \/>\nVisitors should be aware that most houses and apartments in Cairo and Egypt do not have central heating<\/p>\n<p><strong>Money.<\/strong>\u00a0Egyptian pound (EGP), often written as LE, (French\u00a0livre \u00e9gyptienne) or by using the pound sign \u00a3 with or without additional letters: E\u00a3 and \u00a3E.<br \/>\nHoard your small bills! Egypt has a perpetual shortage of small bills and change: even banks are reluctant to break too many bills. Vendors will also perpetually say they don&#8217;t have change and want small bills. Hoard your small bills as much as you can, be prepared to make bank runs for change, and break your bills in the easiest situations such as large supermarkets.<br \/>\n<em><strong>Black Market Money<\/strong><\/em>. The Egyptian pound has been devaluing gradually over the last several decades. Since 2011, the exchange rate has become relatively unstable and inflation sped up. As of 2013, the Egyptian pound was worth about 11 times less than at its peak.<br \/>\nAs of late 2016, the Central Bank has attempted to fix the value of the Egyptian Pound to the US dollar at a rate of EGP1:USD17.7. This has led to a shortage of foreign exchange and as of December 2014, a black market in foreign currency emerged. Dollars attract the greatest premium. Generally, high street foreign exchange offices will offer the black market rate &#8211; the rates they publish are to a large extent fictional.<br \/>\n<em>Exchanging money and banks. <\/em>In a black market economy, you can&#8217;t use banks or ATM.<br \/>\n<em>Credit cards:<\/em> Debit and credit cards are generally not accepted except at hotels, large supermarkets and shopping malls targeted at foreigners.<br \/>\n<em>Tipping.<\/em> Small bill tipping is encouraged as people are generally poor and tipping is a significant part of their income.<br \/>\n<strong>Scams.<\/strong> A common scam of vendors, ticket sellers, taxi drivers etc. will try is to claim that you only gave him a 10LE note, when you gave him a 100LE note &#8211; this can lead to a heated argument &#8211; best to treat it as an &#8216;honest mistake&#8217; so that the vendor does not lose face, then suggest that the police or tourist police can help. As a general rule whenever giving over large bills say out loud their value so both you and the vendor know the value of the notes.<br \/>\nShopping. In Egypt, prices are often increased for foreigners, so if you see a price on a price tag, it may be wise to learn the local Eastern Arabic numerals:<\/p>\n<p><strong>NOMAD MANIA EGYPT<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong><em>Experiences<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Cruise down the Nile<br \/>\nExperience Belly dance<br \/>\nHaggle at the bazaar<br \/>\nPlay\/hear <strong>sistrum. <\/strong>A\u00a0musical instrument\u00a0of the\u00a0percussion\u00a0family, chiefly associated with\u00a0ancient Egypt.

The choice of this location may have been due to its slightly closer proximity to Arabia and Mecca, the fear of strong remaining Christian and Hellenistic influence in Alexandria, and Alexandria&#8217;s vulnerability to Byzantine counteroffensives arriving by sea (which did indeed occur).<sup id=\"cite_ref-Raymond1993_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-:3_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup><br \/>\nThe most prominent architectural heritage of medieval Cairo, however, dates from the\u00a0Mamluk period, from 1250 to 1517 AD. The Mamluk sultans and elites were eager patrons of religious and scholarly life, commonly building religious or funerary complexes whose functions could include a mosque, madrasa,\u00a0khanqah\u00a0(for\u00a0Sufis), water distribution centers (sabils), and mausoleum for themselves and their families.\u00a0Among the best-known examples of Mamluk monuments in Cairo are the huge\u00a0Mosque-Madrasa of Sultan Hasan, the\u00a0Mosque of Amir al-Maridani, the\u00a0Mosque of Sultan al-Mu&#8217;ayyad\u00a0(whose twin minarets were built above the gate of\u00a0Bab Zuwayla), the\u00a0Sultan Al-Ghuri complex, the\u00a0funerary complex of Sultan Qaytbay\u00a0in the\u00a0Northern Cemetery, and the trio of monuments in the\u00a0Bayn al-Qasrayn\u00a0area comprising the\u00a0complex of Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun, the\u00a0Madrasa of al-Nasir Muhammad, and the\u00a0Madrasa of Sultan Barquq.<br \/>\n<span id=\"Shrines_and_mausoleums\" class=\"mw-headline\">Shrines and mausoleums.\u00a0<\/span>al-Hussein Mosque, the Mausoleum of Imam\u00a0al-Shafi&#8217;i.

This is the most important site in the world for the demonstration of this stage of evolution. It portrays vividly the form and life of these whales during their transition. The number, concentration and quality of such fossils here are unique, as are their accessibility and setting in an attractive and protected landscape.

Its fame comes from its being the first Capital of Ancient Egypt. The unrivalled geographic location of Memphis, both commanding the entrance to the Delta while being at the confluence of important trade routes, means that there was no possible alternative capital for any ruler with a serious ambition to govern both Upper and Lower Egypt. Traditionally believed to have been founded in 3000 BC as the capital of a politically unified Egypt, Memphis served as the effective administrative capital of the country during the Old Kingdom, then during at least part of the Middle and New Kingdoms (besides Itjtawy and Thebes), the Late Period and again in the Ptolemaic Period (along with the city of Alexandria), until it was eclipsed by the foundation of the Islamic garrison city of Fustat on the Nile and its later development, Al Qahira. As well as the home of kings, and the centre of state administration, Memphis was considered to be a site sacred to the gods.<br \/>\nThe site contains many archaeological remains, reflecting what life was like in the ancient Egyptian city, which includes temples, of which the most important is the Temple of Ptah in Mit Rahina. Ptah was the local god of Memphis, the god of creation and the patron of craftsmanship. Other major religious buildings included the sun temples in Abu Ghurab and Abusir, the temple of the god Apis in Memphis, the Serapeum and the Heb-Sed temple in Saqqara. Being the seat of royal power for over eight dynasties, the city also contained palaces and ruins survive of the palace of Apries overlooking the city. The palaces and temples were surrounded by craftsmen\u2019s workshops, dockyards and arsenals, as well as residential neighbourhoods, traces of which survive.<br \/>\nThe Necropolis of Memphis extends south and north and contains the Pyramid Complex of Saqqarathe, the first complex of monumental stone buildings in Egyptian history and royal tombs from the early shape called &#8220;mastaba&#8221; (the first pyramid ever built &#8211; the Pyramid of Djoser, or the Step Pyramid) until it reaches the pyramid shape. More than thirty-eight pyramids include the three pyramids of Giza, of which the Great Pyramid of Khufu is the only surviving wonder of the ancient world and one of the most important monuments in the history of humankind, the pyramids of Abusir, Saqqara and Dahshur, the Great Sphinx and the great statue of Rameses II at Mit Rahina. Besides these monumental creations, there are more than nine thousand rock-cut tombs, from different historical periods, ranging from the First to the Thirtieth Dynasty, and extending to the Graeco-Roman Period.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CAIRO\u00a0<\/strong>(21.3 million). The 2nd largest in Africa and in the Arab world, and the 6th-largest in the world. Cairo is associated with ancient Egypt, as the famous Giza pyramid complex and the ancient city of Memphis are located in its geographical area. Located near the Nile Delta, Cairo was founded in 969 AD by the Fatimid dynasty, but the land composing the present-day city was the site of ancient national capitals whose remnants remain visible in parts of Old Cairo. Cairo has long been a centre of the region&#8217;s political and cultural life and is titled &#8220;the city of a thousand minarets&#8221; for its preponderance of Islamic architecture.<strong><em><br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>Cairo has the oldest and largest\u00a0film\u00a0and\u00a0music\u00a0industries in the\u00a0Arab world, as well as the world&#8217;s second-oldest institution of higher learning,\u00a0Al-Azhar University.

The campaign in the Western Desert was fought between the Commonwealth forces (with, later, the addition of two brigades of Free French and one each of Polish and Greek troops) all based in Egypt, and the Axis forces (German and Italian) based in Libya. The battlefield, across which the fighting surged back and forth between 1940 and 1942, was the 1,000 kilometres of desert between Alexandria in Egypt and Benghazi in Libya. It was a campaign of manoeuvre and movement, the objectives being the control of the Mediterranean, the link with the east through the Suez Canal, the Middle East oil supplies and the supply route to Russia through Persia. EL ALAMEIN WAR CEMETERY contains the graves of men who died at all stages of the Western Desert campaigns, brought in from a wide area, but especially those who died in the Battle of El Alamein at the end of October 1942 and in the period immediately before that. The cemetery now contains 7,240 Commonwealth burials of the Second World War, of which 815 are unidentified. There are also 102 war graves of other nationalities. The ALAMEIN CREMATION MEMORIAL, which stands in the southeastern part of El Alamein War Cemetery, commemorates more than 600 men whose remains were cremated in Egypt and Libya during the war, under their faith. The entrance to the cemetery is formed by the ALAMEIN MEMORIAL.

The practice probably arose because from ancient times unmarried men and adolescent boys were required to live and work together outside the town of Shali.<br \/>\nAlthough Siwan men could take up to four wives, &#8220;Siwan customs allow a man but one boy to whom he is bound by a stringent code of obligations.&#8221; In 1937 the anthropologist Walter Cline wrote the first detailed ethnography of the Siwans in which he noted: &#8220;All normal Siwan men and boys practice sodomy&#8230;among themselves, the natives are not ashamed of this; they talk about it as openly as they talk about love of women, and many if not most of their fights arise from homosexual competition&#8230;.Prominent men lend their sons to each other. All Siwans know the matings which have taken place among their sheiks and their sheiks&#8217; sons&#8230;Most of the boys used in sodomy are between twelve and eighteen years of age.&#8221; Homosexuality was not merely rampant, it was raging&#8230;Every dancer had his boyfriend&#8230;[and] chiefs had harems of boys&#8221;.<br \/>\nIn the late 1940s, Siwan women were &#8220;badly neglected&#8221;, but Siwan men &#8220;will kill each other for a boy.

In 332 BC, Alexander the Great who was welcomed as a liberator, first went to Memphis, the capital of Pharaonic Egypt, to honour the Egyptian gods and to receive the royal investiture as Pharaoh, then to the village of Rakhotis to the west of the delta near the Mediterranean, to found Alexandria whose perimeter he drew himself and ordered his architect, Dinocrates of Rhodes, to draw up the plan. Then after only six months, he left Egypt. After he died in 322 BC, he was buried in Memphis for some time. He was then brought to Alexandria by Ptolemy for re-burial in the Sema or Soma necropolis which became that of his successors, the Ptolemy dynasty. His successors, Ptolemy I and his son Ptolemy II (285-246 BC) then the whole dynasty of the Ptolemies, developed the city, built numerous grandiose monuments and decorated it in the fashion both of the Greeks and the Egyptians.<br \/>\nThus in 641 AD Alexandria became a great metropolis receptive to both Egyptian and Hellenistic influences. The ancient city &#8220;Full of temples, theatres and colossal palaces, the city was magnificent, spreading five kilometres along the coast with a width of 1\u00bd kilometres. It was surrounded by powerful fortifications and was based on an irregular quadrilateral plan. It had different quarters for the Egyptians, Greeks and Jews, as well as necropolises and residential areas. It had two ports, as the stretch of water between the coast and the <strong>island of Pharos<\/strong> had been divided into two by Heptastades, through an approx. 1.800 m jetty which connected the island with the land.<br \/>\nTo the east was the Portus Magnus alongside which, from the small peninsula of Lochias right up to the quarter of Bronkhion, were the <strong>palaces of the Ptolemies, the Emporium and the Caesium<\/strong>, the temple which Cleopatra had built in Anthony&#8217;s honour and which was completed by Augustus and consecrated for the Imperial cult. The Heliopolis obelisks which stood in front of this monument are now in London and in New York. On an island connected to the land, Anthony built the <strong>Timonion<\/strong>, a royal palace to which he withdrew after the defeat of Actium. At the end of the islet of Pharos stood the <strong>tower of Pharos<\/strong> which gave its name to the signalling system which was so useful to the navigators. In the middle of the city was the <strong>Soma<\/strong> or Suma, the necropolis of the Ptolemies where Alexander was buried and the <strong>Museon<\/strong>, a college of erudite philosophers where the famous library founded by Ptolemy I was to be found and which was enlarged by his son Ptolemy II Philadelphus and organized by Demetrios Phaleris.<br \/>\nAlexandria, thanks to its port, rapidly became one of the great centres of commercial activity in Antiquity and replaced Tyre.<br \/>\nThe <strong>Lighthouse of Alexandria<\/strong> was commissioned by Ptolemy II with three superimposed elements which were square, octagonal and circular (the whole structure being over 120 m high). The lighthouse was one of the seven wonders of the world in antiquity. Its outline is known only from coins, a Byzantine mosaic discovered in Libya and the remains of a similar lighthouse in Taposiris Magna. Badly damaged due to the lack of maintenance because of Alexandria&#8217;s decline during the Byzantine era, it received a final blow during an earthquake which struck the region at the beginning of the XIIth century. The Mamelukes built in its place in the XVth century the present <strong>fort of Qayt Bey<\/strong> (XV century). Underwater excavations brought to light some elements which had fallen into the sea, some of which are blocks of over 50 tons which, aligned on the ground, could be part of the lighthouse&#8217;s socle.<br \/>\nIn less than a century, becoming greater than Carthage, it was deemed to be the most brilliant city after Rome where Greek culture sparkled in all its splendour. Euclides founded a school of mathematics which lasted for several centuries; there Archimedes of Syracuse made numerous discoveries. Hipparchus the father of astronomy, Eratosthenes of Cyrene, was known for his scientific geography, Heropheles the physician practised surgery there and many other scientists and scholars frequented the Museon and the library which made it famous for several centuries.<br \/>\n<strong>The Library of Alexandria<\/strong> contained between 400.000 and 700.000 rolls of papyrus dealing with all the sciences. When Julius Caesar landed in Egypt, a fire partially destroyed the library. Anthony reconstituted it with 200.000 volumes from Pergamon. A slanderous legend says that it was finally burned down by the Arab conqueror Amr Ibn al-As. In reality, the &#8220;Great Library&#8221; like the palace, probably disappeared between 270 and 250 A.D. It was certainly the greatest and the richest in the ancient world where famous people from all over the world, could be met there as well as in the Museum of which it was a part. This vast structure, which included conference halls, observatories, a park, a zoo and refectories, was unique in the world&#8221;.<br \/>\n<strong>Cleopatra<\/strong>, the last of the Ptolemy dynasty, was crowned in Alexandria; there she met Anthony and together they met their tragic end. The second city of the Roman empire with its 500.000 inhabitants, Alexandria enjoyed two more centuries of splendour. In 30 BC, Egypt became a Roman province. Vespasian was proclaimed emperor in Alexandria in 69 AD. Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius stayed there. Cleopatra &#8220;Between myth and reality, legend and history, the last of the Ptolemies is still full of fascination today. Daughter of Ptolemy XII, she acceded to the throne in 51 BC under the guardianship of the Roman senate represented by Pompey, at the same time as her brother and husband Ptolemy XIII. After Caesar&#8217;s death (44 BC) with whom she had a son, she seduced Mark Anthony, the new Master of the East. She won Phoenicia, Syria, Cyprus, part of Cilicia and the Nabatean Kingdom. The battle of Actium in 31 BC rang her death knoll. Octavius (the future Augustus) there defeated Anthony who, believing Cleopatra to be dead, committed suicide. Cleopatra, having first tried to seduce the victor, handed over Alexandria and then killed herself&#8221;.<br \/>\nChristianity spread very quickly and became the State religion in 392 AD. The Byzantine emperor Theodosius II ordered the destruction of the pagan temples including the famous Serapeum of Alexandria and Diocletian ordered the whole city to be sacked. A cosmopolitan cultural centre, Alexandria greatly contributed to the success of the new religion which found philosophical sustenance there and partly drew upon the tradition of ancient Egypt until the arrival of the Moslems in 642 AD.<br \/>\n<strong>What is there today<\/strong> of the ancient city?

Wadi Natrun is a 25 km long depression in the western desert halfway between Cairo and Alexandria where there are about a dozen saline lakes, two of which, the Bouha\u00efret el-Gounfadiya and the Bouha\u00efret el-Hamra, provide natron, the sodium carbonate used by the Pharaohs for mummification.<br \/>\n<em><strong>Monastery of St. Anthony<\/strong><\/em>. On the flank of Gabal al-Alaa al-Qibliya is the cave of St. Anthony where he lived until he died in 356 AD. The oldest monastery in Egypt. St. Anthony, with St. Pacomius (287-347 AD) was one of the first leaders of the Church, and founders of Christian monasticism. Anthony (251-356 AD) abandoned his property and retired to the Arab Desert to live there as a hermit. He chose the Gebel el Qalaa el-Qibliya to come closer to God and lived in a cave where his disciples founded a monastery.<br \/>\nThe village had a church built on top of the Saint\u2019s tomb (XIIIth century frescoes), chapels, bread oven, mills, cells and gardens that grew up around the cave and have survived up to the present day The church, has a square narthex and a square chancel and two wheat flour mills.<br \/>\n<em><strong>Monastery of St. Paulhe<\/strong><\/em>. Further to the west on the same mountain, this is where St. Paul lived for 60 years according to the legend at the beginning of the 4th century AD). Born in Thebaid around 225 AD, Paul became a hermit to escape from the persecutions of Christians under the emperor Decius, He crossed the desert and settled in a cave on the flank of Gabal el Qalaa el Qibliya, an inhospitable mountain scorched by the sun. He left numerous disciples behind at his death who, to perpetuate his memory, set up a community on the site of his tomb which became the nucleus of the present monastery. Smaller than St. Anthony, the St. Paul monastery had undergone less changes and today seems to be hemmed in with all its buildings within a medieval precinct. A square tower, a refuge for the monks in case of an attack, has chapels as at St. Anthony\u2019s, and also cells, storerooms and water supplied through an underground canal from the monastery\u2019s well. St. Paul\u2019s church is decorated with numerous paintings from the XVIIIth century, including those of saints on horseback, namely St. George, St. Theodore and Michael the Archangel striking at the demons.

Very quickly many isolated hermits settled in the region, and then fifty monasteries were established. Four of these monasteries survived. The most important and the biggest in Wadi Natrun and Egypt is St. Macarius. Developed remarkably in the VIth century, as it was used as a refuge by the Coptic Patriarchs of Alexandria. In 866 the church was rebuilt and the ramparts consolidated so it was able to survive to the present day. An imposing tower with three floors which was used as a refuge. The relics of St. Macarius, St. John the Baptist and the prophet Elisha are fervently venerated<br \/>\nThe Church of the Forty-Nine Martyrs recalls the massacre of the monastery\u2019s monks by desert plunderers in 444.<br \/>\nThe Monastery of St. Pschoi has five churches within a walled enclosure.

A\u00a0Coptic Orthodox\u00a0monastery\u00a0located in\u00a0Wadi El Natrun\u00a0in the\u00a0Nitrian Desert and the most northern among the four current monasteries of\u00a0Scetes, situated around 9\u00a0km northeast of the\u00a0Monastery of Saint Pishoy.<br \/>\nThe Paromeos Monastery is probably the oldest among the four existing monasteries of\u00a0Scetes. It was founded c. 335 A.D. by\u00a0Saint Macarius the Great. Destroyed in 407 A.D. by the\u00a0Berbers, it was rebuilt and destroyed again in\u00a0410 A.D, so in\u00a0859-880 built 10-11m high walls around the monasteries of the\u00a0Nitrian Desert. There were 12 monks in 1712, 9 in 1799, 30 in 1905, 35 in 1937, 20 in 1960 and 46 in 1970. Today, it has five churches.

The third-largest city in Egypt after Cairo and Giza, the seventh-largest city in Africa, and a major economic centre. The largest city on the Mediterranean \u2013 also called the &#8220;Bride of the Mediterranean&#8221; by locals \u2013 is the fourth-largest city in the Arab world and the ninth-largest urban area in Africa. The city extends about 40 km (25 mi) at the northern coast of Egypt along the Mediterranean Sea. Alexandria is a popular tourist destination, and also an important industrial centre because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez.<br \/>\nAlexandria was founded in\u00a0331 BC\u00a0by\u00a0Alexander the Great,\u00a0king\u00a0of\u00a0Macedon\u00a0and leader of the\u00a0Greek\u00a0League of Corinth, during\u00a0his conquest\u00a0of the\u00a0Achaemenid Empire. An Egyptian village named\u00a0Rhacotis\u00a0existed at the location and grew into the Egyptian quarter of Alexandria. Alexandria grew rapidly to become an important centre of\u00a0Hellenistic civilization\u00a0and remained the capital of\u00a0Ptolemaic Egypt\u00a0and\u00a0Roman and Byzantine Egypt\u00a0for almost 1,000 years, until the\u00a0Muslim conquest of Egypt\u00a0in AD\u00a0641, when a new capital was founded at\u00a0Fustat\u00a0(later absorbed into\u00a0Cairo). Hellenistic Alexandria was best known for the\u00a0Lighthouse of Alexandria\u00a0(<i>Pharos<\/i>), one of the\u00a0Seven Wonders of the Ancient World; its\u00a0Great Library\u00a0(the largest in the ancient world); and the\u00a0Necropolis, one of the\u00a0Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages. Alexandria was the intellectual and cultural centre of the ancient Mediterranean world for much of the\u00a0Hellenistic age\u00a0and\u00a0late antiquity.\u00a0It was at one time the largest city in the ancient world before being eventually overtaken by\u00a0Rome.<br \/>\nThe city was a major centre of early Christianity and the centre of the Patriarchate of Alexandria, which was one of the major centres of Christianity in the Eastern Roman Empire. In the modern world, the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria both lay claim to this ancient heritage.<br \/>\nBy the Arab conquest of Egypt in 641 AD, the city had already been largely plundered and lost its significance before re-emerging in the modern era. From the late 18th century, Alexandria became a major centre of the international shipping industry and one of the most important trading centres in the world, both because it profited from the easy overland connection between the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, and the lucrative trade in Egyptian cotton.<br \/>\nAlexandria Airport (HBE)<br \/>\n<strong>Ruins of Tanis.\u00a0<\/strong>An important archaeological site on the Tanitic branch of the Nile, which has long since silted up &#8211; in the northeastern Nile Delta. 1825: two pink granite sphinxes now in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre; 1939: royal necropolis.

Four-star Steigenberger Cecil Hotel was built in 1929 by the Metzger family as a romantic hotel, at Saad Zaghloul Square where Cleopatra&#8217;s needles had been, in front of the Corniche. Author Somerset Maugham stayed here, as did Winston Churchill and Al Capone. Moreover, the British Secret Service maintained a suite for their operations. It was seized by the Egyptian government after the revolution in 1952, and five years later the Metzger family was expelled from the country. In 2007, after a lengthy court battle, legal ownership of the hotel was returned to the Metzger family, who subsequently sold it to the Egyptian government. It operated for many years as the Sofitel Cecil Alexandria Hotel, until it joined the Steigenberger Hotels chain in 2014.<br \/>\n<strong>D\u00e9lices.\u00a0<\/strong>Hospitality Legends.
