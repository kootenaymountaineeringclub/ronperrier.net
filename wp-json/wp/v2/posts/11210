The camp was established and operated solely by the governing Usta\u0161e regime rather than by Nazi Germany as in the rest of occupied Europe.\u00a0It was one of the largest concentration camps in Europe\u00a0and it has been referred to as &#8220;the Auschwitz of the Balkans&#8221; and &#8220;the Yugoslav Auschwitz&#8221;.<br \/>\nIt was established in August 1941 in marshland at the confluence of the Sava and Una rivers near the village of Jasenovac, and was dismantled in April 1945. It was &#8220;notorious for its barbaric practices and the large number of victims&#8221;. It was founded and led by Ante Pavelic (1889-1959) who escaped to Italy, then Argentina and died in Madrid.<br \/>\nIn Jasenovac the majority of victims were ethnic Serbs; others were Jews, Roma, and some political dissidents. Jasenovac was a complex of five sub camps\u00a0spread over 210\u00a0km<sup>2<\/sup> (81\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) on both banks of the Sava and Una rivers. The largest camp was the &#8220;Brickworks&#8221; camp at Jasenovac, about 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) southeast of Zagreb. The overall complex included the Stara Gradi\u0161ka sub-camp, the killing grounds across the Sava river at Donja Gradina, five work farms, and the U\u0161tica Roma camp.<br \/>\nDuring and since World War II, there has been much debate and controversy regarding the number of victims killed at the Jasenovac concentration camp complex during its more than three-and-a-half years of operation. After the war, a figure of 700,000 reflected the &#8220;conventional wisdom&#8221;, although estimates have gone as high as 1.4 million.\u00a0The authorities of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia conducted a population survey in 1964 that resulted in a list of 59,188 victims of Jasenovac and Stara Gradi\u0161ka, the findings were not published until 1989. Croatian academic Vladimir \u017derjavi\u0107 published books in 1989 and 1992 in which he &#8220;meticulously analysed the available data&#8221; and concluded that some 83,000 people had been killed at Jasenovac. His findings were criticized by the director of the Museum of Victims of Genocide in Belgrade, Milan Bulaji\u0107, who defended his figure of 1.1 million, although his rebuttal was later dismissed as having &#8220;no scholarly value&#8221;. Since Bulaji\u0107&#8217;s retirement from his post in 2002, the Museum has no longer defended the figure of 700,000 to 1 million victims of the camp. In 2005, Dragan Cvetkovi\u0107, a researcher from the Museum, and a Croatian co-author published a book on wartime losses in the NDH which gave a figure of approximately 100,000 victims of Jasenovac.<br \/>\nThe United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) in Washington, D.C. presently estimates that the Usta\u0161a regime murdered between 77,000 and 99,000 people in Jasenovac between 1941 and 1945, comprising; &#8220;between 45,000 and 52,000 Serbs; between 12,000 and 20,000 Jews; between 15,000 and 20,000 Roma (Gypsies); and between 5,000 and 12,000 ethnic Croats and Muslims, political and religious opponents of the regime.&#8221; The Jasenovac Memorial Site quotes a similar figure of between 80,000 and 100,000 victims.<br \/>\nFor a complete description of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2019\/05\/20\/jasenovic-concentration-camp\/\">Jacenovic.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Stone Flower Monument.<\/strong> Created by Bogdan Bogdanovic (1922-2020), an architect and one time mayor of Belgrade, it is on a large meadow at the sight of the Camp III brickworks, the biggest camp in the Jasenovac Concentration Camp. It operated from November 1941-April 22 1945 as a work\/death camp. The majority were either hanged or killed with cold weapons or died from starvation and exhaustion. The victims were either killed as ethnic genocide \u2013 47,141 Serbs (the main reason for the camp was to eliminate Serbs), 11,148 Roma, 13,041 Jews \u2013 or people who opposed the Ustasha government \u2013 4,235 Croats and 1,129 Muslims from Bosnia and Herzegovina. 20,000 of the total 82,570 were children. Most of the women and children were housed in Stara Gradisha Concentration Camp 30kms form Camp III that operated from February 1942 to the end of 1944.<br \/>\nWhen the Ustasha retreated, they burned and ruined the buildings so none are preserved nor is anything that existed when the Yugoslav Army arrived. The townspeople of Jasenovac took the bricks to rebuild their damaged homes. By 1947, the area had returned to an overgrown meadow. It took 20 years before the survivors even marked the area with boards indicating the location of important buildings and their families started planning a monument.<br \/>\nBuilt in 1964-66, the Stone Flower Monument is a large cast concrete flower with four large petals coming from a central column and supported by two large concrete \u201cwings\u201d. It ended up having acoustic properties as the petals amplify sound. A museum was also created. In 1991-94, all the documents were removed to Banya Luca but only 70% were returned. The area needed to be demined and restoration was completed in 2006. A metal disc shows the location of various buildings also marked by mounds and wound depressions on the edge of two small connected lakes. Walk out on the long boardwalk made of railway ties to the monument.
