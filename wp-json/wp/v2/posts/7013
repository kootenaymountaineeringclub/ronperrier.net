One 5-centimetre angle, 3 Lost Arrows and 7 knife blades have been used. Chock placements seemed rare. It has been climbed using only chocks, or a set of Friends.

Go up to the right under the overhang, ending in a not obvious stance (5.2). With a longer rope, there are two variations across two blank sections to a good stance (5.8, fixed pitons).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Pitch 3. From the stance, climb up and right under the overhang, and then make an upward diagonal traverse right into a gray-black water stain which is a series of nice cracks and flakes, a long lead (5.8).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Pitch 4. Three possibilities, to the left (best), straight up, and to the right (avoid), from the stance. Go 3m left of the stance, and up to a fixed piton, and right 3m using layback underholds or friction (5.8) to a good stance.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Pitch 5.

Pitch 5 exits to the summit gully.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Pitch 6. Ascend the gully (5.6), which is difficult to protect.

One very long lead goes to the southwest ridge (5.2).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Pitch 7. Continue up the gully to a large alcove (5.6).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Pitch 8. Traverse a bit left from the boulder stance at the top of the gully, and then go straight up the left-facing dihedral to a roof. Climb the roof direct, or move right and then back left, to the dihedral above.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">A 50-meter rope was used.

It starts about 15m to the right of the original center route, about two-thirds of the way right across the south face. It ends on the upper east ridge, 300m.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Pitch 1. Scramble up to a small overhang providing access to a left-trending ramp\/crack system. Follow this (one bolt, one piton) to the base of a large V-shaped slot and a two-bolt anchor. Class 5.9, 45m<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Pitch 2. Climb the vertical arete defining the right edge of the V-slot to a featured slab and easier ground (four bolts) to a two-bolt belay in an open dish. Class 5.10, 25m<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Pitch 3. Climb up and trend right, passing a fixed piton and a few loose blocks, towards an obvious left-facing corner about 30m from the belay. Climb the corner (5.10) and continue up and right along a ramp system to where it is possible to easily move back left to a good ledge (rope drag; two bolt belay). Class 5.10, 55m<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Pitch 4. Go up a right-hand crack above the belay for a few meters, then move left across a ledge for a few meters. A vertical crack leads to a long left-leaning corner capped by a roof. Climb this beautiful corner to a small sloping stance; belay on good gear. Class 5.9, 30m<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Pitch 5. Continue the steepening corner toward the roof passing an insecure layback section (5.11). Look for protection placements (#1 and #2 Camalots) in odd triangular crack pockets on the right wall just before the very difficult layback. Continue more easily towards the intimidating roof, working out the left side of it before traversing back right along a wildly exposed sloping ledge to a two-bolt belay. Note: it is possible to combine pitches 4 and 5 but there are rope drag and gear problems. Class 5.11, 25m<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Pitch 6. A thin layback seam leads up and left past two bolts; move right over a steep flake passing a fixed piton. Beware of a precarious-looking (avoidable) flake above the piton. A steepening right-trending arch passes two more bolts (5.11) before moving left (another bolt), then skirting around the left side of an overhang on wild chicken heads to a small stance (two bolts). Class 5.11, 30m<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Pitch 7. A few exposed slabby moves to the right, past one bolt, leading to a thin arching crack capped by a small roof. Exit the roof through the left side on good gear (crux). Continue straight up with some insecure laybacking along a left-facing corner. Then easier terrain. A right-facing corner goes to the east ridge (two-bolt belay).
