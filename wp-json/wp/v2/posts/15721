At check-in for Qatar Airways in Cairo, I was not allowed to board. The check-in agent didn&#8217;t know that Iraq had a VOA and proceeded to read the entire IATA visa information and saw this: &#8220;Nationals of Canada can obtain a visa on arrival at Basra (BSR) for a maximum stay of 60 days. They must have a hotel reservation confirmation for 7 days at Minawi Pasha Hotel or Basra Touristic Hotel.&#8221; (You could substitute any country for Canada and the information was the same.). They were insistent and would not change. I tried to book the hotels listed but they were not on Booking.com and it turned out could not be booked online anywhere &#8211; creating an impossible situation.<br \/>Our guide (Haval) had mentioned that travellers were not being allowed to enter Basra without this 7-day hotel reservation but said that it was a scam perpetrated at the Basra Airport. He had clarified that the practice had been stopped and we only had a one-night reservation at a hotel different than the ones above. This would infer otherwise &#8211; it is on the official IATA website.<br \/>As it was now 3 am, I slept in the airport and caught an Uber back to the same hostel I had been in a week before.<br \/>I have since had many emails with Qatar Airlines about what happened. My main point was that if this policy was followed by every Qatar agent at check-in, then all flights by Qatar arriving at Basra would have no tourists on them. Nobody can satisfy the requirement. They only said that it was my responsibility to know the visa requirements and would not comment on this specific question.<br \/>As the flight was booked through an air travel company, any refund would have to be obtained from them, not Qatar Airlines. I will never fly with Qatar Airlines again.

It was the most important\u00a0<em>hajj\u00a0<\/em>route during the Abbasid Caliphate, between 750 to 850 CE, a period renowned as a golden age of Muslim civilization. At its peak of prosperity, markers and milestones were installed along the route that was provided with wells, pools, dams, palaces, houses, and partially paved to facilitate the passage of pilgrims. 27 major stations and 27 substations have been identified.<strong><br \/><\/strong><strong><br \/>BAGHDAD\u00a0<\/strong>(pop estimated at 6 to over 7 million) is the capital of Iraq and the second-largest city in the Arab world after Cairo. It is located on the Tigris near the ruins of the ancient Akkadian city of Babylon and the Sassanid Persian capital of Ctesiphon. In 762 CE, Baghdad was chosen as the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate and became its most notable major development project. Within a short time, the city evolved into a significant cultural, commercial, and intellectual center of the Muslim world. This, in addition to housing several key academic institutions, including the House of Wisdom, as well as a multi-ethnic and multi-religious environment, garnered it a worldwide reputation as the &#8220;Center of Learning&#8221;.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Baghdad was the largest city in the world for much of the Abbasid era during the\u00a0Islamic Golden Age, peaking at a population of more than a million.\u00a0<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>The city was largely destroyed at the hands of the Mongol Empire in 1258, resulting in a decline that would linger through many centuries due to frequent plagues and multiple successive empires. With the recognition of Iraq as an independent state (formerly the British Mandate of Mesopotamia) in 1932, Baghdad gradually regained some of its former prominence as a significant center of Arab culture. Compared to its large population, it has a small area of just 673 square kilometres (260 sq mi).<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The city has faced severe infrastructural damage due to the\u00a0Iraq War, which began with the United States-led\u00a0invasion of Iraq in 2003\u00a0and lasted until 2011, and the subsequent\u00a0insurgency\u00a0and renewed\u00a0war\u00a0that lasted until 2017, resulting in a\u00a0substantial loss of cultural heritage and historical artifacts. During this period, Baghdad had one of the highest rates of terrorist attacks in the world. However, terrorist attacks are rare and have been declining since the territorial defeat of the\u00a0Islamic State\u00a0militant group in Iraq in 2017.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Hotel. <\/strong>Life Palace Hotel and Restaurant.

Ever since the 10th century, Babylonian Jews have visited the tomb and only in the 12th century did Muslims begin to associate the site with a Quranic prophet &#8211; Dhul-Kifl, often identified as Ezekiel. In 1180, Jews held the keys to the site and 60,000 and 80,000 Jews converged on the tomb during the week of Sukkot.\u00a0<strong><br \/><\/strong>In 1860, the tomb became a source of contention when Muslims attempted to wrest control of the site. Upon the intervention of the Anglo-Jewish Association, a government emissary from Constantinople decided in favour of the Jews. Until the mid-20th century, over 5,000 Jews used to come to the tomb from Baghdad during Passover. The tomb walls contained various inscriptions including three poems. An adjoining room contained five tombs of Geonim. Another room is &#8220;Elijah&#8217;s Cave,&#8221; and a third room has tombs of the Daniel family of Baghdad who were custodians of the site. A Hebrew plaque above the doorway dating from 1810 read &#8220;This is the tomb of our master Yehezkel the Prophet, son of Buzi the Kohen, may his merit shield us and all Israel.

Under Cyrus and the subsequent Persian king Darius I, Babylon became the capital city of the 9th Satrapy as well as a center of learning and scientific advancement. In Achaemenid Persia, the ancient Babylonian arts of astronomy and mathematics were revitalized, and Babylonian scholars completed maps of constellations. The city became the administrative capital of the Persian Empire and remained prominent for over two centuries. The early Persian kings had attempted to maintain the religious ceremonies of Marduk, who was the most important god, but by the reign of Darius III, over-taxation and the strain of numerous wars led to a deterioration of Babylon&#8217;s main shrines and canals and the destabilization of the surrounding region. There were numerous attempts at rebellion and in 522 BC (Nebuchadnezzar III), 521 BC (Nebuchadnezzar IV) and 482 BC (Bel-shimani and Shamash-eriba) native Babylonian kings briefly regained independence.

Saddam saw himself as a modern reincarnation of Nebuchadnezzar, and to prove it, he spent millions building a massive reconstruction of Babylon.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span class=\"section-start-text\"><strong>The Ruins of Babylon<\/strong> <\/span>known as Babel, date back over 3,000 years.

US forces caused irreparable damage to the archaeological record. They caused substantial damage to the Ishtar Gate, one of the most famous monuments from antiquity. US military vehicles crushed 2,600-year-old brick pavements, archaeological fragments were scattered across the site, more than 12 trenches were driven into ancient deposits and military earth-moving projects contaminated the site for future generations of scientists.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The entrance to Babylon is a gate made from bright blue bricks and a gold overlay, looks like it could have been transplanted from Vegas, or Disneyland*.

The war showed no sign of ending, and Iraqis did not understand why they were fighting in a conflict they never asked for. To fuel support for the battle, Saddam turned increasingly to grand nationalist building projects. That was when he ordered the reconstruction of Babylon.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Saddam siphoned millions into the rebuilding and pushed to have the reconstruction built on the foundations of the original site. The project was not only nationalistic but also narcissistic and megalomaniacal. Saddam wanted every Iraqi to know that he rebuilt Babylon. The point is that it\u2019s not just an archaeological reconstruction of the city of Babylon for the sake of science and history and the past. It\u2019s an idealization of that history for the cementing of the legitimacy of the regime\u2019s presence.\u201d<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When Saddam heard that Nebuchadnezzar had stamped the bricks of ancient Babylon with his name and titles,\u00a0he ordered\u00a0that the reconstruction mimic this practice. To this day, in the maze behind the Southern Palace, scores of bricks are stamped with a declaration: \u201cIn the reign of the victorious Saddam Hussein, the president of the Republic, may God keep him the guardian of the great Iraq and the renovator of its renaissance and the builder of its great civilization, the rebuilding of the great city of Babylon was done in 1987.\u201d<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The war killed hundreds of thousands of soldiers.

Thirty thousand horsemen were sent against Husayn. Husayn had no army, he was with his family and few friends totaling 73 men. The horsemen denied Husayn and his followers water to force Husayn to give an oath of allegiance. On the 9th of Muharram, Husayn refused and on 10 Muharram, he did his morning prayer and led his troops into battle. Many of Husayn&#8217;s followers, including all of his present sons Ali Akbar, and Ali Asghar (six months old), and his nephews Qassim, Aun, and Muhammad were killed. Both Husayn ibn Ali and his brother Abbas ibn Ali were buried by the local Ban\u012b Asad tribe,<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In 682, Yazid ibn Mu&#8217;awiya released the surviving members of Husayn&#8217;s family from prison.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The first pilgrimage to the site was in 685.

It lies at the north end of the\u00a0Persian Gulf\u00a0and has a small (58km) coastline in the southeast of the country. It is surrounded by\u00a0Iran\u00a0to the east,\u00a0Kuwait\u00a0to the south,\u00a0Saudi Arabia\u00a0to the southwest,\u00a0Jordan\u00a0to the west,\u00a0Syria\u00a0to the northwest, and\u00a0Turkey\u00a0to the north. Iraq was the center of Mesopotamia, the cradle of civilization. The Shia holy cities of Najaf and Karbala are located in Iraq.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>HISTORY<br \/><\/strong>Iraq is the birthplace of many of the Earth&#8217;s oldest civilizations, including the Babylonians and the Assyrians. A part of the Greek Macedonian empire from 300 BC, the Treaty of S\u00e8vres brought the area under British control in 1918. Iraq gained independence in 1932. On 14 July 1958, the long-time Hashemite monarchy was overthrown in a coup led by Abd al-Karim Qasim that paved the way to radical political reforms, including the legalization of political parties such as the Ba&#8217;ath and the Communist Party, both key players in the coup (also called the\u00a014 July Revolution). Following this Revolution, the Soviet Union gradually became its main arms and commercial supplier.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In February 1963, Qasim was overthrown and killed in a second coup that brought the Ba&#8217;ath Party into power. Internal divisions would follow for the next five years, until another coup on 17 July 1968 led by Ahmad Hassan al-Bakr (with Communist support) stabilized the party. Relations between the Communists and the Ba&#8217;athists ranged from mutual cooperation to violent mistrust, culminating in the purge of Communists from the army and the government by 1978, causing a temporary rift with the Soviet Union. On 16 July 1979, Bakr resigned and was succeeded by the right-hand man Saddam Hussein, who carefully killed his enemies and became a dictator almost overnight.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The next twenty-five years took a grinding toll on the country. A long war with neighboring Iran in the 1980s cost hundreds of thousands of lives and billions of dollars. The invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and the subsequent Gulf War caused further casualties, followed by civil war inside the country and a decade of international sanctions.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The northern part of the country is inhabited by the Kurdish people and is called Kurdistan.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Iraq was invaded in 2003 by a mainly US-led coalition of forces, who removed Saddam Hussein from power. The northern part gained autonomy in 2005 and now its called\u00a0Kurdistan\u00a0where the majority Kurdish people live.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Climate.\u00a0<\/strong>Most of Iraq has a hot arid climate. Summer temperatures average above 48\u00b0C (120\u00b0F) for most of the country and frequently exceed 49\u00b0C (121\u00b0F). Winter temperatures infrequently exceed 22\u00b0C (73\u00b0F) with maximums roughly 16 to 17\u00b0C (61 to 62\u00b0F) and night-time lows occasionally below freezing. Typically precipitation is low, most places receive less than 250mm (10\u00a0in) annually with maximum rainfall during the months of November to April. Rainfall during the summer is extremely rare except in the very north of Iraq.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Get in.\u00a0<\/strong>Visitors from the following countries\/Areas; the\u00a0EU,\u00a0Andorra,\u00a0Australia,\u00a0Brazil,\u00a0Canada,\u00a0Iceland,\u00a0Iran,\u00a0Japan,\u00a0Kuwait,\u00a0Liechtenstein,\u00a0Monaco,\u00a0New Zealand,\u00a0Norway,\u00a0Qatar,\u00a0San Marino,\u00a0South Korea,\u00a0Switzerland,\u00a0Turkey,\u00a0United Arab Emirates,\u00a0United States, and\u00a0Vatican City\u00a0will get an entry stamp for max 15 days at\u00a0Erbil\u00a0or Sulaimaniyah International Airport.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>By plane.\u00a0<\/em>Baghdad International Airport (IATA:\u00a0BGW) is about 16km from the centre of Baghdad.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Get around<br \/><\/strong>In Kurdistan, public transport is rare although regular buses do link Zakho and Dohuk and cost about 2 USD. From Dohuk, shared taxis leave all day for Erbil and other cities. The road from Dohuk to Arbil goes south near Mosul, but does not leave Kurdish territory and is thus safe, although perhaps too close for comfort.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Shared Taxis might be the safest way to travel in Iraqi Kurdistan, as the drivers are not interested in leaving the province either.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>By car.\u00a0<\/em>Driving at night may be a safer alternative to daytime driving, but a few rules to follow. Avoid city centres. Although most Iraqis are asleep by midnight, the few that are awake are almost certainly up to no good.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Watch for the military. If you are out late at night and effectively trying to blend in with the locals, you could be mistaken for a hostile\/troublemaker. At checkpoints, you will also be treated as a suspect, and until they decide you are not a target, you must conduct yourself carefully. If you do encounter the military, ensure your lights are on (at night), slow or pull over to the side of the road and follow any and all instructions given. If you approach a checkpoint, turn your lights off. It&#8217;s a good idea to have an Arabic speaking guide with you in order to navigate through the tricky checkpoints in Southern Iraq.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Talk.\u00a0<\/strong>Arabic\u00a0is the official language of Iraq. However, the majority of Iraqi Arabs speak one of the two national varieties of Iraqi Arabic (Northern and Southern). The Northern variety known as Qeltu Iraqi is spoken in areas such as Mosul, Dohuk, and Kirkuk while the Southern variety known as Gilit Iraqi is spoken in Baghdad, Karbala, and Amarah. The varieties are named after the term for &#8220;I said&#8221; in each respective dialect.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">English is not commonly spoken and most travellers will not able to get by in the various shops, markets and cafes. The further downside is that speaking English will immediately identify you as an outsider. This is dangerous because of the strong underground network of Iraqis who inform attackers of possible target opportunities.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Buy <\/strong>10,000 Iraqi dinar (IQD) = 5.87 Euro (Oct 20,2021)<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Iraqi dinar is the official currency, however you will also be able to spend Euros \u20ac and US Dollars $ almost everywhere. Be aware that most people do not like to make change for large bills. Also note that any defects in the bills (creases, ink stamps from banks, tears, etc.) will raise suspicion that you are a counterfeiter. Don&#8217;t bring old bills with you, either. Carry mostly small bills in the form of Iraqi dinars for daily spending cash. Since the introduction of the new Iraqi dinar, its widespread acceptance and confidence has reduced the prominence of the USD, and many shopkeepers are now refusing to accept them. However, most people will still pay large hotel bills or rent payments using USD or EUR due to the sheer volume of notes required to pay with dinars. The conversion rate fluctuates from day to day and from town to town, but is around 1175 dinar to US$1. Inflation used to be relative high (65% a year since 2003) but in recent years it is much lower than before (11% in 2008), which makes the Iraqi dinar becomes an attractive target for investors, unlike the Vietnamese dong.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Learn the security features of the new dinar and dollar notes; the former Iraqi government was known to be making passable $20, $10, and $5 U.S. notes, and these counterfeiters are apparently still in business.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Eat<br \/><\/strong><em>Masgouf-<\/em> Considered as the national dish of Iraq. It is an open cut freshwater fish roasted for hours after being marinated with olive oil, salt, curcuma and tamarind while keeping the skin on. Traditional garnishes for the masgouf include lime, chopped onions and tomatoes, and flatbread.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>Tepsi Baytinijan<\/em>\u00a0Also very popular dish in Iraq. A baked casserole typically consisting of meatballs, aubergine, tomatoes, garlic, onions, and potatoes.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Drink.\u00a0<\/strong>The legal drinking\/purchasing age of alcoholic beverages is\u00a018.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Alcohol is widely available and street vendors can usually get alcohol if you really need it, but again this is just asking to be identified as an outsider. Furthermore, while alcohol is legal many insurgent groups in Iraq have targeted alcohol vendors and drinkers.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Sleep<br \/><\/strong>Sleep in the hot summer months can be difficult. Sleeping outside and near flowing water is the most comfortable setting one can find outside of air conditioning.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In Iraqi Kurdistan, there are plenty of hotels and although they are hard to find in any travel guide, anyone on the street will direct you to a nearby place. There&#8217;s no shortage in Zakho, Dohuk or Arbil. Rates run about 15 USD to 25 USD per night for a single room with bathroom.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Stay safe<br \/><\/strong>Iraq is beset with numerous problems that make traveling risky and difficult. The security situation is perilous in just about any area of the country, and continues to deteriorate under continuing terrorist attacks. Resistance to continuing military occupation, U.S. and UK forces, and Iraqi military, police or anyone associated with the Iraqi government, as well as increasing factional and sectarian conflict make street warfare, bombings, and other acts of armed violence daily occurrences.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The central third of the country is the most volatile; the southern ports are\u00a0less\u00a0dangerous, but only relatively so. However, northern Iraq, or Kurdistan is safe and has suffered from very little violence since 2003. Major cities, including Baghdad, are fertile grounds for political upheavals, kidnappings, and other underground activity, so tread lightly. The Kurdish peshmerga (military) is over 100,000 strong and every road, town, city and even village has checkpoints going in and out. All non-Kurds are searched thoroughly and occasionally followed by the internal secret police. However fear not, this is why there is almost no chance of terrorism in the North. The police are friendly and everyone is happy to meet foreigners, especially Americans.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Traveling alone makes you an easy kidnapping target, and is best avoided \u2013 if possible travel with a translator\/guard. There are comprehensive private and state security services available for your personal protection &#8211; you are strongly advised to use the available options for your own safety. If employed in Iraq, consult your employer on how to handle your personal safety. Independent contractors will usually have security provided by their clients, if no security is provided you should seriously consider not traveling to Iraq, if you must go you should hire armed security and get proper training in appropriate protective gear, survival, and weapons.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Be aware that Iraq, like the recently ended former war zone, has minefields everywhere especially in the desert, do not walk into fields, especially unmarked ones unless you&#8217;re absolutely sure that it&#8217;s safe.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">LGBT visitors. WARNING:\u00a0Homosexual private acts are illegal under morality laws with punishments up to 7 years in jail, fines, torture, and deportation. Vigilante executions, beatings and torture are a daily occurrance with government officials joining in, being complicit, or turning a blind eye. No accommodations are LGBT friendly and you will be denied, killed, beaten, tortured, and jailed when they realize you&#8217;re gay. Discrimination, abuse, honour killings, and murder are still common. Attacks on anyone LGBT had risen greatly after the global withdrawal from Iraq and with ISIS invasion, and while ISIS was defeated in 2017 in Iraq, lethal threats remain for LGBT visitors. If you are gay, stay out of Iraq.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Stay healthy<br \/><\/strong>It is best to always drink bottled water. It will usually be sold at vendors and large stores, and will be easy to find. Most Iraqi water companies pump their water directly from the Tigris or Euphrates rivers, treat it with ozone, and then filter it into bottles. The taste is often not very good, and those with sensitive systems should not drink it. Many street vendors will offer drinks such as water with a lemon twist, which should be presumed unsafe for foreign visitors.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Those with experience in Iraq should use their discretion and past experience when purchasing drinks.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Drinking the local tea (chai) can be safe for some people since it is brought to a boil before serving, but when in doubt, insist that bottled water be used. Many kinds of water-borne disease, pollution, and infectious agents are not affected by boiling of water, and are still present in the water after boiling.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As a walk past an Iraqi butcher shop will demonstrate, food preparation standards are not the same as in Western countries, and consumption of local food can make a visitor ill. Try to bring your own. As tap water is generally not potable, you should especially avoid uncooked foods.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Should you find your body in the uncomfortable position of rejecting food and water due to something you shouldn&#8217;t have drunk, immediately find someone who speaks Arabic and send them to a local pharmacist and request a product known locally as &#8220;InterStop&#8221; (similar to co-phenotrope\/Lomotil). This works better than any well-known western brands.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Respect<br \/><\/strong>Never show the soles of your feet to others. This may be considered very disrespectful by most Iraqis, unless you are in the company of friends. When in the company of friends, it&#8217;s still best to excuse yourself before putting your feet up in the air with the soles of your feet in the direction of any person.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Don&#8217;t spit in public or in the direction of others, even when obviously done without malice.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In most major cities, avoid addressing or glorifying the Saddam Hussein regime.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><\/span><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>IRAQMy original trip to south Iraq was to be Nov 14-24, 2021, but that didn&#8217;t happen.I flew from Sharm El Sheikh in the Egyptian Sinai to Cairo.
