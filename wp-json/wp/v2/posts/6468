Wilderness it\u2019s not, as it has a trail system that would put those in our national parks to shame. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Anyway, here\u2019s the way to Shedroof Mtn. Cross the border at Nelway and drive south on W 31 for about 15 km. Turn left onto the paved #9345, drive to Sullivan Lake campground, turn left on #22, and continue to the pavement\u2019s end (8.3 km. from W 31). Re-set your odometer. Continue on the good gravel road for about 9 km. to a major junction. Bear left on #2220 signed for Salmo Mt. (the right fork takes you over Pass Creek Pass and down to Priest Lake, Idaho). I should point out that about 6 km. east of Sullivan Lake, the road became hard-packed snow with some icy-looking surfaces. It looked to be heavily travelled by hunters; I saw their camps and trucks but never saw one during my travels on foot. Continuing on #2220, pass the Gypsy Meadows turnoff on the left at km. 18.4; now drive 1 km. more and look carefully for your goal, the signed Shedroof Cutoff Trail #511 on the right. Drive 30 m. up this spur to a parking spot and the trailhead (2 hrs. drive and 109 km. from Nelson). <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">There was 15 cm. of snow on the ground when I started out afoot at 11:00 am (you can see this was a leisurely day). Following a hunter\u2019s tracks, I walked an abandoned roadbed for 30 min. until the beginning of the trail proper. A vigorous 15 min. of switchbacking got me to a col and the junction (signed, of course) with Trail #512. I turned left or north and followed the sign saying Shedroof Mtn. After 55 min., the hunter\u2019s tracks disappeared, and I continued on the snowy, but clearly discernible, path. After about 90 min., the trail descended to an obvious notch with an unsigned junction; I took the right fork, which ascended, and at 12:45 reached the forested summit. I found the footings of a lookout, an old outhouse, a snow cover of about 20 cm., and an appropriately weathered, hand-carved sign stating \u201cShedroof Mtn. 6764\u2019.\u201d Views to the south revealed the Idaho and Washington Selkirks, looking surprisingly rugged clothed in \u201cfreshies,\u201d and the lake-like Pend Oreille River.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">To the north and west, the view was blocked by trees, but the three bumps of nearby Snowy Top were clearly visible. After a 15-minute lunch under sunny skies and in windless conditions, I headed down. I returned to the truck in 1 hr. 20 min. and was back in Nelson by 4:15 in plenty of time to prepare for Halloween. In sum, the good trail right to the summit makes this is a suitable late-season post-snowfall outing. All driving is on 2WD roads. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Kim Kratky.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SHEDROOF DIVIDE TRAIL #512 This is an up-and-down ridge along the Shedroof Divide in the Salmo-Priest Wilderness in the Washington Selkirks.
