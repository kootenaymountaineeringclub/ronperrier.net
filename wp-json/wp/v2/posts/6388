Overfishing could be threatening shortfin makos, treasured by fishermen for their fight and their meat.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>By Glenn Hodges August 2017 National Geographic Magazine<\/p>\n<p>Zane Grey made his name writing adventure novels about the American West, but his real love wasn\u2019t gunslinging or cowpoking; it was deep-sea fishing. He held 14 world records for catching saltwater fish, including the first billfish over 1,000 pounds landed with a rod and reel, a marlin he caught in Tahiti in 1930. But nothing compared to the shortfin makos he encountered off the coast of New Zealand in 1926. The first mako Grey got on the line was a 258-pounder, and when he reeled it to the side of the boat, \u201cquickly I learned something about mako!\u201d he wrote in his book Tales of the Angler\u2019s Eldorado, New Zealand. \u201cHe put up a terrific battle, broke one gaff, soaked us through with water, and gave no end of trouble.\u201d Once the shark was landed, Grey marveled at its build\u2014streamlined, muscular, with a head like a bullet. \u201cI had never seen its like,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEvery line of this mako showed speed and power.\u201d But it was the 1,200-pounder that the captain of his boat battled that led to almost mythical superlatives. After a long fight in which the mako \u201cleapt prodigiously and made incredible runs,\u201d the shark bit through the leader and escaped. \u201cI was terrified,\u201d the captain told Grey. \u201cIt seemed that mako filled the whole sky. He was the most savage and powerful brute I ever saw, let alone had on a line!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Almost a century later, shortfin makos still have a herculean reputation among fishermen, who love them for their fight and their meat in equal measure. But a century of fishing appears to have taken a toll. Shortfin makos \u2014 which are distinguished from their much rarer cousins, longfin makos, by, among other things, their shorter pectoral fins \u2014 are eagerly targeted by recreational fishermen and frequently caught as bycatch by commercial long-liners. Their meat rivals swordfish in quality, and their fins are prized in Asia for shark fin soup, a combination that has put makos under significant pressure. But how much pressure, and to what ultimate effect, is uncertain. Scientists have no clear idea how many makos there are in the Earth\u2019s oceans, and most of the data on catch and mortality rates come from commercial fishing operations, which famously tend to underreport catches. So biologists studying makos are trying to fill in some huge knowledge gaps.<\/p>\n<p>In the summer of 2015 I was invited to join a mako-tagging operation off the Maryland coast with scientists trying to bridge some of those gaps. I thought it would go like this: We catch big makos; they put on the kind of show that Zane Grey saw; and I get great coloUr for this story. Instead, I learned firsthand that Mark Twain was right about seasickness (\u201cAt first you are so sick you are afraid you will die, and then you are so sick you are afraid you won\u2019t\u201d) and was woozily indifferent when the fishermen on board reeled in two small makos, neither of which put up much of a fight. So I decided to try again\u2014this time with a seasickness patch\u2014in Rhode Island later in the summer. And that\u2019s when I saw what I really needed to see.<\/p>\n<p>On each trip I accompanied scientists affiliated with the Guy Harvey Research Institute, which has been tagging and tracking makos in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico since 2008, with the primary objective of studying the sharks\u2019 movement patterns. Makos in the western North Atlantic are highly migratory, traveling northward during the warmer months and then south as winter approaches. The excursions off Maryland\u2019s coast in May were a resounding success: Over two weeks, 12 makos were fitted with satellite transmitters. By contrast, the Rhode Island excursions in August were a resounding failure: one week, zero makos. But that contrast offered a clue as to what might be happening with makos in the Atlantic.<\/p>\n<p>To pick up on the clue, you have to know one of the first things you learn when you\u2019re fishing for makos: They share territory with blue sharks. The two species are kind of like lions and hyenas, coexisting in the same areas as they pursue different feeding strategies. Shortfin makos are the fastest sharks in the ocean, capable of reaching 35 miles an hour as they chase down speedy prey such as bluefish and tuna, and sport fishermen love their power. Blue sharks, on the other hand, are relatively laconic and focus on slower prey, like squid. Catching them is like, in one fisherman\u2019s words, \u201creeling in a barn door,\u201d and their meat is not nearly as good to eat as a mako\u2019s. So you can guess which one is the lion in the analogy and which is the hyena. Everyone wants to bag the lion.<\/p>\n<p>On our second day out of Narragansett, Rhode Island, as we hauled yet another blue shark to the side of the boat, I finally took note of the obvious. \u201cIt seems like all the blue sharks have hooks in their mouths,\u201d I said. Brad Wetherbee, the marine ecologist from the University of Rhode Island who was there to tag any makos we caught, said, \u201cYup. Every one we\u2019ve brought back to the boat so far has had a hook in it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Removing a hook from a shark\u2019s mouth can be dangerous, so fishermen just cut the leaders and leave the hooks to rust away. And because the fishermen are after makos, they\u2019re much more likely to release blue sharks. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a mako with a hook,\u201d the ship\u2019s mate, Lucas Berg, told me our first day out. \u201cPeople don\u2019t ever let them go. But we\u2019ve caught blue sharks with four hooks in their mouth.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The fishing pressures on makos are intense, Wetherbee explained. The ones we were trying to catch swim northward up the Atlantic coast in the summer, and between everyday recreational fishing and the dozens of shark-fishing tournaments held between Maryland and Rhode Island, it\u2019s a perilous journey for the sharks. \u201cA lot of them have been weeded out by the time they get up here,\u201d Wetherbee said. \u201cIs the catch rate sustainable?\u201d I asked him. Makos, like many sharks, are especially vulnerable to overfishing because of their small litters and high age of sexual maturity. (One study suggests that female makos don\u2019t reach maturity until around 15 years old or later, but these figures are not definitive. Biologists agree more research is needed.) \u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are far-ranging, international sharks\u2014some of our [tagged] makos have gone into the waters of at least 17 different countries\u2014and there\u2019s not enough data for management agencies to come up with a good estimate of whether the population is going up or down or staying the same. There\u2019s probably some number of mako sharks that would be fine to catch and kill. But we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s 100, or 1,000, or 100,000.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>According to the National Marine Fisheries Service, which regulates fishing in U.S. waters, makos are being fished at a sustainable level. This assessment is based largely on catch figures supplied by commercial long-liners to the international organization that regulates fishing for tuna and other pelagic fish in the Atlantic, and those figures show a relatively consistent harvest over recent years, suggesting that mako populations are stable. But the figures are an imprecise measure. The catch is recorded in metric tons, and basic information like the number of sharks caught, and the size and sex of those sharks, can be missing. On top of that, many catches go unreported, leading scientists to question the reliability of both the data and the stock assessments.<\/p>\n<p>What Wetherbee and his team do know is that the sharks they\u2019re tagging are not faring well. The tags they use\u2014about the size of a Zippo lighter, mounted on the dorsal fin\u2014send signals to satellites every time the sharks surface, allowing researchers to create detailed maps of their movements. When the signals start coming from land, they know the sharks have been caught. \u201cWe\u2019ve tagged 49 makos, and 11 have been killed,\u201d Wetherbee told me. (Within a month, that number had increased to 12.) I said that seemed like a lot, and he agreed: The sample size is small, but the catch rate is troubling. Back on land, I called Mahmood Shivji, the Nova Southeastern University scientist who leads the tagging project. \u201cWhat amazes me,\u201d he said, \u201cis that it\u2019s a vast ocean out there and these animals move a lot, and yet these tagged animals are running into fishing hooks to the tune of 25 percent. No shark fishery can sustain a 25 percent removal every year.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After my seasick cruise, I returned to the Maryland shore for Mako Mania, an annual shark-fishing tournament held at the Bahia Marina in Ocean City. This Mako Mania should not be confused with the Mako Mania tournament in Point Pleasant, New Jersey\u2014or, for that matter, with the Mako Fever tournament in New Jersey or the Mako Rodeo tournament, also in New Jersey, or with any of the other 65 or so U.S. tournaments that include prizes for pelagic sharks like makos, threshers, and tiger sharks. After Jaws hit theatres in 1975, tournaments popped up along the eastern seaboard, and ever since, summer has not been a good time to be a shark in the North Atlantic.<\/p>\n<p>I arrived at the marina just as the first sharks were being brought to the docks. It was a festive scene\u2014hundreds of people eating and drinking and cheering for the anglers and their kills. Next to me a woman and a young boy watched as a 282-pound mako\u2014the winner in the mako category, it turned out\u2014was hoisted to be weighed. The anglers pulled up the snout for photographs, and the woman turned to the boy and said, \u201cThis is really cool, right?\u201d The boy nodded silently, transfixed by the shark\u2019s bloody grimace.<\/p>\n<p>As the sharks continued rolling in\u2014147-pound mako, 466-pound thresher, 500-pound thresher, 174-pound mako\u2014I talked with the tournament\u2019s organizer, Shawn Harman. \u201cWhat\u2019s more fun than seeing sharks?\u201d he asked, surveying the cheering crowd. When we got to some of the knottier questions about the controversy over \u201ckill tournaments,\u201d as critics call them (versus \u201cno kill\u201d or \u201ccatch and release\u201d tournaments, which are rare but do exist), he explained that his tournament was not like those of old\u2014back in the 1970s and \u201980s, when the sharks would pile up on the docks and go wholesale into the Dumpster afterward. Here, the only sharks brought to the dock were threshers and makos, the best tasting sharks in the ocean, with minimum sizes and a catch limit of one fish per boat per day. (Over the course of three days, 16 sharks were brought to the dock to be weighed.) \u201cNobody\u2019s wantonly killing fish here. Everyone here eats what they kill.\u201d I asked him where I might find mako on the menu, to see what it tastes like, and he fetched a fillet from one of the sharks just brought in, had it blackened, and served it to me on a bun with wasabi mayo. It was delicious\u2014as good as any billfish I\u2019d ever had.<\/p>\n<p>But the tasty sandwich and the festivity of the scene could not entirely conceal the problematic nature of the event. Later in the day, one of the fishermen told me that a 500-pound thresher shark brought in earlier had been pregnant, and when it was gutted, the tournament staff tried to hide the pups from the crowd. Threshers, like makos, are considered \u201cvulnerable\u201d by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and though killing the pregnant females of vulnerable species may be legal, it makes for bad publicity. I asked Harman about the pregnant shark. He denied the story, so I asked one of the guys cleaning the fish, and he said yes, there had been three or four pups, each two to three feet long. I went back to Harman to ask him why he denied it. He got a little flustered and told me he was afraid of being the \u201cbad guy\u201d in the story. \u201cWe\u2019re following the law, according to what the law says is sustainable,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they make it illegal, we\u2019ll stop.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The captains of the boats I went out in for those tagging operations in Maryland and Rhode Island are both longtime shark fishermen. They are not reflexively against the capture and killing of fish, and they are not squeamish about what deep-sea fishing entails. But both men have qualms about how sharks are being fished. Mark Sampson, the Maryland captain, started a prominent shark-fishing tournament in Ocean City in 1981 and ran it for more than three decades. But he became increasingly concerned about the conservation of shark populations, so he made his size limits more restrictive to reduce the number of sharks caught. He also insisted that anglers use \u201ccircle hooks,\u201d which, in contrast to conventional \u201cJ-hooks,\u201d don\u2019t lodge in a shark\u2019s stomach when swallowed and result in fewer unnecessary killings. Some fishermen balked, participation declined, and because of the higher size limits, he said, \u201cwe had days in our tournament where not a single shark was brought back to the dock. \u201cThat\u2019s not the recipe for a successful tournament, because people want to see those fish being brought in and weighed,\u201d Sampson said. He shuttered his tournament in 2014, and he doesn\u2019t accept charters for anglers who want to use his boat to participate in other shark tournaments.<\/p>\n<p>Charlie Donilon, the Rhode Island captain, has run shark-fishing charters since 1976. Where Sampson is quiet and circumspect, Donilon is talkative and emotional, and on one of those days in August when we were on the boat waiting for the fish to bite, he told me about the time a client reeled in a mako that refused to go gently. \u201cI threw a harpoon in it, then I hit it with a flying gaff, and then tied it down to a side cleat, and the thing is scratching and blasting blood everywhere, and it\u2019s all being recorded by the client. The guy sent me the video, and I watched it with my wife, and she asked, \u2018Does that bother you?\u2019\u201d It did, he said, and he started trying to persuade his customers to release the sharks they caught. \u201cI\u2019d tell people, a 100-pound mako is just a tot, just a kid, because they have the potential to grow to 1,000 pounds or more. So I\u2019d really like to let it go, because it\u2019s an immature fish.\u201d But since almost all the makos they catch out there are juveniles, it stopped making sense to even ask the anglers. So in 2015 Donilon instituted a catch-and-release policy, no exceptions. His business has taken a hit. \u201cI\u2019m way off what I used to be,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>I thought of all the blue sharks we\u2019d seen with hooks in their mouths, and it seemed to me he was right: pretty slim. Although most of the tagging study\u2019s casualties had been killed by commercial fishermen in international waters\u2014not by recreational fishermen\u2014the Fisheries Service\u2019s statistics attribute the majority of the mako kills in the U.S. to recreational fishermen. So who is fishing too much, and where? Empirically, it\u2019s still too soon to say. But Donilon, at least, doesn\u2019t need to wait for more data to render his verdict.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI did my share of killing,\u201d he said one afternoon on the boat. \u201cYou know how there might be a guy in Africa who used to be a poacher, and he used to kill all the lions \u2026\u201d And as he said this, his eyes teared up and his voice started quivering, and finally he choked out a half whisper: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to give back. We just take, take all the time \u2026\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ultimate Hunter<\/strong><br \/>\n\u201cTorpedoes with teeth.\u201d That\u2019s how photographer Brian Skerry describes shortfin makos. \u201cThat conical nose just pierces through the ocean.\u201d Though mature females can exceed 1,300 pounds, the sharks remain fast enough to ambush speedy tuna.<br \/>\nThough not as big as great whites or tiger sharks, shortfin makos are among the most versatile marine predators, built to race and range. Able to hit 35 miles an hour while chasing prey, they\u2019re the fastest sharks over short distances. Because they can maintain the temperature of key body parts, they venture into depths and latitudes too cold for most other shark species.<br \/>\nLike all sharks, makos have teeth optimized for their prey. Needlelike teeth allow them to grab and hold some of the ocean\u2019s fastest targets\u2014tuna, swordfish, and other sharks.<br \/>\nActual size: Max. length: 13 feet. Max. weight: 1,300 pounds<br \/>\nMaximum annual mako migration distance: 2,485 miles<br \/>\nMaximum daily distance traveled by juvenile makos: 62 miles<br \/>\nShortfin makos are highly migratory sharks, usually preferring waters within 500 feet of the surface.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Superior Swimmer<\/strong> &#8211; the fastest shark<br \/>\nTop speed (miles an hour): Michael Phelps 4.3, Atlantic bluefin tuna 25, Great white 30, Shortfin mako 35 (top swimming speeds are approximations. No reliable maximums have been recorded in the wild)<br \/>\nAverage cruising speed: Shortfin mako 4.2, Great white 5.0, Blue 1, Yellowfin tuna 2.8<br \/>\nWhat makes mako sharks the fastest sharks in the ocean?  Shortfin makos are considered the fastest sharks over short distances, superior even to great whites when it comes to quick bursts of speed. Makos hold a substantial edge over its competition when it comes to physiology.<br \/>\nEndothermic. Mako can maintain warmth in some body parts. The energy efficiency gives them multiple advantages such as improved swimming performance. Three heat exchange systems allow the mako to retain heat in the red muscle, liver and digestive organs and the eyes and the brain producing higher temperatures than that of surrounding water. Heat is transferred between cold and warm blood vessels. All sharks lose heat in their gills, but the mako&#8217;s unique arrangement of veins and arteries allows transfer of heat between warm and cold blood, trapping heat around viscera and red muscle and pumping warm blood to the brain.<br \/>\nStronger Tail. The mako&#8217;s caudal keel &#8211; a ridge on the back &#8211; is flat, which supports the fins and decreases drag as the tail moves side to side.<br \/>\nSmoother Stroke. Centrally placed red muscle connects only at the mako&#8217;s tail, creating a smooth, efficient power stroke. A blue shark&#8217;s red muscle connects to other muscles and the skin, resulting in a less streamlined pattern.<br \/>\nLarger Appetite. The mako&#8217;s warmer body temperature expands its range, but its faster metabolism increases the amount of food it needs.<br \/>\nGreater Stamina. Like distance runners, sharks rely on red muscle, made of slow twitch fibres to power their emigrations. In makos, red muscle creates heat and more proteins that boost oxygen flow.<br \/>\nQuicker Acceleration. White muscle, made of fast twitch fibres, acts swift acceleration. The mako&#8217;s white muscle quickly takes in oxygen, allowing it to recover rapidly for more frequent sprints.<br \/>\nBetter Breathing. The large suface area of the mako&#8217;s extensive gills helps it efficiently absorb oxygen, which is then distributed through the blood. Its large heart pumps more blood.

Mature females bear as few as four young every three years.<br \/>\nA mako prowls near a drifting clump of kelp off the San Diego coast. Such patches of floating kelp anchor miniature ecosystems, with larger fish preying on smaller fish and makos at the top of the food chain.<br \/>\nThis juvenile mako \u201ccame in hot,\u201d says Skerry, and destroyed part of his camera\u2019s housing. Though makos rarely attack humans, the human threat to the sharks is substantial. In 2007 they were classified as vulnerable because of overfishing.<br \/>\nThree sharks is a crowd for makos, which tend to be solitary and highly migratory, sometimes crossing the waters of more than a dozen countries. One shark tagged near New Zealand, where mako populations are robust, traveled 11,600 miles in a year.<br \/>\nA young mako lies gutted on the dock of Star Island Marina in Montauk, New York, site of an annual shark-fishing tournament. More than 60 tournaments, targeting shortfin makos, threshers, and tiger sharks, are held along the eastern seaboard each summer.<br \/>\nParasitic copepods cling to the fin of a shortfin mako. They feed on different parts of the shark\u2019s body, eating everything from mucus and blood to upper layers of skin.<br \/>\nDonilon accepts the loss of business because it doesn\u2019t seem to him that the fishing is sustainable, no matter what the government says. \u201cThe sharks we tag, there\u2019s like a gantlet they have to go through coming up the coast. They\u2019ve got to go through Maryland, New Jersey, Long Island, Massachusetts\u2014and everyone in the world is out there fishing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to be at least 15 years old in order to reproduce, the females. Now what are the odds of that shark making it up here 15 times without being caught?
