Following Columbus&#8217;s arrival, up to 90% of the indigenous population perished in the century following 1492 with estimates 55 million deaths due to disease (new infectious diseases included smallpox, bubonic plague, chickenpox, cholera, the common cold, diphtheria, influenza, malaria, measles, scarlet fever, sexually transmitted diseases (with the possible exception of\u00a0syphilis), typhoid, typhus, tuberculosis (although a form of this infection existed in South America prior to contact), and pertussis). Before Cortez\u2019s arrival, the Mexican population was estimated at 25 to 30 million. Fifty years later, the number was 3 million, primarily due to infectious diseases. <strong>Cocoliztli <\/strong>(the Great Pestilence) caused about 15 million deaths during the 16<sup>th<\/sup> c,\u00a0making it one of the deadliest disease outbreaks in history. It was a mysterious illness characterized by high fevers and bleeding.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Four different epidemics in the\u00a0Plains tribesbetween 1837 and 1870.

In some areas, the native population fell by as much as 90%. Some historians have described the epidemic as a deliberate\u00a0genocide\u00a0because the Colony of Vancouver Island and the\u00a0Colony of British Columbia\u00a0could have prevented the epidemic but chose not to, and in some ways facilitated it.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>SG\u0331ang Gwaay <\/strong>(&#8220;Red Cod Island&#8221;, Ninstints) is a village site of the Haida people, part of the Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Haida name for Anthony Island. It has the largest collection of Haida\u00a0totem poles\u00a0in their original locations, all of which are celebrated as great works of art, though Haida are allowing them to succumb to the natural decay of the lush\u00a0temperate rainforest\u00a0climate.

In the succeeding years, the population continued to decline due to other introduced diseases. By 1875 the site was used primarily as a camp, and by 1878 all the remaining people of SGang Gwaay Llanagaay had all moved to Skidegate.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">NM should make this a Dark Side site.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019m not sure what this says about me, but Nomad Mania runs my life.
