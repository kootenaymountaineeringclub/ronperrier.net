All three countries meet at the Mount Blanc massif.<br \/>\n<strong>Fort di Bard.<\/strong>\u00a0 This is a fortified complex built in the 19th century by the\u00a0House of Savoy\u00a0on a rocky prominence above\u00a0Bard, a\u00a0town\u00a0and\u00a0<i>comune<\/i>\u00a0in the\u00a0Aosta Valley.\u00a0Fort Bard has been completely restored after many years of neglect. In 2006 it reopened to tourists as the Museum of the Alps, it has additional art exhibitions and galleries. In the summer, the main courtyard is used to host musical and theatrical performances.<br \/>\nThe fort, which is at the entrance to the Aosta Valley, is located in a narrow gorge above the\u00a0Dora Baltea\u00a0river. It has been used for millennia to control the historic route between Italy and France. The current fortifications were built by\u00a0Charles Albert of Savoy\u00a0between 1830 and 1838. It replaced a 10th-century castle that had, itself, been built on an earlier structure founded by\u00a0Theodoric I\u00a0in the 5th century. The castle was under the control of the powerful local lords of Bard until the middle of the 13th century when ownership passed to the House of Savoy. Under their control, the defences were strengthened and improved.<br \/>\nOn May 14, 1800, a 40,000-strong French army\u00a0was stopped\u00a0by 400 Austro-Piedmontese soldiers at Fort Bard. They held the pass for two weeks, completely ruining\u00a0Napoleon Bonaparte&#8217;s plan of making a surprise attack on the\u00a0Po Valley\u00a0and\u00a0Turin. When he heard the news, he named the fort\u00a0<i><i lang=\"fr\" title=\"French-language text\">vilain castel de Bard<\/i><\/i>. Bonaparte then ordered the fort to be razed to the ground. It was not until 1830 that\u00a0Charles Albert of Savoy, fearing new attacks from the French, ordered that the fort be rebuilt. The task was entrusted to the famed Italian military engineer,\u00a0Francesco Antonio Olivero. The work, which took eight years to complete, created a fort with two distinct levels. The upper part had conventional battlements whereas the lower part had 50 gun ports in autonomous\u00a0casemates\u00a0that were designed to offer mutual protection if attacked. A total of 416 soldiers could now be billeted in the 283-room fort. The upper level had a courtyard that contained the arsenals and barracks. The fort had enough ammunition and food supplies for three months. By the end of the 19th century, the fort had lost its military value and fell into disuse.<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"w-100\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.marcopolo.tv\/960x480\/media\/post\/lgt5evp\/forte-di-bard.jpg\" alt=\"\/media\/post\/lgt5evp\/forte-di-bard.jpg\" \/><br \/>\nIt requires 3 separate ascensors to reach the top of the fort.

This is an\u00a0Italian\u00a0medieval\u00a0castle\u00a0located in the town of\u00a0F\u00e9nis. It is one of the most famous castles in\u00a0Aosta Valley, and for its architecture and its many towers and battlemented walls has become one of the major tourist attractions of the region. In 1242, it probably was a simple\u00a0keep\u00a0surrounded by walls. From 1320 to 1420, the castle was expanded to its actual appearance.<br \/>\nIn 1895 architect Alfredo d&#8217;Andrade purchased it and started a restoration campaign to secure the damaged structures. In 1935 a second campaign gave the castle its current appearance. The rooms were also provided with wood-period furniture.<br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"thumbimage\" src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/f\/f6\/Fenis1.JPG\/220px-Fenis1.JPG\" srcset=\"\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/f\/f6\/Fenis1.JPG\/330px-Fenis1.JPG 1.5x, \/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/f\/f6\/Fenis1.JPG\/440px-Fenis1.JPG 2x\" alt=\"\" width=\"623\" height=\"467\" data-file-width=\"1024\" data-file-height=\"768\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The keep has a\u00a0pentagonal\u00a0layout, with\u00a0towers\u00a0at the corners.

The land the park encompasses was initially protected to protect the\u00a0Alpine ibex\u00a0from poachers, as it was a personal hunting ground for King\u00a0Victor Emmanuel II, but now also protects other species.<br \/>\nHome to ibex and chamois, it has ski runs and a vast network of paths, including the trail from Pont Valsavarenche to Nivolet plateau, which passes a waterfall.

Established in 1989 to preserve the high valley of Torrente Chalamy; in 2003, a part of the great valley of Dondena was also included in the protected area, reaching up as far as the mountain ridges of the Val Soana and the Valle di Cogne. The Park stretches over\u00a05,747 hectares\u00a0and borders on the Parco Nazionale del Gran Paradiso.<br \/>\nYou can reach the site along the A5, coming off at Verr\u00e8s and taking the SS26 towards Aosta &#8211; then the Strada Regionale n\u00b06, via Fabbrica, as far as Champdepraz &#8211; and the local road to Chevr\u00e8re.

This is a\u00a0mountain range\u00a0in the\u00a0Alps, located mostly in\u00a0France\u00a0and\u00a0Italy, but also straddling\u00a0Switzerland\u00a0at its northeastern end. It contains eleven major independent summits, each over 4,000 metres (13,123\u00a0ft) in height. It is named after\u00a0Mont Blanc\u00a0(4,808 metres (15,774\u00a0ft)), the highest point in\u00a0western Europe\u00a0and the\u00a0European Union. Because of its considerable overall altitude, a large proportion of the\u00a0massif\u00a0is covered by\u00a0glaciers, which include the\u00a0Mer de Glace\u00a0and the\u00a0Miage Glacier\u00a0\u2013 the longest glaciers in France and Italy, respectively.<br \/>\nThe massif forms a\u00a0watershed\u00a0between the vast\u00a0catchments\u00a0of the rivers\u00a0Rh\u00f4ne\u00a0and\u00a0Po, and a\u00a0tripoint\u00a0between France, Italy and Switzerland; it also marks the border between two\u00a0climate regions\u00a0by separating the northern and western Alps from the southern Alps. The mountains of the massif consist mostly of\u00a0granite\u00a0and\u00a0gneiss\u00a0rocks and at high altitudes, the vegetation is an\u00a0arctic-alpine\u00a0flora.<br \/>\nThe valleys that delimit the massif were used as communication routes by the\u00a0Romans\u00a0until they left around the 5th\u00a0century AD. The region remained of some military importance through to the mid-20th\u00a0century. A peasant farming economy operated within these valleys for many centuries until the glaciers and mountains were &#8220;discovered&#8221; by the outside world in the 18th\u00a0century. Word of these impressive sights began to spread, and Mont Blanc was first climbed in 1786, marking the start of the sport of mountaineering. The region is now a major tourist destination, drawing in over six<span class=\"nowrap\">\u00a0<\/span>million visitors per year. It provides a wide range of opportunities for outdoor recreation and activities such as sightseeing,\u00a0hiking,\u00a0rock climbing,\u00a0mountaineering\u00a0and\u00a0skiing. Around one hundred people a year die across its mountains and, occasionally, bodies have been lost and entombed in its glaciers for decades.<br \/>\nAccess to the mountains is facilitated by cable cars, mountain railways, and mountain huts which offer overnight refuge to climbers and skiers. The long-distance Tour du Mont Blanc hiking trail circumnavigates the whole massif in an 11-day trek of 170 kilometres (110 mi). The Mont Blanc Tunnel connects the French town of Chamonix on the northern side with the Italian town of Courmayeur in the south. The high mountains have provided many opportunities for scientific research, including neutrino measurements within the tunnel and the impact of climate change on its highest slopes. Recent rises in average temperatures have led to significant glacial retreat across the massif and an awareness of the need for better environmental protection, including a call for World Heritage Site status.<br \/>\n<i><\/i><em>It was an approximately 125km drive back to Turin, the most mountainous.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Aosta August 9, 2021 This small province sits in its NW corner of Italy where France, Switzerland, and Italy meet at the Mount Blanc massif.
