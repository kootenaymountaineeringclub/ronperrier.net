The taco stand is ubiquitous. They would serve them on corn tortillas, spicy meat, thin piquant guacamole, salsa fresca and possibly some crema or lettuce.<br \/>\nI make 3 kinds: meat, vegetarian and fish.<br \/>\n<strong>Meat<\/strong>: saut\u00e9 1 lb hamburger or chicken with refried beans, break up all the chunks, 1 finely chopped onion, 2 cloves garlic minced. Add 1 package Old El Pas Taco Sauce and mix.<br \/>\n<strong>Vegetarian<\/strong>: Saut\u00e9 in olive oil: \u00bd c onion ch, 2 clove garlic, add 1 can refried beans or 2 cans drained black beans\/mashed, 2 tsp cumin, \u00bc c diced red pepper, green Tabasco or black pepper. Heat thoroughly.<br \/>\n<strong>Fish #1<\/strong>: Fillet of fish of your choice (rinse, pat dry, salt and pepper), cut in thin strips 3-4\u201d long. Beat 1 egg and mix with \u00be cup buttermilk. Soak fish in buttermilk for 30 minutes. Bread in: \u00be c white cornmeal seasoned with 1tsp salt, 1tsp pepper, 1tsp garlic powder, \u00bc tsp cayenne pepper. Saute crispy on all sides. Serve with cucumber, guacamole, pico de gallo and sour cream.<br \/>\n<strong>Fish #2:<\/strong> Prepare fish as above. Chipotle Crema: whisk together 1 c sour cream, 4 tsp half-and-half cream and 1 tsp adobo sauce (the sauce from canned chipotle peppers). Orange Avocado Salsa: Combine 3 oranges peeled diced and drained, 2 tbsp cilantro chopped, 2 tbsp jalapeno peppers seeded and finely diced, 2 tbsp red onion finely diced, 2 medium avocados diced into 1\/2&#8243; cubes and 3\/4 tsp salt and mix gently and set aside. Assembly with flour tortillas fish, crema, salsa and red cabbage very thinly shaved.<br \/>\n<em>Assembly:<\/em> Flour tortilla, protein source, thinly sliced English cucumber, guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream or crema, lettuce.<br \/>\n1. <strong>FRIJOLES<\/strong><br \/>\n2 c dried pinto beans covered in water by 2&#8243; and soak overnight. Rinse and drain, return to pot, add 1 onion halved and sliced, 1 clove garlic minced, 8 oz bacon diced, 1 guajillo chile toasted, stemmed and seeded + 1 chile de arbol stemmed and seeded. Add water to cover by 1&#8243;. Boil then simmer 2-3 hours till beans tender and most liquid evaporated. Salt. Sprinkle grated cheese.<br \/>\n2. <strong>REFRIED BEANS<\/strong><br \/>\nMelt 2 tbsp bacon drippings. Add 4 c frijoles, few at time mashing. Add 2-4 tsp cumin. Cook low until thick ~1 hour, stirring and adding water. Top with grated cheese and 1 tbsp chopped green onion.<br \/>\n3. <strong>GUACAMOLE<\/strong><br \/>\nMash 2 medium ripe avocados. Add 1 small tomato finely chopped, 1 jalapeno or serrano pepper minced, \u00bc cup finely diced onion, 2 tsp fresh cilantro, \u00bc tsp salt, juice of 2 limes. Mix.<br \/>\n4. <strong>SALSA FRESCA or PICO DE GALLO<\/strong><br \/>\nThey are virtually identical but Pico de Gallo is roughly chopped while Sausa Fresca is finely chopped.<br \/>\n<em>Pico de Gallo<\/em> is always raw diced white onion, tomatoes, chile &#8212;usually jalapenos or serranos, and cilantro. Season with salt and lemon or lime juice to taste. Pico de Gallo translates literally to rooster beak but means: to coarse chop like using a beak to do the job (instead of a knife)<br \/>\n<em>Salsa Fresca<\/em> is always minced raw chile, usually chili guerrito (yellow) or another mild to medium chilli, green onion, cilantro and cooled boiled water. Any other raw ingredients are to the cook&#8217;s fancy, such as tomato, white onion, multiple chili peppers, avocado, mango, bell pepper, etc. Season with salt to taste. Salsa Fresca translates and means fresh sauce (not cooked).<br \/>\n<em>Ingredients<\/em><br \/>\n1 1\/2 cups seeded, diced tomatoes<br \/>\n1\/2 cup diced white or yellow onion<br \/>\n1-3 minced Serrano or jalapeno peppers<br \/>\n1 tablespoon minced garlic<br \/>\nJuice of 2 limes<br \/>\n2 tablespoons cilantro, plus extra for garnish<br \/>\nSalt and pepper<\/p>\n<p><strong>BEEF TACOS II<\/strong><br \/>\nIn Mexico, the meat can be shredded pork but saucy beef (carne deshebrada) is more common even.<br \/>\nWhat meat? Options include chuck roast (5 h to tenderize, not as beefy), flank steak and skirt steak (not much marbling so tends to be dry). The best was beef short ribs (meaty and rich, cooked half the time, fatty so need to trim meat well initially and skim liquid). Cut into 2\u201d cubes. The meat will brown if not submerged in liquid. Raise on thick onion rounds to avoid the fuss of searing the meat.<br \/>\nCooking liquid? Swapped liquid with beer and cider vinegar. Blend the cooking liquid briefly.<br \/>\nChilis? If pureeing the sauce, can use dried chiles. Use a wide variety. Choices include moderately hot guajillos, mild New Mexican red, smoky anchos or earthy pasillas.<br \/>\nTopping choices included salsa, pico de gallo, guacamole and cheese<br \/>\nCurtido \u2013 a crunchy, tart, spicy slaw of cabbage and carrot<br \/>\n\u2022 1\u00bd c beer (Dos Equis)<br \/>\n\u2022 \u00bd c cider vinegar<br \/>\n\u2022 4 dried ancho chilis, stemmed, seeded and torn into \u00bd\u201d pieces<br \/>\n\u2022 2 tbsp tomato paste<br \/>\n\u2022 6 garlic cloves, crushed and peeled<br \/>\n\u2022 3 bay leaves<br \/>\n\u2022 2 tsp gr cumin<br \/>\n\u2022 2 tsp dried oregano<br \/>\n\u2022 \u00bd tsp gr cloves<br \/>\n\u2022 \u00bd tsp gr cinnamon<br \/>\n\u2022 1 large onion, slice \u00bd\u201d rounds<br \/>\n\u2022 3 lbs boneless beef short ribs, trimmed and cut 2\u201d cubes<br \/>\nOven low middle rack 325\u00b0. Combine beer, vinegar, anchos, tomato paste, garlic, bay leaves, cumin, oregano, 2 tsp salt, \u00bd tsp pepper, cloves and cinnamon in a Dutch oven. Arrange onion on the bottom of the pot and place beef on top. Cover and cook until beef is well-browned and tender 2\u00bd-3 hrs.<br \/>\n<strong>Cabbage-Carrot Slaw<\/strong><br \/>\nWhisk 1 c cider vinegar, \u00bd c water, 1 tbsp sugar, 1\u00bd tsp salt, 1 tsp dried oregano in bowl. Add 6 c green cabbage cored and sliced thin, 1 onion thin slice, 1 large carrot peeled and shredded, 1 jalapeno minced. Combine. Cover and refrigerate 1-24 hours. Drain and stir in 1 c cilantro ch.<br \/>\n<em>Finish.<\/em> Transfer beef to bowl, tent foil. Strain liquid, discard onion and bay leaves. Blend remaining solids. Settle liquid 5\u2019 the skim, then add water to make 1 cup. Add to blender then transfer to empty pot.<br \/>\nUsing 2 forks, shred beef, simmer sauce, stir in beef, season.<br \/>\nSpoon beef onto a warm tortilla and serve with slaw, queso fresco (feta) and lime wedges.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BEEF BURRITOS\u00a0<\/strong><br \/>\n1 pound ground beef, 1 medium onion, finely chopped, 2 cloves garlic, minced<br \/>\n1 tablespoon chili powder, 1 teaspoon cumin, 1 teaspoon paprika, 1 teaspoon oregano, 1\/2 teaspoon salt, 1\/2 teaspoon black pepper, 1\/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)<br \/>\n1\/2 cup beef broth, 1 tablespoon tomato paste<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">For the Burritos: <\/span>6 large flour tortillas (10-12 inches)<br \/>\n1 cup cooked Mexican rice, 1 cup refried beans or black beans, 1 cup shredded lettuce, 1 cup diced tomatoes, 1 cup shredded cheese (cheddar or Monterey Jack), 1\/2 cup salsa, 1\/2 cup sour cream, 1\/4 cup chopped cilantro, 1 avocado, sliced (optional)<\/p>\n<p><strong>SWEET POTATO TACOS<\/strong> Makes 6-8<br \/>\n2 lbs ground turkey or beef, 1 tsp salt, 1\/2 tsp black pepper, 1\/2 c finely ch onion, 1\/2 tbsp chili powder, 1 tsp gr cumin, 2 tsp gr coriander, 16 ounces tomato sauce, 1 jalape\u00f1o ch, 1\/3 cup water, 2 cups chopped fresh spinach, 2 &#8211; 15oz cans beans (black, pinto, white), rinsed and drained, 4 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and chopped small (1\/2-inch pieces)<br \/>\nGarnishes: shredded cheese, sour cream, avocados or guacamole, salsa, olives, cilantro<br \/>\nPreheat oven to 425. Saute medium ground meat, salt, pepper, and onion. Cook, breaking the meat into small pieces. Add the chili powder, cumin, coriander, tomato sauce and jalape\u00f1o. Cook medium for 2-3 minutes, stirring often. Add water, spinach and beans and simmer for 4-5 minutes.<br \/>\nLightly grease centre 6-8 foil pieces, each about 12 inches long. Place about 1 cup of sweet potato chunks in the centre of each piece of foil arranging them into somewhat of a single layer; sprinkle with salt and pepper (don&#8217;t skip this step!). Add a heaping 1\/2 cup or so of the meat mixture on top. Bring the long sides of foil together over the filling and fold tightly down. Fold and crimp each edge until tightly sealed and a little packet is formed. Repeat. Place on a large, rimmed baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes until the potatoes are tender. Carefully open the foil packets and serve with taco toppings and garnishes of your choice.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ENCHILADAS VERDES<\/strong><br \/>\nGreen sauces have the brighter taste of fresh green chiles and tangy tomatillos, moist tender chicken pieces, soft corn tortillas and melted cheese on top. Cooks relatively quickly compared to red sauces.<br \/>\nVegetables. Poblanos have mild to moderate heat and a deep, complex, herbal flavour. Charing reduces the tartness of the tomatillos and brings a new sweet richness to the poblanos. The easiest way to char tomatillos and chiles is with a broiler: toss with oil; tomatillos done whole, peppers halved. Char on tomatillos has good taste but chili skins taste bitter and need to be removed.<br \/>\nChop coarsely with a few pulses in a food processor. If need to thin, use chicken broth. Add some sugar and a little raw garlic.<br \/>\nChicken. White meat is much preferred as complements the sauce\u2019s flavour. Cook by poaching in chicken broth with some saut\u00e9ed onion, garlic, and cumin added.<br \/>\nCheese. Pepper jack (mild and spicy) is best. Add a handful of cilantro.<br \/>\nCorn tortillas. Traditionally dip in hot oil to make them pliable and to keep from breaking when rolled. Quicker and less messy to spray with vegetable oil and bake for a few minutes. Can also use normal tortillas. Six.<br \/>\n<em>Recipe:<\/em><br \/>\nOven rack 6\u201d from boiler, heat broiler.<br \/>\nSaut\u00e9 in 4 tsp vegetable oil, medium heat: 1 onion ch, 5-7 min.

Add 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts trimmed, cover and simmer till chicken 160\u00b0, 15-20 minutes. Flip the chicken halfway. Refrigerate 20 minutes till completely cool. Set aside \u00bc c poaching fluid.<br \/>\nLine a baking sheet with foil. Toss tomatillos and poblanos with 2 tsp oil. Broil till vegetables blackened and start to soften about 5-10 minutes, rotate half way through. Let cool, remove skins from poblanos. Reduce oven temp to 350\u00b0.<br \/>\nProcess vegetables and juices. Add 1 tsp sugar, 1 tsp salt, 1 clove garlic, \u00bc c reserved poaching liquid and pulse till chunky (8 pulses?). Season with salt, pepper and extra sugar to taste.<br \/>\nUsing 2 forks, shred the chicken into bite-sized pieces. Add 1\u00bd c shredded pepper jack and cilantro and mix. Season with salt.<br \/>\nAssembly. Spread \u00be c sauce over a 13&#215;9 baking dish. Arrange tortillas in a single layer on 2 baking sheets and spray both sides with oil spray. Bake till soft and pliable about 2-4 minutes. Increase oven temp to 450\u00b0.<br \/>\nSpread \u2153 c chicken filling on each warm tortilla. Roll each tightly and place seam side down. Pour sauce evenly and sprinkle with \u00bd c cheese.<br \/>\nBake on a lower rack for 15-20 minutes. Sprinkle with onions. Pass with radishes and sour cream separately.<br \/>\nNote &#8211; needs much more sauce (I used 2 poblanos and 8 tomatillos), more liquid inside.<\/p>\n<p><strong>VEGY ENCHILADAS\u00a0<\/strong><br \/>\nBlack beans, roasted corn, sweet chilli, yams, bell peppers, greens, mozza.<br \/>\nSauce: tomato sauce, chipotle sour cream, rice.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CHILI RELLENOS<\/strong><br \/>\n4 poblano peppers: char, cool, remove char, remove seeds.
