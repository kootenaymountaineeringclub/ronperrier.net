I slept here on the street across from a burger restaurant and used their wi-fi.<\/p>\n<p><strong>OSTROG MONASTERY<\/strong><br \/>\nActually in NM Montenegro South, it is only 20 road kilometres south of Nik\u0160i\u0107.. I picked a bad day to go here, Saturday, May 11, the day before the monastery celebrates its feast day on 12 May every year. St Basil died on 29 April in the Orthodox calendar which equates to 12 May in the Gregorian calendar.<br \/>\nI was passing young adults carrying daypacks and sleeping bags at least 6 km before the monastery and possibly passed 100. It is a big climb up here as the monastery sits at the base of a vertical cliff almost at the top of the mountain. Basically, there ended up being several thousand camped all over wherever there was a flat spot. It is necessary to park down below and walk up either the faster stairs or on the road with its long switchbacks. At the last switchback just before the monastery, bodies were everywhere.<br \/>\nI joined the line up to enter the monastery (don\u2019t enter the candle\/water line), at least 30 people across that narrowed in 40m to 4 across on the stairs. After an hour, I had moved about one metre and that was only by some aggressive movements. I talked to three 16-year-olds with faltering English who filled me in. Nobody in their religious devotion seemed to mind standing still. Finally, I decided to leave, it would have been 5-8 hours to finally get in. On leaving I talked to a woman from Switzerland who seemed OK with the situation. When I gave her my website address, she, for the first time ever, mentioned Laurent-Perrier champagne, a very high-end champagne that was her favourite (she looked like a high-maintenance woman). She asked a guard for me if I could go in the exit line (that nobody exited) for a 10-second look, but that was not possible.<br \/>\nI have seen innumerable orthodox churches and this would have probably been rather ordinary but with icons and a reliquary of St Basil that everyone would cross themselves 10 times, kiss and touch the floor in front of.<br \/>\nThe Monastery of Ostrog is a monastery of the Serbian Orthodox Church situated against an almost vertical background, high up in the large rock of Ostro\u0161ka Greda. It is dedicated to Saint Basil of Ostrog (Sveti Vasilije Ostro\u0161ki), who was buried here. From the monastery, a superb view of the Bjelopavli\u0107i plain can be seen. The monastery is 50\u00a0km from Podgorica and 15\u00a0km from Nik\u0161i\u0107. Ostrog monastery is the most popular pilgrimage place in Montenegro.<br \/>\nThe Monastery was founded by Vasilije, the Metropolitan Bishop of Herzegovina in the 17th century. He died there in 1671 and some years later he was glorified. His body is enshrined in a reliquary kept in the cave church dedicated to the Presentation of the Mother of God to the Temple.<br \/>\nThe present-day look was given to the Monastery in 1923-1926, after a fire that had destroyed a major part of the complex. The two little cave-churches were spared and they are the key areas of the monument. The frescoes in the Church of the Presentation were created towards the end of the 17th century. The other church, dedicated to the Holy Cross, is placed within a cave on the upper level of the monastery and was painted by Master Radul, who successfully coped with the natural shapes of the cave and laid the frescoes immediately on the surface of the rock and the south wall. Around the church are the monastic residences, which together with the church building and the scenery make this monument outstandingly beautiful.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.montenegropulse.com\/ostrog.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwi7-cHUyJziAhVMzaQKHTzKAuMQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/www.montenegropulse.com\/images\/Ostrog-Monastery.jpg\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"599\" height=\"398\" data-iml=\"1557890051546\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>During World War II, a detachment of Chetniks took refuge at Ostrog up to October 18, 1943, when Yugoslav Partisans promised the Chetniks that their lives would be spared if they surrendered. The 23 Chetniks peacefully surrendered, expecting to be spared, but were all killed by the Partisans at Ostrog. Stani\u0161i\u0107 and three members of his extended family initially did not surrender but did not survive at Ostrog.<br \/>\nThe Orthodox monastery of Ostrog is one of the most frequently visited in the Balkans. It attracts over 100,000 visitors a year. It is visited by believers from all parts of the world. It represents the meeting place of all confessions: the Orthodox, the Catholics and the Muslims. According to the stories of pilgrims, by praying to his body, many have been cured and helped in lessening the difficulties in their lives.<br \/>\n<strong>Upper Monastery.<\/strong> The upper monastery houses the Church of the Presentation and the Church of the Holy Cross. Saint Basil of Ostrog&#8217;s relics lie in the Church of the Presentation. Also of interest is the vine which grows out of the rock. It&#8217;s said that it&#8217;s a miracle because nothing should be able to grow out of the sheer rock face.<br \/>\n<strong>Lower Monastery<\/strong>. The lower monastery centers around the Church of the Holy Trinity which was built in 1824. It also makes up most of the monk&#8217;s residences. There are dorm rooms available for pilgrims here too.<br \/>\n<strong>Traditions.<\/strong> It is traditional for pilgrims to walk the 3\u00a0km from the lower monastery to the upper monastery barefoot. Before entering the Church of the Presentation to pray before Saint Basil of Ostrog, pilgrims make a donation of clothing, blankets or consumables like soap for the monks. The monastery celebrates its feast day on 12 May every year. St Basil died on 29 April in the Orthodox calendar which equates to 12 May in the Gregorian calendar.<br \/>\nIn many respects, it was an enlightening experience even if I did not get to go into the church. The vast majority of the people here were less than 25, unusual to see such religious devotion in so many of this age anywhere in the world. But religious \u2018penetration\u2019 is deep here with few acknowledged atheists. Just like in India of Pakistan, it does not work well to be a non-believer. On the other hand, it could have been just a chance to camp out on a weekend and be with your friends. The vast majority had one fleece blanket and few tents. It would have been havoc if it rained.<br \/>\n<em>Instead of returning on the same road, I took the exit road to the south towards Podgorica and drove 40 kilometres longer to get back to Niksic.
