They go out of their way to explore a country&#8217;s cuisine. They research famous restaurants, know the street food scene and often will try anything \u2013 insects, maggots, cuy in Peru, dog, cat, snake or whatever must be tried for the experience. That\u2019s not me. \u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br \/>\nI am not a foodie. Food doesn\u2019t usually play a big role in my travel. I generally don\u2019t experiment and like to know what I&#8217;m ordering. A menu with only pictures is too much of an adventure for me. But I do like flavourful piquant food.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br \/>\nFood is one element of travel where enormous savings can be had. <\/span>Buying food in supermarkets is cheapest and best quality. I travel with a cup, bowl, spoon, instant coffee, and sugar, and buy milk daily<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">. I virtually always travel with breakfast. Granola or <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">processed cereals with added nuts and fruit <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">are available everywhere.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I purchased a Volkswagen California and drove 200,000 km around Europe and western Asia in 2017 and 2028, It is an expensive but deluxe vehicle with a stove and fridge. I ate in the van 98% of the time. The German supermarkets, Lidl and Aldi are everywhere in Europe and inexpensive. I ate much healthier food than in restaurants including a large salad every night. Europe was my cheapest destination.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><br \/>\nCoffee<\/strong>. This is something I always travel with. Instant may not be the best but it has caffeine. Other types are not practical. I drink mine with sugar and milk. The sugar is easy to carry and I buy milk whenever I arrive at a destination, also necessary for cereal.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I am always astonished at the price of Starbucks coffee irrelevant to the country&#8217;s wealth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Street food<\/strong> is often a country\u2019s tastiest cuisine. Some countries have wonderful street food \u2013 Mexico, Pakistan, and South Korea come to mind. When I travelled for three\u00a0<\/span>months in Mexico in my camper, even though it had a complete kitchen, I virtually only ate street food. American Tex-Mex is not real Mexican food. Street food is invariably fresh and safe, especially at stands with a crowd.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>American Fast Food.<\/strong> You know exactly what you are going to get. No surprises. I am a world authority on hamburgers and most fast food is centred on hamburgers or chicken. Hamburgers must be the commonest food in the world. They are available anywhere. Countries outside North America have it all wrong \u2013 too much bun, buns that disintegrate, no onion, pickles, mustard, tomato, and sometimes no mayonnaise. Burger sauce, a mixture of mayo and ketchup is best. They add crazy things like egg, cucumber and beetroot. Hamburgers are meant to be juicy and this requires fat in the meat. Using extra lean or expensive meat like Japanese wagyu is too dry. A good regular hamburger with no filler and a healthy sprinkling of salt and pepper is best. Onion and pickles are mandatory. A large browned piece of green chilli adds flavour. Bacon makes anything taste good. And there should be French fries \u2013 served with mayonnaise. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Do you know what the most popular restaurant is in France and Italy? These two nations are renowned for their cuisine but usually too expensive to eat regularly in restaurants. I routinely see lineups in the double drive-throughs 40 cars deep at McDonald&#8217;s in both those countries. McDonald&#8217;s is the rock bottom of American fast food. They have newer premier burgers that are passable. But their fries are atrocious and just pass when fresh \u2013 they get stale fast. This attests to the fact that Europeans don\u2019t know hamburgers. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Burger King, Hardees and Wendy\u2019s are about equal. In Canada, A&amp;W is better than them all. They all have good crispy fries. Subway has more stores than McDonald&#8217;s.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Other Cuisines.<\/strong> Indian, Greek, South Asian and Middle East food is invariably good, but is often better outside those countries, all with a large diaspora. It is hard to beat meat in Argentina.<br \/>\nThe best pizza, another almost universal food, is not in Italy (where I never had great pizza). I like a thin crispy crust, a well-flavoured sauce and buffalo mozzarella. The best I have ever had was in Phenom Phen in Cambodia and at a hostel in north New Zealand. American pizza is not great. Pizza Hut is atrocious and invariably expensive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Restaurants<\/strong> are best avoided. You pay a lot for the d\u00e9cor, atmosphere and service. Most are expensive per calorie, an issue with the low-end traveller.\u00a0The food is rarely worth the cost; I can&#8217;t imagine paying the enormous prices at Michelin-starred restaurants.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">If you would like to get food poisoning, your best bet would be at restaurants, especially with a low turnover. Chicken is usually the culprit.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>\u2022<\/strong> Texas March 2008. After eating street food safely in Mexico for 3 months, I crossed the border at Del Rio Texas to treat myself at a Pizza Hut. Six hours later, I vomited 18 times. Classic food poisoning results from an exotoxin produced by Staphylococcus aureus, a bacteria that grows best in dated chicken. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>\u2022<\/strong> China. I have the most difficulty in China. I like Chinese food in Canada but that is usually Cantonese and not common in China. I dislike ordering from pictures, bone in the chicken, and the flavours. My Chinese girlfriend doesn\u2019t even like Chinese food in restaurants.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Some travel for the food experience.
