Every bend in the road has great views of mountains, ridges and many lakes.<br \/>\nHistory. Settled in 3000 BC, it was variously inhabited by Celts, Angles, Vikings and Romans. In the Dark Ages, it was the centre of the ancient kingdom of Rheged. In the Middle Ages, the area was the start of the \u2018Debatable Lands\u2019, the wild border between England and Scotland. Bands of raiders known as Border Reivers, regularly plundered the area, prompting the construction of defensive <em>pele<\/em> towers and castles in Carlisle, Penrith and Kendal.<br \/>\nThe area became the centre of the Romantic movement during the 19<sup>th<\/sup> century largely thanks to the Cumbrian-born poet William Wordsworth. He also championed the protection of the Lake District from overdevelopment. The park was formed in 1951.<br \/>\nThe present-day county of Cumbria was formed from the neighbouring districts of Cumberland and Westmorland in 1974.<br \/>\nMany people visit to connect with the many writers who found inspiration here: Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Arthur Ransome and Beatrix Potter.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lake District NP<\/strong> is by far England\u2019s most popular national park with its craggy hills, mountain tarns and multiple lakes. The main visitor centre for the park is at Brockhole just outside Windermere.<br \/>\nVisit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nationaltrust.org.uk\/features\/camping-in-the-lake-district\">www.nationaltrust.org.uk\/features\/camping-in-the-lake-district<\/a> to make reservations for all the National Trust campsites in the Lake District.<br \/>\nHiking. There are at least 200 recognized hikes in the Lake District. Here are the top five:<br \/>\n1. Scafell Pike (978m). England\u2019s highest peak. With at least 5 routes, the classic is from a parking area\/campground just before the village of Wasdale Head. Takes 4-6 hours. Often done in conjunction with the highest peak in Scotland (Ben Nevis) and Wales (Snowdon) sometimes in one long day.<br \/>\n2. Helvellyn (950m). A vertiginous scramble along the knife-edge ridge of Striding Edge. 6 hours starting from Glenridding or Patterdale.<br \/>\n3. Blencathra (868m). Panoramic outlook on Keswick and the northern fells. 4 hours from Threlkeld.<br \/>\n4. Haystacks (597m). A 2-3 hour hike from near Buttermere Village.<br \/>\n5. Catbells (451m). An easy walk on the west side of Derwentwater \u2013 2 hours.<\/p>\n<p><strong>WINDERMERE<\/strong> (pop 5400)<br \/>\nWindermere Lake at 10.5 miles long and a mile wide at its widest, is the largest body of water anywhere in England. Its maximum depth is 220m. It\u2019s been the centre for tourism since the first trains arrived in 1857. The town of Windermere is split in two \u2013 <strong>Bowness<\/strong> is on the eastern shore and <strong>Windermere Town<\/strong> is 1.5 miles inland at the top of the hill.<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597 iMGxgrW_JfDg-zixyDjKkw5M\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hfholidays.co.uk\/holidays-and-tours\/lake-windermere\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwiV8YLL1rHaAhXIPhQKHW_wAl0QjRx6BAgAEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/www.hfholidays.co.uk\/media\/cache\/2d\/bc\/2dbcf92682d909b10948e3158fde37a3.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for windermere\" width=\"671\" height=\"224\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nThere are 18 islands on Windermere.

The route follows a rough hiker-made trail and crosses ground I have never experienced before \u2013 wet bog that was like walking on a giant sponge.
