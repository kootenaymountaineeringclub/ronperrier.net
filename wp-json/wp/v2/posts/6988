Climb steadily for 40 minutes in forest, then pass large, embedded boulders and enter the subalpine and good views. The trail fades some in the gravel and grass but tops out on a saddle on Gimli Peak&#8217;s southern outlier. Local climbers call this sandy camping area &#8220;the Beach&#8221; with a stone wind block, food cache and green plastic toilet on the west slope.

Clamber over stone blocks covered with black-and-green lichen. Near the top of the talus, a sketchy trail reappears switchbacking tightly as it approaches Gimli&#8217;s sheer SW face. The path ends after a grassy bench to continue over chunky boulders and reach the ridge immediately west of Gimli Peak 2525m (8250&#8242;) and the Gimly\/Niselheim Col.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> More than 305m (1000 feet) below you to the north and northeast are the Mulvey Basin lakes.

It ends on a very steep snow slope that is a glacier with exposed ice late in the season. An ice axe is recommended at any time and crampons are necessary most of the year but especially in August and September. After the short steep descent, then angle left across the snow to gain gravel and rock to descend into the basin.<br \/>\nif you don&#8217;t have crampons or an axe, cut across the base of Niselheim to the Niselheim\/Midgard col and descend the easy slopes into the basin.<br \/>\n<strong>Climb Gimli.<\/strong> A technical rock climb by all routes but the NE ridge which is class 4. To access the NE ridge, scramble the short 10&#8242; high bit to access the slope that leads to the ridge. Don&#8217;t bother crossing to a cleft that gives access to the slope. If you have trouble with this short scramble, then climbing the NE ridge may be too much for you.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>GIMLY RIDGE\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666 Mulvey Basin is the premier climbing area of the West Kootenay &#8211; big granite walls surrounding a lake-filled basin.
