Many Kootenay towns were originally mining settlements. The rush to Sandon began in September 1891 with the Payne mine. Within a year, 750 mining claims covered the mountainsides above Carpenter Creek. Within 2 years, Sandon&#8217;s population soared to 5,000. Three Forks comprised 240 lots. Within 5 years, the Kaslo and Sandon (K &amp; S) Railway and CPR&#8217;s Nakusp and Slocan (N &amp; S) Railway were serving the mines.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Silvery Slocan mining district became famous for galena, an ore rich in silver, lead and zinc. Some of it, called &#8220;float,&#8221; was found above ground. The rest was mined from hard-rock veins.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"sFlh5c FyHeAf\" src=\"https:\/\/encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTUkuYEN40a6L6rnQvJvXRORTqTIguMp0T34w&amp;s\" alt=\"Sandon and the Kaslo &amp; Slocan Railway.

Sandon was devastated by a fire in 1900 but was soon rebuilt. The mining industry fizzled after 1910.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The town was washed out by Carpenter Creek in 1933 and again in 1955. Today, Sandon comprises only a few buildings. No trace of Three Forks remains.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The K&amp;S Railway Trail can be done in many ways.
