The park is situated in the Selkirk Mountains, between large lakes, the Slocan and Kootenay lakes at the south end, and between Arrow Lakes and Duncan Lake at the north end. <span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">West of the Goat Range Provincial Park is Hamling Lakes Wildlife Management Area. It encompasses a wide range of ecosystems, from lush\u00a0<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">interior wet belt old growth\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">valley bottom to open alpine with sparkling lakes, untamed rivers and fast flowing creeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> The park protects the only natural spawning site of the unique \u201cGerrard\u201d rainbow trout. This wilderness area is critical in maintaining the natural habitat for species such as grizzly bear, mountain goat and mountain caribou. Visitors are asked to employ low impact techniques.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It serves partly as a conservancy for the grizzly bear, and roads and trails into the park will be allowed to deteriorate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">NATURE &amp; CULTURE<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong> History:<\/strong>\u00a0The park has an important mining and logging history including a historic townsite and railway station, although no trace of these remain.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The area was originally proposed for protection under the name of White Grizzly, by the Valhalla Society in the mid-1980s. Wayne McCrory, a bear biologist, was an especially strong advocate for this issue, as was his sister Colleen McCrory. Wayne, based in nearby New Denver, had undertaken some of the original grizzly research in the area and had been the first person to inform the public about the existence of the uniquely coloured race of bears found in the Goat Range. Subsequently, following the suggestions of citizens involved in the West Kootenay Commission on Resources and the Environment (CORE) negotiations, Goat Range Provincial Park was recommended for protection in 1995. Shortly thereafter the area was formally designated a Class A park by the BC government.<br \/>\n<\/span><strong style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Cultural Heritage:<\/strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> The area within the park is significant to the Okanagan, Shuswap and Ktunaxa-Kinbasket First Nations.\u00a0The park has an important mining and logging history including a historic townsite and railway terminus at the south end of Trout Lake.<br \/>\n<\/span><strong style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Conservation:<\/strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The park contains old-growth forests, extensive alpine meadows and lakes, and numerous rivers and creeks.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">It protects a mix of low, mid and high-elevation forests including mid to high-elevation wet belt forests. The park&#8217;s Interior Cedar Hemlock forests, with their heavy underbrush and abundance of ferns and shrubs, are particularly interesting, as they are very reminiscent of the coastal rainforest. At the highest elevations, there are expansive alpine meadows.<br \/>\nIt provides a spawning and rearing habitat for the internationally important Gerrard rainbow trout and an important spawning channel for Kootenay Lake and Kokanee in the Meadow Creek watershed. Flowers, trees and shrubs are part of the park\u2019s natural heritage, please do not damage or remove them.<br \/>\n<\/span><strong style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Wildlife:<\/strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">\u00a0Goat Range Park is an important area because it contains critical habitat for several species of large mammals. The park is home to a unique variety of grizzly bears, which\u00a0exhibit a distinctly white coloration to their fur. The Goat Range is the only place in BC where grizzlies with this unusual coloration are found. Elk, mountain goat and woodland caribou all depend on the park&#8217;s habitat to ensure their survival.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>ACTIVITIES<\/strong>\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong> Bicycling.<\/strong>\u00a0Bicycles must keep to roadways.

These important habitats are closed for fishing due to conservation reasons. Anyone fishing or angling in British Columbia must have an appropriate license. The use of motorized boats and other motorized watercraft is prohibited along that portion of the Lardeau River contained within Goat Range Park &#8211; from the outlet of the Lardeau River on Trout Lake at Gerrard to the park boundary approximately 14 km downstream near the confluence of Poplar Creek.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong> Hiking.\u00a0<\/strong>This park has some rugged possibilities but few developed trails. There is one short but awesome old-growth cedar walking trail and one short hike to a spectacular waterfall. Goat Range Provincial Park is an excellent place for backcountry hiking. While there are no facilities in the park, there are plenty of beautiful opportunities for backcountry camping. The excellent subalpine flower meadows and vistas into the Selkirk Mountains make the high-altitude hiking in the park particularly stunning.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong> Pets<\/strong>\/domestic animals must be on a leash at all times. You are responsible for their behaviour and must dispose of their excrement. Backcountry areas are not suitable for dogs or other pets due to wildlife issues and the potential for problems with bears.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong> Facilities<\/strong> Available at this Park. Walk-in, Backcountry, and Wilderness Camping are provided, but no facilities are provided. There are no user fees charged at this time.
