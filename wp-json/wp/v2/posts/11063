Athens dominates the\u00a0Attica\u00a0region and is one of the\u00a0world&#8217;s oldest cities, with its\u00a0recorded history\u00a0spanning over 3,400 years\u00a0and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennium BC.<br \/>\nClassical Athens\u00a0was a powerful\u00a0city-state\u00a0that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of\u00a0Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A center for\u00a0the arts, learning and\u00a0philosophy, home of\u00a0Plato&#8217;s\u00a0Academy\u00a0and\u00a0Aristotle&#8217;s\u00a0Lyceum,\u00a0it is widely referred to as the\u00a0cradle\u00a0of\u00a0Western civilization\u00a0and the\u00a0birthplace of democracy,\u00a0largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular\u00a0the Romans.\u00a0In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan\u00a0metropolis\u00a0and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2012, Athens was ranked the world&#8217;s\u00a039th richest city\u00a0by purchasing power\u00a0and the 67th most expensive\u00a0in a\u00a0UBS\u00a0study.<\/p>\n<p>Athens is a\u00a0global city\u00a0and one of the biggest economic centres in\u00a0southeastern Europe. It has a large financial sector, and its port\u00a0Piraeus\u00a0is both the largest passenger port in Europe,\u00a0and the second largest in the world.\u00a0while at the same time being the sixth busiest passenger port in Europe.\u00a0The\u00a0Municipality of Athens\u00a0(also\u00a0City of Athens) had a population of 664,046 (in 2011)\u00a0within its administrative limits, and a land area of 38.96\u00a0km2.\u00a0The urban area of Athens (Greater Athens and Greater Piraeus) extends beyond its administrative municipal\u00a0city limits, with a population of 3,090,508 (in 2011)\u00a0over an area of 412\u00a0km2\u00a0(159\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).\u00a0According to\u00a0Eurostat\u00a0in 2011, the\u00a0functional urban area\u00a0(FUA) of Athens was the 9th most populous FUA in the\u00a0European Union\u00a0(the 6th most populous capital city of the EU), with a population of 3.8 million people. Athens is also the southernmost capital on the European mainland.<br \/>\nThe heritage of the\u00a0classical era\u00a0is still evident in the city, represented by\u00a0ancient monuments\u00a0and works of art, the most famous of all being the\u00a0Parthenon, considered a key landmark of early\u00a0Western civilization. The city also retains\u00a0Roman\u00a0and\u00a0Byzantine monuments, as well as a smaller number of\u00a0Ottoman\u00a0monuments. Athens is home to two\u00a0UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the\u00a0Acropolis of Athens\u00a0and the medieval\u00a0Daphni Monastery. Landmarks of the modern era, dating back to the establishment of Athens as the capital of the independent Greek state in 1834, include the\u00a0Hellenic Parliament\u00a0and the so-called &#8220;architectural trilogy of Athens&#8221;, consisting of the\u00a0National Library of Greece, the\u00a0National and Kapodistrian University of Athens\u00a0and the\u00a0Academy of Athens. Athens is also home to several museums and cultural institutions, such as the\u00a0National Archeological Museum, featuring the world&#8217;s largest collection of ancient Greek antiquities, the\u00a0Acropolis Museum, the\u00a0Museum of Cycladic Art, the\u00a0Benaki Museum\u00a0and the\u00a0Byzantine and Christian Museum.<br \/>\nAthens was the host city of the\u00a0first modern-day Olympic Games in 1896, and 108 years later it welcomed home the\u00a02004 Summer Olympics, making it one of only a handful of cities to have hosted the Olympics more than once.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Etymology.<\/strong> In\u00a0Ancient Greek, the name of the city was Ath\u00eanai) a plural. The root of the word is probably not of Greek or\u00a0Indo-European\u00a0origin,\u00a0and is possibly a remnant of the\u00a0Pre-Greek substrate\u00a0of Attica. In antiquity, it was debated whether Athens took its name from its patron goddess\u00a0Athena or Athena took her name from the city.\u00a0Modern scholars now generally agree that the goddess takes her name from the city,\u00a0because the ending -ene\u00a0is common in names of locations, but rare for personal names.\u00a0During the medieval period, the name of the city was rendered once again in the singular. However, after the establishment of the modern Greek state, and partly due to the conservatism of the written language, Athens\u00a0became again the official name of the city and remained so until the abandonment of\u00a0Katharevousa\u00a0in the 1970s,\u00a0Ath\u00edna, became the official name.<br \/>\nAccording to the ancient Athenian\u00a0founding myth, Athena, the goddess of wisdom, competed against\u00a0Poseidon, the god of the seas, for patronage of the yet-unnamed city;\u00a0they agreed that whoever gave the Athenians the better gift would become their patron\u00a0and appointed\u00a0Cecrops, the king of Athens, as the judge.\u00a0According to the account given by\u00a0Pseudo-Apollodorus, Poseidon struck the ground with his\u00a0trident\u00a0and a salt water spring welled up.\u00a0In an alternative version of the myth from\u00a0Vergil&#8217;s\u00a0Georgics, Poseidon instead gave the Athenians the first horse.\u00a0In both versions, Athena offered the Athenians the first domesticated\u00a0olive tree.\u00a0Cecrops accepted this gift\u00a0and declared Athena the patron goddess of Athens.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HISTORY<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Prehistoy.<\/strong> The oldest known human presence in Athens is the Cave of Schist, which has been dated to between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Athens has been continuously inhabited for at least 7,000 years.\u00a0By 1400\u00a0BC the settlement had become an important centre of the\u00a0Mycenaean\u00a0civilization and the Acropolis was the site of a major\u00a0Mycenaean\u00a0fortress, whose remains can be recognised from sections of the characteristic\u00a0Cyclopean\u00a0walls.\u00a0Unlike other Mycenaean centers, such as\u00a0Mycenae\u00a0and\u00a0Pylos, it is not known whether Athens suffered destruction in about 1200\u00a0BC, an event often attributed to a\u00a0Dorian\u00a0invasion, and the Athenians always maintained that they were pure\u00a0Ionians\u00a0with no Dorian element. However, Athens,\u00a0like many other Bronze Age settlements, went into economic decline for around 150 years afterwards.<br \/>\nIron Age\u00a0burials, in the\u00a0Kerameikos\u00a0and other locations, are often richly provided for and demonstrate that from 900\u00a0BC onwards Athens was one of the leading centres of trade and prosperity in the region.\u00a0The leading position of Athens may well have resulted from its central location in the Greek world, its secure stronghold on the Acropolis and its access to the sea, which gave it a natural advantage over inland rivals such as\u00a0Thebes\u00a0and\u00a0Sparta.<br \/>\n<strong>Classical.<\/strong> By the 6th century BC, widespread social unrest led to the reforms of\u00a0Solon. These would pave the way for the eventual introduction of democracy by\u00a0Cleisthenes\u00a0in 508\u00a0BC. Athens had by this time become a significant naval power with a large fleet, and helped the\u00a0rebellion of the Ionian cities\u00a0against\u00a0Persian\u00a0rule. In the ensuing\u00a0Greco-Persian Wars\u00a0Athens, together with Sparta, led the coalition of Greek states that would eventually repel the Persians, defeating them decisively at\u00a0Marathon\u00a0in 490\u00a0BC, and crucially at\u00a0Salamis\u00a0in 480\u00a0BC. However, this did not prevent Athens from being\u00a0captured and sacked twice\u00a0by the\u00a0Persians\u00a0within one year, after a heroic but ultimately failed resistance at\u00a0Thermopylae\u00a0by\u00a0Spartans\u00a0and other Greeks led by\u00a0King Leonidas,\u00a0after both\u00a0Boeotia\u00a0and\u00a0Attica\u00a0fell to the Persians.<br \/>\n<strong>Golden Age.<\/strong> The decades that followed became known as the\u00a0Golden Age of Athenian democracy, during which time Athens became the leading city of\u00a0Ancient Greece, with its cultural achievements laying the foundations for\u00a0Western civilization. The playwrights\u00a0Aeschylus,\u00a0Sophocles\u00a0and\u00a0Euripides\u00a0flourished in Athens during this time, as did the historians\u00a0Herodotus\u00a0and\u00a0Thucydides, the physician\u00a0Hippocrates, and the philosopher\u00a0Socrates. Guided by\u00a0Pericles, who promoted the arts and fostered democracy, Athens embarked on an ambitious building program that saw the construction of the Acropolis of Athens (including the\u00a0Parthenon), as well as empire-building via the\u00a0Delian League. Originally intended as an association of Greek city-states to continue the fight against the Persians, the league soon turned into a vehicle for Athens&#8217;s own imperial ambitions. The resulting tensions brought about the\u00a0Peloponnesian War\u00a0(431\u2013404\u00a0BC), in which Athens was defeated by its rival\u00a0Sparta.<br \/>\nBy the mid-4th century BC, the northern Greek kingdom of\u00a0Macedon\u00a0was becoming dominant in Athenian affairs. In 338\u00a0BC the armies of\u00a0Philip II\u00a0defeated an alliance of some of the Greek city-states including Athens and Thebes at the Battle of Chaeronea, effectively ending Athenian independence. Later, under Rome, Athens was given the status of a\u00a0free city\u00a0because of its widely admired schools. The Roman emperor\u00a0Hadrian, in the 2nd century CE, constructed a library, a gymnasium, an aqueduct which is still in use, several temples and sanctuaries, a bridge and financed the completion of the\u00a0Temple of Olympian Zeus.<br \/>\nBy the end of\u00a0Late Antiquity, the city experienced decline followed by recovery in the second half of the Middle Byzantine Period, in the 9th to 10th centuries CE, and was relatively prosperous during the\u00a0Crusades, benefiting from Italian trade. After the\u00a0Fourth Crusade\u00a0the\u00a0Duchy of Athens\u00a0was established. In 1458 it was conquered by the\u00a0Ottoman Empire\u00a0and entered a long period of decline.<br \/>\nFollowing the\u00a0Greek War of Independence\u00a0and the establishment of the\u00a0Greek Kingdom, Athens was chosen as the capital of the newly independent Greek state in 1834, largely because of historical and sentimental reasons. At the time, it was reduced to a town of about 4,000 people in a loose swarm of houses along the foot of the Acropolis. The first\u00a0King of Greece, Otto of Bavaria, commissioned the architects\u00a0Stamatios Kleanthis\u00a0and\u00a0Eduard Schaubert\u00a0to design a modern city plan fit for the capital of a state.<br \/>\nThe first modern city plan consisted of a triangle defined by the\u00a0Acropolis, the ancient cemetery of\u00a0Kerameikos\u00a0and the new palace of the Bavarian king (now housing the\u00a0Greek Parliament), so as to highlight the continuity between modern and ancient Athens. Neoclassicism, the international style of this epoch, was the architectural style through which Bavarian, French and Greek architects such as Hansen, Klenze, Boulanger or Kaftantzoglou designed the first important public buildings of the new capital. In 1896, Athens hosted the first modern\u00a0Olympic Games. During the 1920s a number of\u00a0Greek refugees, expelled from\u00a0Asia Minor\u00a0after the\u00a0Greco-Turkish War, swelled Athens&#8217;s population; nevertheless it was most particularly following World War II, and from the 1950s and 1960s, that the population of the city exploded, and Athens experienced a gradual expansion.<br \/>\nIn the 1980s it became evident that smog from factories and an ever-increasing fleet of automobiles, as well as a lack of adequate free space due to congestion, had evolved into the city&#8217;s most important challenge. A series of anti-pollution measures taken by the city&#8217;s authorities in the 1990s, combined with a substantial improvement of the city&#8217;s infrastructure (including the\u00a0Attiki Odos\u00a0motorway, the expansion of the\u00a0Athens Metro, and the new\u00a0Athens International Airport), considerably alleviated pollution and transformed Athens into a much more functional city. In 2004 Athens hosted the\u00a02004 Summer Olympics.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GEOGRAPHY<\/strong><br \/>\nAthens sprawls across the central plain of\u00a0Attica\u00a0that is often referred to as the\u00a0Athens or Attica Basin. The basin is bounded by four large mountains:\u00a0Mount Aigaleo\u00a0to the west, Mount\u00a0Parnitha\u00a0to the north,\u00a0Mount Pentelicus\u00a0to the northeast and Mount\u00a0Hymettus\u00a0to the east.\u00a0Beyond Mount Aegaleo lies the\u00a0Thriasian plain, which forms an extension of the central plain to the west. The\u00a0Saronic Gulf\u00a0lies to the southwest. Mount Parnitha is the tallest of the four mountains (1,413\u00a0m (4,636\u00a0ft)\u00a0and has been declared a\u00a0national park.<br \/>\nAthens is built around a number of hills.\u00a0Lycabettus\u00a0is one of the tallest hills of the city proper and provides a view of the entire Attica Basin. The meteorology of Athens is deemed to be one of the most complex in the world because its mountains cause a\u00a0temperature inversion\u00a0phenomenon which, along with the Greek Government&#8217;s difficulties controlling industrial pollution, was responsible for the air pollution problems the city has faced.\u00a0This issue is not unique to Athens; for instance, Los Angeles and\u00a0Mexico City\u00a0also suffer from similar atmospheric inversion problems.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Cephissus\u00a0river, the\u00a0Ilisos\u00a0and the\u00a0Eridanos\u00a0stream are the historical rivers of Athens.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ENVIRONMENT<br \/>\n<\/strong>By the late 1970s, the pollution of Athens had become so destructive that according to the then Greek\u00a0Minister of Culture, Constantine Trypanis, &#8220;&#8230;the carved details on the five the caryatids of the Erechtheum had seriously degenerated, while the face of the horseman on the Parthenon&#8217;s west side was all but obliterated.&#8221;\u00a0A series of measures taken by the authorities of the city throughout the 1990s resulted in the improvement of air quality; the appearance of smog (or\u00a0nefos\u00a0as the Athenians used to call it) has become less common.<br \/>\nMeasures taken by the Greek authorities throughout the 1990s have improved the quality of air over the Attica Basin. Nevertheless, air pollution still remains an issue for Athens, particularly during the hottest summer days. In late June 2007,\u00a0the\u00a0Attica\u00a0region experienced a number of\u00a0brush fires,\u00a0including a blaze that burned a significant portion of a large forested national park in\u00a0Mount Parnitha,\u00a0considered critical to maintaining a better air quality in Athens all year round.\u00a0Damage to the park has led to worries over a stalling in the improvement of air quality in the city.<br \/>\nThe major waste management efforts undertaken in the last decade (particularly the plant built on the small island of Psytalia) have improved\u00a0water quality\u00a0in the Saronic Gulf, and the coastal waters of Athens are now accessible again to swimmers. In January 2007, Athens faced a waste management problem when its\u00a0landfill\u00a0near\u00a0Ano Liosia, an Athenian suburb, reached capacity.\u00a0The crisis eased by mid-January when authorities began taking the garbage to a temporary landfill.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CLIMATE<br \/>\n<\/strong>Athens has a hot-summer\u00a0Mediterranean climate. The dominant feature of Athens\u2019 climate is alternation between prolonged hot and dry summers and mild winters with moderate rainfall.\u00a0With an average of 416.8 millimetres (16.41\u00a0in) of yearly precipitation, rainfall occurs largely between the months of October and April. July and August are the driest months, when thunderstorms occur sparsely once or twice a month.<br \/>\nThe capital of\u00a0Greece\u00a0is sometimes considered the hottest city in\u00a0Europe\u00a0(considering the annual average temperature and not the records surpassed in the ranking by the south coast of\u00a0Spain) and also the driest city.<br \/>\nOwing to the\u00a0rain shadow\u00a0of the Pindus Mountains, annual precipitation of Athens is lower than most other parts of Greece, especially western Greece. As an example,\u00a0Ioannina receives around 1,300\u00a0mm (51\u00a0in) per year, and\u00a0Agrinio\u00a0around 800\u00a0mm (31\u00a0in) per year. Daily average highs for July (1988\u20132017) have been measured at 34.4\u00a0\u00b0C or 93.9\u00a0\u00b0F, but some parts of the city may be even hotter, in particular western areas due to a combination of industrialization and a number of natural factors, knowledge of which has existed since the mid-19th century.<br \/>\nAthens is affected by the\u00a0urban heat island\u00a0effect in some areas which is caused by human activity,\u00a0altering its temperatures compared to the surrounding rural areas,\u00a0and leaving detrimental effects on energy usage, expenditure for cooling,\u00a0and health.\u00a0The urban heat island of the city has also been found to be partially responsible for alterations of the climatological temperature time-series of specific Athens meteorological stations, because of its impact on the temperatures and the temperature trends recorded by some meteorological stations.\u00a0On the other hand, specific meteorological stations, such as the National Garden station and Thiseio meteorological station, are less affected or do not experience the urban heat island.<br \/>\nAthens holds the\u00a0World Meteorological Organization\u00a0record for the highest temperature ever recorded in Europe, at 48.0\u00a0\u00b0C (118.4\u00a0\u00b0F), which was recorded in the\u00a0Elefsina\u00a0and Tatoi suburbs of Athens on 10 July 1977.<\/p>\n<p><strong>NEIGHBOURHOODS<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Omonoia,\u00a0<\/strong>Omonoia Square,\u00a0is the oldest square in Athens. It is surrounded by hotels and fast food outlets, and contains a train station used by the\u00a0Athens Metro\u00a0and the Ilektrikos, named\u00a0Omonoia station. The square is the focus for celebration of sporting victories, as seen after the country&#8217;s winning of the\u00a0Euro 2004\u00a0and the\u00a0EuroBasket 2005\u00a0tournaments.<br \/>\n<strong>Metaxourgeio<\/strong> is located north of the historical centre of Athens, between Kolonos to the east and Kerameikos to the west, and north of Gazi.\u00a0Metaxourgeio\u00a0is frequently described as a transition neighborhood. After a long period of abandonment in the late 20th century, the area is acquiring a reputation as an artistic and fashionable neighborhood following the opening of art galleries, museums, restaurants and caf\u00e9s.<br \/>\n<strong>Psiri and Gazi\u00a0<\/strong>\u2013 The reviving\u00a0Psiri neighbourhood \u2013 also known as Athens&#8217;s &#8220;meat packing district&#8221; \u2013 is dotted with renovated former mansions, artists&#8217; spaces, and small gallery areas. A number of its renovated buildings also host fashionable bars, making it a hotspot for the city in the last decade, while live music restaurants known as &#8220;rebetadika&#8221;, after\u00a0rebetiko, a unique form of music that blossomed in\u00a0Syros\u00a0and Athens from the 1920s until the 1960s, are to be found. Rebetiko is admired by many, and as a result rebetadika are often crammed with people of all ages who will sing, dance and drink till dawn.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Gazi\u00a0area, one of the latest in full redevelopment, is located around a historic gas factory, now converted into the\u00a0Technopolis\u00a0cultural multiplex, and also includes artists&#8217; areas, small clubs, bars and restaurants, as well as Athens&#8217;s &#8220;Gay village&#8221;. The metro&#8217;s expansion to the western suburbs of the city has brought easier access to the area since spring 2007, as the blue line now stops at Gazi (Kerameikos\u00a0station).<br \/>\n<strong>Syntagma<\/strong>,\u00a0Syntagma Square, is the capital&#8217;s central and\u00a0largest square, lying adjacent to the\u00a0Greek Parliament\u00a0(the former Royal Palace) and the city&#8217;s most notable\u00a0hotels. Ermou Street, an approximately one-kilometre-long (0.62-mile) pedestrian road connecting\u00a0Syntagma Square\u00a0to Monastiraki, is a consumer paradise for both Athenians and tourists. Complete with fashion shops and shopping centres promoting most international brands, it now finds itself in the top five most expensive shopping streets in Europe, and the tenth most expensive retail street in the world.\u00a0Nearby, the renovated Army Fund building in Panepistimiou Street includes the &#8220;Attica&#8221;\u00a0department store\u00a0and several upmarket designer stores.<br \/>\n<strong>Plaka, Monastiraki, and Thission\u00a0<\/strong>\u2013\u00a0Plaka lying just beneath the\u00a0Acropolis, is famous for its plentiful\u00a0neoclassical architecture, making up one of the most scenic districts of the city. It remains a prime tourist destination with\u00a0tavernas, live performances and street salesmen. Nearby\u00a0Monastiraki, for its part, is known for its string of small shops and markets, as well as its crowded\u00a0flea market\u00a0and tavernas specialising in\u00a0souvlaki. Another district known for its student-crammed, stylish caf\u00e9s is\u00a0Theseum\u00a0or Thission, lying just west of Monastiraki. Thission is home to the ancient\u00a0Temple of Hephaestus, standing atop a small hill. This area also has a picturesque 11th-century Byzantine church, as well as a 15th-century Ottoman mosque.<br \/>\n<strong>Exarcheia<\/strong>, located north of Kolonaki, is the location of the city&#8217;s\u00a0anarchist\u00a0scene and as a student quarter with caf\u00e9s, bars and bookshops. Exarcheia is home to the\u00a0Athens Polytechnic\u00a0and the\u00a0National Archaeological Museum; it also contains important buildings of several 20th-century styles:\u00a0Neoclassicism,\u00a0Art Deco\u00a0and\u00a0Early Modernism\u00a0(including\u00a0Bauhaus\u00a0influences).<br \/>\n<strong>Kolonaki<\/strong>\u00a0is the area at the base of\u00a0Lycabettus hill, full of boutiques catering to well-heeled customers by day, and bars and more fashionable restaurants by night, with galleries and museums. This is often regarded as one of the more prestigious areas of the capital.<\/p>\n<p><strong>PARKS AND ZOOS<br \/>\n<\/strong>Parnitha National Park is punctuated by well-marked paths, gorges, springs, torrents and caves dotting the protected area. Hiking and mountain-biking in all four mountains are popular outdoor activities for residents of the city. The\u00a0National Garden of Athens\u00a0was completed in 1840 and is a green refuge of 15.5 hectares in the centre of the Greek capital. It is to be found between the Parliament and\u00a0Zappeion\u00a0buildings, the latter of which maintains its own garden of seven hectares.<br \/>\nParts of the city centre have been redeveloped under a masterplan called the\u00a0Unification of Archeological Sites of Athens, which has also gathered funding from the EU to help enhance the project.\u00a0The landmark\u00a0Dionysiou Areopagitou Street\u00a0has been pedestrianised, forming a scenic route. The route starts from the\u00a0Temple of Olympian Zeus\u00a0at Vasilissis Olgas Avenue, continues under the southern slopes of the Acropolis near\u00a0Plaka, and finishes just beyond the\u00a0Temple of Hephaestus\u00a0in\u00a0Thiseio. The route in its entirety provides visitors with views of the\u00a0Parthenon\u00a0and the\u00a0Agora\u00a0(the meeting point of ancient Athenians), away from the busy city centre.<br \/>\nThe hills of Athens also provide green space.\u00a0Lycabettus,\u00a0Philopappos hill\u00a0and the area around it, including\u00a0Pnyx\u00a0and\u00a0Ardettos hill, are planted with pines and other trees, with the character of a small forest rather than typical metropolitan parkland. Also to be found is the\u00a0Pedion tou Areos\u00a0(Field of Mars) of 27.7 hectares, near the\u00a0National Archaeological Museum.<br \/>\nAthens&#8217; largest zoo is the\u00a0Attica Zoological Park, a 20-hectare (49-acre) private zoo located in the suburb of Spata. The zoo is home to around 2000 animals representing 400 species, and is open 365 days a year.<\/p>\n<p><strong>METROPOLITAN AREA.<\/strong> The Athens Metropolitan Area consists of 58\u00a0densely populated municipalities, sprawling around the municipality of Athens (the city centre) in virtually all directions. For the Athenians, all the urban municipalities surrounding the city centre are called suburbs. According to their geographic location in relation to the City of Athens, the suburbs are divided into four zones.<br \/>\nThe Athens city coastline, extending from the major commercial port of\u00a0Piraeus\u00a0to the southernmost suburb of\u00a0Varkiza\u00a0for some 25\u00a0km (20\u00a0mi),\u00a0is also connected to the city centre by a tram.<br \/>\nIn the northern suburb of Maroussi, the upgraded main\u00a0Olympic Complex\u00a0(known by its Greek acronym OAKA) dominates the skyline. The area has been redeveloped according to a design by the Spanish architect\u00a0Santiago Calatrava, with steel arches, landscaped gardens, fountains, futuristic glass, and a landmark new blue glass roof which was added to the main stadium. A second Olympic complex, next to the sea at the beach of Palaio Faliro, also features modern stadia, shops and an elevated esplanade. Work is underway to transform the grounds of the old Athens Airport \u2013 named\u00a0Elliniko\u00a0\u2013 in the southern suburbs, into one of the largest landscaped parks in Europe, to be named the\u00a0Hellenikon Metropolitan Park.<\/p>\n<p><strong>POPULATION IN ANCIENT TIMES<br \/>\n<\/strong>Mycenean\u00a0Athens in 1600\u20131100\u00a0BC could have reached the size of\u00a0Tiryns; that would put the population at the range of 10,000 \u2013 15,000.\u00a0During the\u00a0Greek Dark Ages\u00a0the population of Athens was around 4,000 people. In 700\u00a0BC the population grew to 10,000. In 500\u00a0BC the area probably contained 200,000 people. During the classical period the city&#8217;s population is estimated from 150,000\u2013350,000 and up to 610,000 according to\u00a0Thucydides. When\u00a0Demetrius of Phalerum\u00a0conducted a population census in 317\u00a0BC the population was 21,000 free citizens, plus 10,000 resident aliens and 400,000 slaves. This suggests a total population of 431,000.\u00a0This figure is highly suspect because of the lopsided number of slaves and does not include free women and children and resident foreigners: an estimated based on Thucydides is: 40,000 male citizens, 100,000 family members, 70,000 metics (resident foreigners) and 150,000-400,000 slaves. However the numbers would include Attica and not just Athens the city.<br \/>\nThe ancient site of Athens is centred on the rocky hill of the acropolis. In ancient times the port of\u00a0Piraeus\u00a0was a separate city, but it has now been absorbed into the Athens Urban Area. The rapid expansion of the city, which continues to this day, was initiated in the 1950s and 1960s, because of Greece&#8217;s transition from an agricultural to an\u00a0industrial nation.\u00a0The expansion is now particularly toward the East and North East (a tendency greatly related to the new\u00a0Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport\u00a0and the\u00a0Attiki Odos, the freeway that cuts across\u00a0Attica). By this process Athens has engulfed many former suburbs and villages in Attica, and continues to do so. The table below shows the historical population of Athens in recent times.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GOVERNMENT and POLITICS<br \/>\n<\/strong>Athens became the capital of Greece in 1834, following\u00a0Nafplion, which was the provisional capital from 1829. The municipality (City) of Athens is also the capital of the\u00a0Attica region. The term\u00a0Athens\u00a0can refer either to the municipality of Athens, to Greater Athens, or to the entire Athens Urban Area.<\/p>\n<p><strong>OTHER LOCATIONS NAMED AFTER ATHENS<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>United States:\u00a0<\/strong>Athens, Alabama\u00a0(pop. 24,234),\u00a0Athens, Arkansas,\u00a0Athens, California,\u00a0West Athens, California\u00a0(pop. 9,101).\u00a0Athens, Georgia\u00a0(pop. 114,983),\u00a0Athens, Illinois\u00a0(pop. 1,726),\u00a0New Athens, Illinois\u00a0(pop. 2,620),\u00a0New Athens Township, St. Clair County, Illinois\u00a0(pop. 2,620),\u00a0Athens, Indiana,\u00a0Athens, Kentucky,\u00a0Athens, Louisiana\u00a0(pop. 262),\u00a0Athens Township, Jewell County, Kansas\u00a0(pop. 74),\u00a0Athens, Maine\u00a0(pop. 847),\u00a0Athens, Michigan\u00a0(pop. 1,111),\u00a0Athens Township, Michigan\u00a0(pop. 2,571),\u00a0Athens, Minnesota,\u00a0Athens Township, Minnesota\u00a0(pop. 2,322),\u00a0Athens, Mississippi,\u00a0Athens (town), New York\u00a0(pop. 3,991),\u00a0Athens (village), New York\u00a0(pop. 1,695),\u00a0Athens, Ohio\u00a0(pop. 21,909),\u00a0Athens County, Ohio\u00a0(pop. 62,223),\u00a0Athens Township, Athens County, Ohio\u00a0(pop. 27,714),\u00a0Athens Township, Harrison County, Ohio\u00a0(pop. 520),\u00a0New Athens, Ohio\u00a0(pop. 342),\u00a0Athena, Oregon\u00a0(pop. 1,270),\u00a0Athens, Pennsylvania\u00a0(pop. 3,415),\u00a0Athens Township, Bradford County, Pennsylvania\u00a0(pop. 5,058),\u00a0Athens Township, Crawford County, Pennsylvania\u00a0(pop. 775),\u00a0Athens, Tennessee\u00a0(pop. 13,220),\u00a0Athens, Texas\u00a0(pop. 11,297),\u00a0Athens, Vermont\u00a0(pop. 340),\u00a0Athens, West Virginia\u00a0(pop. 1,102),\u00a0Athens, Wisconsin\u00a0(pop. 1,095)<br \/>\n<strong>Canada:\u00a0<\/strong>Athens Township, Ontario\u00a0(pop. 3,086)<br \/>\n<strong>Costa Rica:\u00a0<\/strong>Atenas\u00a0(pop. 7,716),\u00a0Atenas (canton)\u00a0(pop. 23,743)<br \/>\n<strong>Germany:\u00a0<\/strong>Athenstedt, Saxony-Anhalt (pop.\u00a0431)<br \/>\n<strong>Italy:\u00a0<\/strong>Atena Lucana,\u00a0Province of Salerno, Campania (pop. 2,344),\u00a0Atina,\u00a0Province of Frosinone, Lazio (pop. 4,480)<br \/>\n<strong>Poland <\/strong>Ateny, Podlaskie Voivodeship\u00a0(pop. 40)<br \/>\n<strong>Ukraine<\/strong> Afini\u00a0(Zoria \u2013 \u0417\u043e\u0440\u044f),\u00a0Donetsk\u00a0(pop. 200)<\/p>\n<p><strong>AIRPORT.<\/strong> Athens is served by the\u00a0Athens International Airport\u00a0(ATH), located near the town of\u00a0Spata, in the eastern Messoghia plain, some 35\u00a0km (22\u00a0mi) east of Athens.\u00a0The airport, awarded the &#8220;European Airport of the Year 2004&#8221; Award,\u00a0is intended as an expandable hub for air travel in\u00a0southeastern Europe.<br \/>\nThe airport is served by the Metro, the\u00a0suburban rail, buses to\u00a0Piraeus\u00a0port, Athens&#8217; city centre and its suburbs, and also taxis.<br \/>\nIn 2018,the airport handled 24,135,736 a huge increase over the last 4 years, In 2014, the airport handled 15,196,369 passengers, an increase of 21.2% over the previous year of 2013.\u00a0Of those 15,196,369 passengers, 5,267,593 passed through the airport for domestic flights,\u00a0and 9,970,006 passengers travelled through for international flights.\u00a0Beyond the dimensions of its passenger capacity, ATH handled 205,294 total flights in 2007, or approximately 562 flights per day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ARCHAEOLOGICAL HUB<br \/>\n<\/strong>The city is a world centre of\u00a0archaeological research. Along with national institutions, such as the\u00a0Athens University\u00a0and the\u00a0Archaeological Society, there are multiple archaeological Museums including the\u00a0National Archaeological Museum, the\u00a0Cycladic Museum, the\u00a0Epigraphic\u00a0Museum, the\u00a0Byzantine &amp; Christian Museum, as well as museums at the ancient\u00a0Agora,\u00a0Acropolis,\u00a0Kerameikos, and the\u00a0Kerameikos Archaeological Museum. The city is also home to the\u00a0Demokritos\u00a0laboratory for\u00a0Archaeometry, alongside regional and national archaeological authorities that form part of the\u00a0Greek Department of Culture.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ARCHITECTURE.<\/strong> Athens incorporates\u00a0architectural styles\u00a0ranging from\u00a0Greco-Roman\u00a0and\u00a0Neoclassical\u00a0to modern times. They are often to be found in the same areas, as Athens is not marked by a uniformity of architectural style. A visitor will quickly notice the absence of tall buildings: Athens has very strict\u00a0height restriction laws\u00a0in order to ensure the Acropolis hill is visible throughout the city.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TOURISM<br \/>\n<\/strong>Athens has been a destination for travellers since antiquity. Over the past decade, the city&#8217;s infrastructure and social amenities have improved, in part because of its successful bid to stage the\u00a02004 Olympic Games. The Greek Government, aided by the EU, has funded major infrastructure projects such as the state-of-the-art\u00a0Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport,\u00a0the expansion of the\u00a0Athens Metro\u00a0system,\u00a0and the new\u00a0Attiki Odos\u00a0Motorway.<br \/>\nAthens was voted as the third best European city to visit in 2015 by European Best Destination. More than 240,000 people voted.<\/p>\n<p><strong>OLYMPIC GAMES<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>1896 Summer Olympics.<\/strong> 1896 brought forth the revival of the modern Olympic Games, by Frenchman\u00a0Pierre de Coubertin. Thanks to his efforts, Athens was awarded the first modern Olympic Games. In 1896, the city had a population of 123,000\u00a0and the event helped boost the city&#8217;s international profile. Of the venues used for these Olympics, the\u00a0Kallimarmaro\u00a0Stadium, and\u00a0Zappeion\u00a0were most crucial. The Kallimarmaro is a replica of the ancient Athenian stadiums, and the only major stadium (in its capacity of 60,000) to be made entirely of white marble from Mount\u00a0Penteli, the same material used for construction of the\u00a0Parthenon.<br \/>\n<strong>1906 Summer Olympics<\/strong>. The\u00a01906 Summer Olympics, or the 1906 Intercalated games, were held in Athens. The intercalated competitions were intermediate games to the internationally organized Olympics, and were meant to be organized in Greece every four years, between the main Olympics. This idea later lost support from the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/International_Olympic_Committee\">IOC<\/a>\u00a0and these games were discontinued.<br \/>\n<strong>2004 Summer Olympics. <\/strong>Although the heavy cost was criticized, estimated at $1.5\u00a0billion, Athens was transformed into a more functional city that enjoys modern technology both in transportation and in modern\u00a0urban development.\u00a0Some of the finest sporting venues in the world were created in the city, all of which were fully ready for the games. The games welcomed over 10,000 athletes from all 202 countries.<br \/>\nThe 2004 Games were judged a success, as both security and organization worked well, and only a few visitors reported minor problems mainly concerning accommodation issues. The 2004 Olympic Games were described as\u00a0Unforgettable, dream Games, by IOC President\u00a0Jacques Rogge\u00a0for their return to the birthplace of the Olympics, and for meeting the challenges of holding the Olympic Games.\u00a0The only observable problem was a somewhat sparse attendance of some early events. Eventually, however, a total of more than 3.5\u00a0million tickets were sold, which was higher than any other Olympics with the exception of Sydney (more than 5\u00a0million tickets were sold there in 2000).<br \/>\nIn 2008 it was reported that most of the Olympic venues had fallen into disrepair: according to those reports, 21 of the 22 facilities built for the games had either been left abandoned or are in a state of dereliction, with several\u00a0squatter\u00a0camps having sprung up around certain facilities, and a number of venues afflicted by\u00a0vandalism, graffiti or strewn with rubbish.\u00a0These claims, however, are disputed and likely to be inaccurate, as most of the facilities used for the\u00a0Athens Olympics\u00a0are either in use or in the process of being converted for post-Olympics use. The Greek Government has created a corporation, Olympic Properties SA, which is overseeing the post-Olympics management, development and conversion of these facilities, some of which will be sold off (or have already been sold off) to the private sector,\u00a0while other facilities are still in use just as during the Olympics, or have been converted for commercial use or modified for other sports.\u00a0Concerts and theatrical shows, such as those by the troupe Cirque du Soleil, have recently been held in the complex.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Athens (pop 3.8 million) Athens\u00a0(Ancient Greek: Ath\u00eanai) is the\u00a0capital\u00a0and\u00a0largest\u00a0city of\u00a0Greece.
