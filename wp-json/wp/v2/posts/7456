Mike Brewster, who&#8217;s been there, tells me it&#8217;s pronounced &#8220;tie tay&#8221; (accent on first syllable). The trip itself, scheduled for Wednesday, June 18th, was of course cancelled because of bad weather, but the leader was able to make some explorations in the area.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Access is usually via Silverton and Silverton Creek. When I did a reconnaissance on the preceding Monday, I found the road blocked at about km 12.5 near an old mine site. Dave Fitchett of MoF says his crews are scheduled to clear the blockage early this summer. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">As the weather wasn&#8217;t bad, I took the opportunity to scramble Mt. Heyland (8,350&#8242;) from the west. The best (use that word guardedly) approach is to walk the road to the cut block just beyond the mine and make for the steep west ridge leading to Heyland&#8217;s west face. It&#8217;s an easy scramble once you&#8217;re in the alpine, but not a trip you want to do more than once. Three hours to the summit.
