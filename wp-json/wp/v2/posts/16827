Videographers record the event. Eight or more children\u2014relatives and friends from the neighborhood\u2014push each other out of the way to get a better view. Afterward Petrus will remain at home, in his coffin, until his funeral in December, four months from now. His wife will live in the house with him until then; some families follow the old custom of never leaving a dead person alone. Until the funeral, Elisabeth and her children will call him\u00a0<i>to makula\u2019<\/i>\u2014a sick person. \u201cWe believe that even though the father is to makula\u2019, his soul is still in the house,\u201d Yokke says.<\/p>\n<p>For Torajans, the death of the body isn\u2019t the abrupt, final, severing event of the West. Instead, death is just one step in a long, gradually unfolding process. Late loved ones are tended at home for weeks, months, or even years after death. Funerals are often delayed as long as necessary to gather far-flung relatives. The grandest funeral ceremonies are week-long events drawing Torajans home in a vast reverse diaspora from wherever in the world they may be. When a brigade of a hundred or more motorcycles and cars rips through town accompanying a corpse home from far away, traffic stops in a manner that not even an ambulance or a police officer can command. Here, death trumps life.<\/p>\n<p>Torajans do not reject medical treatments for life-threatening conditions. Nor do they escape grief when loved ones die. But far from pushing death away, almost everyone here holds death at the center of life. Torajans believe that people aren\u2019t really dead when they die and that a profound human connection lasts well past death. Death for many Torajans is not a brick wall but a gauze veil. It is not a severing but just another kind of connection. Often in Toraja the deep link with a loved one doesn\u2019t end at the grave. Periodically some northern Torajans bring their relatives out of their tombs to give them fresh clothing and burial shrouds.<\/p>\n<p>No one knows exactly when Torajan\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/news.nationalgeographic.com\/2016\/03\/160314-pictures-death-ritual-funeral-burial-ceremony-people-culture\/\">death practices<\/a>\u00a0began. The Torajan language was written down only in the early 20th century, so most of the old traditions are still oral. Only recently, through carbon dating of wooden coffin fragments, have archaeologists concluded that there are Torajan death practices that date back at least as far as the ninth century A.D. The first Dutch ships arrived in what is now\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/travel\/destination\/indonesia\">Indonesia<\/a>\u00a0in the late 16th century, searching for nutmeg and cloves. Just over 300 years later they reached Toraja, a cultural region that today encompasses the districts of Toraja Utara and Tana Toraja. Thanks to Dutch missionaries, it\u2019s a Christian enclave, made up mostly of Protestants but also Roman Catholics, in a majority-Muslim country. Christianity has tried more or less successfully to partner with traditional practices: Nearly every step of a Torajan death is greeted with prayers, readings from Matthew or John, and a recitation of the Lord\u2019s Prayer.<\/p>\n<div>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--content-width InlineElement--desktop InlineVideo\" aria-label=\"Video\">\n<div class=\"SingleVideo\">\n<div data-meta-id=\"inline-4\">\n<div class=\"NatGeoVideoPlayer NatGeoVideoPlayer--videoPlaying aspect-ratio--parent aspect-ratio--16x9 VideoPlayer\">\n<div class=\"VideoPlayer--placeholder absolute-fill\">\n<div class=\"MediaPlaceholder relative MediaPlaceholder--16x9 cursor-pointer height-contain\" tabindex=\"-1\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent MediaPlaceholder__Image\">\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper aspect-ratio--child\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/13c2d086-aa2f-4a97-9f82-4efe30fbc9cc\/00000153-3e23-d365-a5d3-3f6725da0000.jpg?w=1272&amp;h=716\" alt=\"\" aria-hidden=\"true\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<div class=\"MediaPlaceholder__Overlay absolute-fill flex flex-center-all\">\n<div class=\"MediaPlaceholder__Pill  items-center absolute flex\" aria-hidden=\"true\">3:53<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"LoadAnimation LoadAnimation--darkBG LoadAnimation--md\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<p class=\"Caption__Title\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"RichText\">LIFE BEYOND DEATH<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Toraja is dotted with villages perched high on the side of cliffs or nestled deep in the valleys below.

The villages in turn are connected only by winding, one-lane dirt paths carrying two-lane traffic that dodges dogs and toddlers along routes pocked with head-banging, watermelon-size ruts.<\/p>\n<p>I made the rough trek here after years spent writing and speaking about an American way of death that glorifies medicine and drugs but fears death, which it considers a failure of technology or will. That leaves most Americans dying in institutions, when the majority say they would prefer to die in peace at home. After my husband, Terence, died, I began seeking alternatives. I have come here to explore a culture that is even more extreme, but in the opposite direction.<\/p>\n<div class=\"EmbedInline\">\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--below-paragraph InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop\" aria-label=\"markup\" data-bumper-index=\"7\">\n<div class=\"static--markup\">\n<div id=\"g-Joy_in_death-box\" class=\"ai2html\">\n<div id=\"g-Joy_in_death-Artboard_1\" class=\"g-artboard \">\n<div id=\"g-Joy_in_death-Artboard_1-graphic\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"g-ai0-0\" class=\"g-aiImg\" src=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/interactive-assets\/nggraphics\/content\/dam\/magazine\/2016\/04\/Joy_in_death-Artboard_1.png\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"g-ai0-1\" class=\"g-ai2html-settings g-aiAbs\">\n<p class=\"g-aiPstyle0\">Toraja Heartland.

With more than half of Torajans living elsewhere, funerary rituals bring families back together.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Funerals glue Torajans tightly, one family to the next, one village to the next. Funerals consume savings as people outdo each other in gifts of animals, creating multigenerational obligations and conspicuous consumption. Your cousin donates a buffalo? You must give a bigger one. You can\u2019t repay a past gift? Then your son or daughter must. If they can\u2019t, the burden will fall to your grandchildren. This dark side of funeral obligations can be clearly heard in the cries of the emcee announcing the gifts. \u201cWhose pig is this?\u201d he intones over a loudspeaker. \u201cWhose buffalo is this?\u201d In a metal-roofed shelter below, government officials tally the quality and size of each gift for tax purposes. At the ceremony\u2019s end the neat ledger will be presented to the family, which will be expected to reciprocate when some member of a giver\u2019s family dies.<\/p>\n<p>Torajan funerals are also great fun. A funeral is a wedding, a bar mitzvah, and a family reunion all in one, easily outstripping the conviviality of Irish wakes. Lavish funerals are a chance to meet and mingle, to eat and drink well, to enjoy games and entertainment\u2014even to network for jobs or eye prospective mates. There are water buffalo fights. (\u201cNo gambling,\u201d the emcee announces. \u201cThe family is Christian, and the police are here. The family does not support gambling.\u201d) As a cry goes up summoning the strongest to move the coffin to the tower, at least 50 young men seize the bamboo poles. They chant their way around the field, pumping the coffin up and down as the lyrics grow bawdy: something about body parts, and size, and sexual prowess. A water fight breaks out, with the bearers drenching each other, and the guests, with water from plastic cups.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou can make an excuse for a wedding, but you have to come to a funeral,\u201d says Daniel Rantetasak, 52, who sits one bright afternoon in the VIP section at the funeral of Lassi Allo To\u2019dang, Dinda\u2019s grandfather. Daniel figures he has attended more than 300 funerals in his lifetime. He says that at a funeral like this a minimum of 24 buffalo should be sacrificed. Sometimes the number may exceed a hundred. At an average of 20 million rupiah per buffalo ($1,425)\u2014prices can go much higher for the most prized, mottled ones\u2014an elite funeral can top $400,000 in buffalo costs alone, paid for by socially compulsory donations and by the many family members who send money home from abroad. Food and drink for hundreds of guests and temporary bamboo housing for visitors add to the costs. People devote resources to funerals even while struggling to pay $10,000 for university expenses. One woman remembers her grandmother saying funds were too scarce to pay for college. A few weeks later her grandmother spent thousands on pigs for a relative\u2019s ceremony. \u201cI was a victim of tradition,\u201d the woman says. It is commonly said that in Toraja, one lives to die<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--below-paragraph InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\" data-bumper-index=\"15\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/bc57830c-d2cc-4f72-8f2c-4da02b2a9aa9\/STOCK_MM8366_140527_012065.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=1706\" alt=\"friends and family carrying a body to its grave in a funeral bier\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\">\n<p>Friends and family carry the body of Abraham Papa to his grave in a wooden\u00a0<i>duba duba,\u00a0<\/i>a funeral bier made to resemble the ancestral family homes, called\u00a0<i>tongkonan,\u00a0<\/i>that dot Toraja.

Torajans look on unfazed; their concern is more for the group than the individual, says Stanislaus Sandarupa, a Torajan and a linguistic anthropologist at Hasanuddin University, in Makassar. The buffalo\u2019s obligation, he says, is to provide meat to ensure human existence. People, in turn, must care for the species and make sure it endures.<\/p>\n<p><b>While the funeral\u00a0<\/b>is unfolding in town, another set of ceremonies is taking place in the countryside.

After all, we Westerners cringe at the sight of a corpse. Confronted with several, I find myself curiously calm and interested. Everyone is festive, wearing bright colors and appearing decidedly happy. The smell is musty, like a bunch of blankets put away wet and stored for several years. The sight is definitely odd but surprisingly not unpleasant or gruesome. \u201cThe way they handle the bodies, it\u2019s not scary at all,\u201d says Ki Tan, an Indonesian who grew up in the Netherlands, as he watches a family interact with a group of long-dead loved ones, including a year-old child, dead for 38 years. Nearby, a 21-year-old backpacker from Berlin grows reflective. \u201cI feel very lucky to have seen this,\u201d says Maria Hart, recalling sadly that she was so upset by her own grandfather\u2019s death that she refused to attend his funeral. \u201cOn a personal level, I take some comfort in the tradition,\u201d says Kathleen Adams, an anthropologist at Loyola University Chicago who has lived among Torajans and their dead.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<p><b>The important thing,\u00a0<\/b>Torajans say, is that they are not just individuals. The death of one person is only the dropping of a single stitch in an intricate financial, social, and emotional canvas winding backward through ancestors and forward through children. How did Torajans come to believe this? I wonder. Go ask Kambuno, the people say. He\u2019s the man who knows the answers.<\/p>\n<p>In search of Kambuno, we wind northward from the small town of Pangala, skirting rice fields and passing through village after village. Shopkeepers, motorbike riders, and passersby direct us. Everyone knows where Kambuno lives. Two schoolgirls in white shirts, navy skirts, and black ties hop in the car to point the way. When the road peters out, we continue on foot up a steep, rocky course.<\/p>\n<p>We find Petrus Kambuno, wiry, goateed, almost toothless, cutting grass by the side of the road. \u201cYou are lucky you found me,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is no one left but me who knows these stories.\u201d He claims to be 90 years old. He spins a Genesis-like creation tale, with Toraja at its center. \u201cHere God created man in heaven, and woman from the Earth,\u201d he says. Looking out over lime green terraced rice fields framed against an aquamarine sky, it\u2019s easy to believe that God chose this to be his Eden.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--below-paragraph InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\" data-bumper-index=\"23\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/f23533c7-8d69-4c16-91b0-f72856bc0baf\/MM8366_150901_019014.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=1706\" alt=\"Torajan woman grieving as her mother is buried\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\">\n<p>Tini Patiung breaks down moments before a group of men carry her mother to her grave.

So the question isn\u2019t why do Torajans do what they do, but why do we do what we do? How did we distance ourselves so much from death, which is, after all, just a part of life?
