With an autistic child, he was a self-taught outsider in the field. He firmly established autism as an inborn condition based on genetics and neurology rather than the complexities of the developing psyche. The book\u2019s popularity inspired him to start the National Society for Autistic Children, which helped end decades of shame and isolation for families like his and lobbied for legislation based on the principle that all children have the right to an education, including those with developmental disabilities. By crowdsourcing effective treatments, he gave parents a network of hope and progress when research in the field was at a virtual standstill because it was still believed to be so rare.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">He made direct communication with parents and challenged the authority of the psychiatric establishment. His E-1 form was the first standardized clinical tool for an autism assessment. Up to that point, the diagnosis was made strictly based on subjective observation by clinicians schooled in Kanner\u2019s and Eisenberg\u2019s methods. Children who didn\u2019t precisely fit Rimland\u2019s version of Kanner\u2019s model got only a diagnosis of \u201cautistic-like.\u201d In this act of winnowing,<\/p>\n<p>Rimland was again following in the footsteps of his mentor, who told him that nine out of ten children sent to his office with an autism diagnosis by other clinicians were not \u201ctrue cases.\u201d He planted the seeds of a revolution.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Like Kanner, he bitterly opposed the notion of autism as a continuum. He had controversial theories that the unified condition called autism is composed of many distinct subtypes, anticipating major shifts in mainstream science by decades. But by promoting the hope that autistic children could be fully \u201crecovered\u201d from autism with biomedical treatment, he diverted the energy and focus of the parents\u2019 movement he helped create into an endless quest for a cure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">He adopted Linus Pauling\u2019s theories of orthomolecular medicine \u2013 instead of using drugs, they manipulated water, vitamins, minerals, protein, and salt. Pauling had great credibility as one of the few two-time Nobel winners in history to transform the supplement business from a marginal enterprise serving health food stores into an alt-powerhouse with annual sales rivalling the pharmaceutical industry, minus the pesky Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The hardest thing to come by for parents of autistic children in the 60s was hope. Clinicians had little to offer beyond the standard advice to institutionalize the child and quietly remove their pictures from the family album. Parents determined to raise their children at home were condemned by trapping them in a psychologically toxic environment. Most psychologists in America were still convinced that they were constitutionally incapable of learning.<\/p>\n<p>Rimland used the terms training and conditioning. He also noted that little had been published about cases that had matured. <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Rimland also believed in megadoses of vitamins, encouraged by Linus Pauling\u2019s writing. Parents gave testimonials about their effectiveness. Potent multiple B vitamins, several grams of vitamin C, niacinamide, pyridoxine, and pantothenic acid (other B vitamins) were added. Magnesium was eventually also added to the advice of celebrity nutritionist Adele Davis. The drug was marketed as <em>Deaner<\/em> by Riker Pharmaceuticals. Parents rated the child\u2019s progress with biweekly reports charting speech, eating patterns, tantrums, and alertness.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The double-masked placebo-controlled trial is the gold standard of drug development in the pharmaceutical industry. Inevitably, both groups of patients will show some improvement because of the placebo effect. At the root of this is that the attention in an environment of care produces beneficial changes in the mind and body of the patient, even in the absence of the active drug. The mere act of swallowing a pill triggers cascades of hormones and neurotransmitters that can reduce pain and inflammation, enhance motor coordination, boost brain activity, lift mood, and improve digestion. These effects are pervasive, as if the body contains a self-healing network activated by the knowledge that one is receiving care. (Exercise and meditation also prompt this network into action.) If the volunteers in the placebo and experimental groups show comparable benefits, the FDA judges the drug as ineffective.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">However, Rimland decided not to use this well-established model of drug testing. With 45% of parents reporting that the vitamins \u201cdefinitely helped\u201d their children, Rimland was thrilled. He deflected all criticisms in a non-scientific argument, as all data were derived from subjective reports by parents and physicians who were likely to be enthusiastic about the project.<\/p>\n<p>Statisticians with access to the raw data concluded that no reliable information about the reaction of the patients to the vitamins could be obtained using Rimland\u2019s computer-clustering scheme. The design of the experiment \u2013 with parents as evaluators \u2013 was anything but \u201cblind\u201d and a perfect incubator for placebo effects. Rimland described that the vitamins were a \u201cnew psychic-energizer\u201d, precisely the phrase used by Riker Laboratories to promote them in ads in medical journals.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Deaner was aggressively marketed for a wide variety of fuzzily defined symptoms, including \u201cproblem\u201d behaviour, emotional instability, hyperactivity, and underachievement at school. The American Medical Association (AMA) was less enthused and issued a cautionary note about Deaner. The litany of vague complaints for which it was commonly prescribed \u201cis characterized by the difficulty in their evaluation, spontaneous fluctuations, and great susceptibility to suggestion.\u201d<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In other words, Deaner was the perfect placebo. It was also a gold mine for Riker Laboratories until the FDA finally took it off the market in 1983 after studies concluded that the drug didn\u2019t even rate as \u201cpossibly effective\u201d and also put children with epilepsy at heightened risk for grand mal seizures. Supplement manufacturers quickly stepped into the breach, promoting a mixed berry flavour called DMAE, combining it with fatty acids, soy, and other health food staples.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Rimland eventually encouraged his growing army of parent experimenters to try several treatments at once, making it nearly impossible to tease out the benefits and side effects of any single one. This gave the parents a tremendous sense of hope and momentum at a time when the mainstream science of autism was advancing at a snail\u2019s pace. He grew more isolated from his colleagues while being regarded as a lone voice in the wilderness by the parents in his network.<\/p>\n<p>Things finally came to a head at NSAC (by then called the Autism Society of America) when Rimland called for a motion requiring all members to put their children on a high-dose vitamin B-12 regimen immediately after diagnosis. Parents rebelled and, instead of backing down, Rimland went all in and resigned. He no longer had the clout to make such a power play and was voted off his organization&#8217;s board. The once-strong NSAC had been split into two.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>OLE IVAR LOVAAS<br \/>\n<\/strong>A psychologist from Los Angeles, he was also obsessed with the same obscure childhood disorder. He had no patience with psychoanalysis or the tendentious speculations of theory-based psychiatry. He developed behaviour modification and became a mentor to a generation of psychologists, therapists, and teachers at UCLA. Rewards and punishment were used in a tough-minded approach to teaching these children skills in their homes, enabling them to stay out of institutions and live semi-independent lives. Both he and Rimland believed that the permissive, indulgent attitude toward autistic children was damaging. Self-stimming was no longer tolerated. By forming an alliance and reaching out directly to parents, they gained credibility and influence far beyond what they had gained through peer-reviewed channels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>NATIONAL SOCIETY FOR AUTISTIC CHILDREN<br \/>\n<\/strong>One nonverbal autistic child assembled a jigsaw puzzle, and his mother accidentally made a mess. The child quickly reassembled the puzzle with the pieces upside down. However, he could no longer see the pattern they formed as a cue to their proper placement. He started speaking again and could instantly name the day of the week for nearly any date in the past or future. He would surprise his mother by recalling things the family had done years before. Once the diagnosis of autism was made, his mother started the National Society for Autistic Children. They discussed ways for parents to work together effectively to demand access to education and other services for their children. Chapters of the NSAC sprang up all over the country. They knew that their children needed help, that no one knew what was wrong with them, and that leaders in all the helping professions were blaming the parents for their children\u2019s disability. Naturally, they were angry. Medical lending libraries were established all over the country. The NSAC helped reframe autism in the minds of professionals from a form of childhood \u201cemotional disturbance\u201d to an inborn disability that required lifelong care and support.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Sign language was popular at some institutions, even for hearing students. Too much emphasis was being placed on teaching autistic children to speak when what was truly essential was enabling them to communicate.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">For years, the society\u2019s bimonthly newsletter was the only source of breaking news in the world of autism for families. Autism became accepted not as a single clinical entity but as composed of multiple distinct subtypes. Autistic intelligence &#8211; savant skills like enhanced ability in music, memory, art, mathematics, science, and technology became appreciated \u2013 very young children who could speak and write in multiple languages, had a total recall for various kinds of statistics, could instantly identify a note played on a piano, were able to calculate square roots in their heads, had precocious abilities in drawing, and were so aware of subtle aspects of their environments that they seemed to have ESP. And these were children who had all been branded as \u201cprofoundly retarded.\u201d|<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Another child demonstrated the untapped potential of these children. \u201cHe reads and understands books on electronics and uses the theories to build devices . . . He understands the theory of electronics, astronomy, music, navigation, and mechanics. He knows much about how things work and is familiar with technical terms. By 12, he could find his way all over the city on his bike with a map and compass. Joe is supposed to have an IQ of 80.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Rimland theorized that the achievements of geniuses like Einstein, Newton, and world chess champion Bobby Fischer were related to the fact that these men \u201cmanifested signs \u2013 sometimes several signs \u2013 of autism. \u201cIt may not be too far amiss to suggest that some autistic individuals are incipient geniuses whose eccentricities are so severe and incapacitating that all but minimal participation in the \u2018normal\u2019 world is precluded.\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Eric Schopler launched Division TEACCH (Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children) in North Carolina, the first statewide autism education program in the US and the model for many other progressive programs since.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">At the second NSAC conference in 1970, a young autistic man spoke. Twenty-one-year-old <strong>William Donovan<\/strong> clarified that he knew his environment, even when people assumed he was oblivious. \u201cAs an autistic child, I felt very uncomfortable. I tore up newspapers, pulled bedsheets off the beds, pulled books out of the bookcases, bounced cans, played with spinning tops, and broke every one. I want to take this opportunity to tell you that I destroyed things <em>because I couldn\u2019t talk<\/em>. I spun stuff because I couldn\u2019t speak. It also made me feel good, of course.<\/p>\n<p>I hated going to school because the classrooms were too confining. I didn\u2019t like the idea of the other kids making fun of me, and I didn\u2019t want anyone to pass judgment on me as to how good or bad I was.\u201d He described his teachers hitting him with rulers, locking him in a closet, and talking about him as if he weren\u2019t there. He spoke in echolalia until he was ten because he couldn\u2019t, not wouldn\u2019t, talk normally.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">He had been hired at a packaging factory, and his first day of work was the happiest day of his life. He talked about his love of Charlie Brown and playing music. He concluded, \u201cI feel wonderful here today. I feel like the President. I hope all autistic children can grow up to be socially acceptable.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Donovan\u2019s mother talked about how she had finally worked up the courage to take her son everywhere instead of hiding him in the house (or committing him to an institution, as she and her husband had been advised to do). \u201cNever be embarrassed about taking them places.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Both Rimland and Lovaas followed the path of making the children more \u201csocially acceptable\u201d and searched for an orthomolecular cure for autism. However, parents were not interested in finding a cure; instead, they wanted more services.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In 1974, West Virginia became the first state to specifically include autism in its mandatory public education laws, opening the doors of classrooms to hundreds of kids for the first time. The Education for All Handicapped Children Act was signed into law by President Gerald Ford in 1975, which became the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) that is in force today. Education services for adults were in demand. The traditional caretakers for autistic adults who were not in institutions were stay-at-home moms, and in the 1960s, more and more women were entering the workforce.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Over time, the NSAC\u2019s focus on services and Rimland\u2019s search for a cure diverged, resulting in Rimland&#8217;s removal from the board of his own organization.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">After beginning with acquisition trials that used positive reinforcement to encourage behaviours (when the behaviours improved dramatically), Lovaas used extinction trials that withheld smiles and praise. But the children regressed and resumed beating themselves. The possibility that the children were responding comprehensibly to the bizarre behaviour of the people around them didn\u2019t enter Lovaas\u2019s mind. He added physical punishment (aversive stimuli) to extinguish bad behaviour. He was criticized but failed to heed the advice of other authorities. The behaviour targeted for punishment included hand flapping, rocking, spinning, and other forms of self-stimulation.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Researchers eventually discovered that autistic people seem to reduce anxiety, and also simply because it feels good. Harmless forms of self-stimulation may facilitate learning by freeing up executive-functioning resources in the brain that would otherwise be devoted to suppressing them.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Lovaas did not give up his extinction experiments. Extraction was also used for tantrum behaviours, such as screaming, throwing objects, and hitting themselves. But the results were disappointing. A loud noise of over 100 decibels and an electric shock were added. Lovaas ventured that avoidance of pain generated contentment. He characterized it as a triumph of rationality over sentimentality \u2013 \u201cpunishment can be a very effective tool for behaviour change.\u201d He added food and water deprivation. Some viewed him as a \u201cvisionary\u201d. This shaped public perceptions of autism for decades.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Many NSAC parents refused to use aversives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Lovaas extended his theories to the \u201cFeminine Boy Project\u201d, in men and women who applied for gender reassignment surgery and wanted to see if operant conditioning could be employed as an early intervention in cases of gender confusion. He targeted the behaviours for extinction, including \u201climp wrist\u201d, \u201cswishy gait\u201d, the girlish \u201chyperextension of the limbs in moments of exuberance, and prissy declarations like \u201cgoodness gracious\u201d and \u201coh, dear me.\u201d Masculine behaviours were rewarded and feminine behaviours were punished. Their success turned into a cash cow for UCLA. Their star patient hanged himself at 38, after decades of depression.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The fundamental view became that it is easier to change a child\u2019s behaviour than to destigmatize it in society, whether it be limp wrists or flapping hands.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The ethical debate raged about whether intentionally inflicting pain in the name of treatment is a way to treat human beings, even if they are autistic and self-injurious. In 1988, the Autism Society of America (ABA) banned aversive techniques. But aversives were promoted well past that \u2013 withholding food and administering physical punishment to modify behaviour \u2013 still are used today, even in the face of public outcry against their use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Lovaas became disappointed that he produced no sudden cures. He learned that even self-injurious children were communicating in their ways. Exuberant use of echolalia was a distinctively autistic way of acquiring language. Many of the behaviours he had put children through hell to extinguish were attempts to find channels for self-expression. But one thing Lovaas never changed his mind about was that the best hope was for them to become \u201cnormal\u201d \u2013 purged of all traces of autistic behaviour. He claimed that it was essential to insulate his autistic subjects from exposure to other autistic children, calling it the \u201ckiss of death\u201d. His program entailed a level of commitment and support beyond most families&#8217; reach. A documentary claimed that, without his treatment, more than 95% of autistic children will require custodial care for the rest of their lives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Other long-time experts in the field remained skeptical. He was accused of front-loading his data by excluding \u201clow-functioning\u201d children while favouring those with unusually high IQs. Families in his studies had more resources available to them. Calling autistic children \u201cthe kiss of death\u201d in a classroom could result in kids all over the country being denied an education. Independent researchers have never been able to replicate the extraordinary findings in his 1987 paper.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>STEVE EDELSON<br \/>\n<\/strong>An undergraduate psychology\/sociology major at UCLA, he had been raised as a Christian Scientist, a sect founded in 1875 by a self-anointed prophet named Mary Baker Eddy who believed that diseases are not healed by doctoring but by submission to God. Traditionally, Christian Scientists eschew most aspects of modern medicine, including drugs, tests, hospitals, and vaccines. Edelson\u2019s curiosity about the neurochemistry of autism meshed perfectly with Rimland\u2019s interest in orthomolecular medicine. Together, they authored a book called <em>Recovering Autistic Children, <\/em>which\u00a0became the bible of the Biomed movement, along with books like Jacqueline McCandless\u2019s <em>Children with Starving Brains.<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The effort culminated in the launch of <strong>Defeat Autism Now!<\/strong> \u2013 a network of clinicians and alt-med practitioners on the GFCF diet and other treatments. At DAN! \u2013 sponsored events nationwide, \u201crecovered\u201d children were paraded in front of cheering crowds in an atmosphere befitting tent revival meetings. The fact that some children who displayed all the classic signs of early autism manage to grow up to become happy and well-adjusted adults without the benefit of elaborate elimination diets and gray-market drugs like secretin (a digestive hormone heavily promoted by Rimland that showed no evidence of benefit in placebo-controlled studies) had been forgotten and so had Kanner&#8217;s observation that one of the most crucial factors in determining the outcome of his patients was a sympathetic and tolerant reception by their teachers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">By then, the estimated prevalence of autism was spiking dramatically. Rimland looked beyond genetics for an explanation hidden in the toxic modern world. Eventually, he would zero in on vaccines and mercury as the most likely triggers of what appeared to be a rapidly accelerating epidemic of Kanner\u2019s once-rare disorder, launching the Autism Wars in earnest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">For parents of newly diagnosed children, the turn of the millennium was a time of great fear and great hope. The fear that their children had been stolen away from them by a mysterious and terrifying disorder triggered by routine events like taking a recommended drug during pregnancy or inoculating them against measles.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The hope is that ABA or the DAN! Protocol could make their children normal, and new technologies like DNA sequencing would uncover the elusive \u201cautism gene,\u201d which would make this baffling condition a thing of the past.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Catherine Maurice\u2019s <strong>Let Me Hear Your Voice<\/strong> expounded the thought that if parents invested enough time, effort, and expense, children would lose their diagnosis. Teams of therapists were lined up to give children forty hours a week of one-on-one ABA at home, on top of speech and occupational therapy. Parents went to DAN! Conferences and children seemed to benefit from some of the alternative treatments recommended by the members of Rimland\u2019s network.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A new group called <strong>Cure Autism Now<\/strong> (CAN) proposed eradicating autism. It was one of several parent groups launched in the late 1990s with similar names (Talk About Curing Autism was founded in 2000) that focused on biomedical interventions and genetic research rather than on improving families&#8217; access to services. Focusing on the need for services seemed like an admission of defeat at a time when the possibility of vanquishing autism permanently seemed to be in the air.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Autism Speaks became the most prominent autism fundraising organization in the world.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>BERNARD RIMLAND An obsessively curious Navy psychologist named Bernard Rimland wrote a book called Infantile Autism.
