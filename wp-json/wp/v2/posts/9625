It also encompasses the highest landmass in Britain \u2013 a broad mountain plateau with an average altitude of over 1000m and including 5 of the highest summits in the UK. It is riven only by the deep valleys of the Lairig Ghru and Loch Avon. This mountain landscape of granite and heather has a sub-Arctic climate supporting alpine tundra vegetation and high-altitude birds. Lower down are open forests of native Scots pine. It is prime hill-walking territory. The Cairngorm Mountain Railway toes up to the edge of the plateau.<br \/>\n<strong>Balmoral Castle<\/strong>. Built by Queen Victoria in 1855 as a private residence for the royal family, it is built in the Scottish Baronial style of architecture. The ticket only sees one of the 69 rooms, the ballroom, but instead concentrates on the gardens and fruit trees. As this was late April, there was not much to see at the ten stops. The castle is open only from April through July when the vegetable garden is in full swing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Braemar Castle.<\/strong> Just west of Balmoral is this castle dating from 1628 that controls vital passes. It was used as a government military garrison after the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion. It has now been taken over by the local community since 2007 \u2013 most of the original furniture was left.

The glaciers of the last ice age eroded a deep trough along the fault line, which is now filled by a series of lochs \u2013 Linnhe, Lochy, Oich, and Ness. General George Wade built a military road along the southern side of Loch Ness in the 18<sup>th<\/sup> century and in 1822, the various lochs were linked by the Caledonian Canal to create a cross-country waterway.

Start on either side and return on the other.<br \/>\nWhen I walked it, there were several anglers in waist-deep water fishing for salmon. A fellow on the bank deplored the lack of fish and suggested it was due to seals that came upriver with the tide. I think it is due to overfishing, both commercial and recreational. No fish can be taken before June and only 2 are allowed per year.<br \/>\n<strong>Wynd Castle &amp; Museum and Art Gallery.<\/strong> The castle is relatively modern and is the sheriff\u2019s office but has good views of the older parts of town.

The Duke of Cumberland, son of the reigning King George II and leader of the Hanoverian army earned the name \u2018Butcher\u2019 for his brutal treatment of the defeated Jacobite forces. The battle marked the end of the old clan system and the horrors of the clearances soon followed.<br \/>\n<strong>Fort George.<\/strong> It was established in 1748 in the aftermath of the Battle of Culloden as a base for George II\u2019s army of occupation in the Highlands. By the time of its completion in 1789, it had cost the equivalent of \u00a31 billion. Although it sits on the sea, it was built to withstand an attack from the land. It still functions as a military barracks. Several great videos tell the story and lots of places to visit.

The origins of the monster date to 1933 when a couple recounted the sighting of a creature rolling and plunging for a full minute. The story was taken up by the London press and sparked a flurry of sightings including the famous 1934 photograph taken by a supposedly reputable man, but since admitted to as a hoax. The rest is history. Sightings peaked in 1996-7 after the Hollywood movie Loch Ness was released, but reports have tailed off in recent years. A mini-industry of tour boats depart daily from Tomnahruich Bridge for the 3-6 hour cruise +\/- coach tour.<br \/>\n<strong>Loch Ness Circuit<\/strong>. I drove the 70-mile complete circuit of the lake. Starting on the NE side, drive along the water and head inland at Forers over the single-track roads high above the lake. I walked down to the lovely <strong>Falls of Foyers<\/strong> that cascade down to a big pool. There are several nice walks around the falls. On top, pass a lovely loch and then descend to Fort Augustus.<br \/>\nContinue south by Loch Oich, turn west at Invergarry and then continue on A87 along the north side of Loch Garry to the famous <strong>Glengarry Viewpoint<\/strong> \u2013 through a quirk of perspective, the lochs to the west appear to form the map outline of Scotland.<br \/>\nTurn north on the A87 and A887 and return to Loch Ness at <strong>Invermoriston<\/strong>.<br \/>\n<strong>Urquhart Castle.<\/strong> On the shores of Loch Ness, this medieval castle was visited by St Columba in the 6<sup>th<\/sup> century, fought over several times, and finally abandoned in 1692. The ruins occupy an iconic setting and are a popular tourist stop, especially for Loch Ness tours.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"irc_mil i3597 iTyfrsYNjUXc-zixyDjKkw5M\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pAQ3cWtkL6w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwjhitijvezaAhVKLcAKHUuiCcEQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/pAQ3cWtkL6w\/maxresdefault.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Urquhart Castle.\" width=\"623\" height=\"350\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>EAST COAST<br \/>\n<\/strong>The twisting A9 road follows the coast with rolling farmland extending to the Sutherland Mountains the backdrop to the west. The last cheap gas is in Dingwall.<br \/>\n<strong>Dornoch<\/strong> (pop 1200). This attractive old market town is all elegant sandstone. The last witch to be executed in Scotland was boiled alive in hot tar here in 1722 and Madonna married Guy Ritchie here in 2000. Dornoch Beach stretches for miles. I camped on the beach next to hole 16 of the famous Royal Dornoch golf links, one of Scotland\u2019s most famous.<br \/>\n<strong>Dunrobin Castle.<\/strong> A mile past Golspie, this castle dates to 1275 but most that you see was built between 1845-50. It was home to the first Duke of Sutherland notorious for some of the cruelest episodes of the Highland Clearances and is the Highland\u2019s largest house. I stopped early in the morning and wandered out to the back balcony for nice views over the geometric gardens and fountains.<br \/>\n<strong>Lybster.<\/strong> The spectacular coastline goes through villages established on the shoreline when communities were evicted from the interior in the Clearances. Lybster is a purpose-built fishing village dating from 1810. In its heyday, it was Scotland\u2019s third busiest port but now has only a few boats. I drove down to the picturesque harbour surrounded by grassy cliffs. It just happened that the weekly catch of crown crab (16 trays with 35kg each and a few lobsters) was being picked up by a seafood company.<br \/>\n<strong>Whaligoe Steps.<\/strong> At Ubster, 5 miles north of Lybster, don\u2019t miss descending these spectacular stairs cut into the cliff down to a tiny natural harbour. A flat bench supported by a massive stone wall supports a ruined house and lots of evidence of past fishing glory. Turn off the highway opposite the sign \u2018Cairn of Get\u2019 and drive down the minor road to a parking area marked for locals only. A caf\u00e9 is at the top of the stairs.<br \/>\n<strong>Grey Cairns of Camster.<\/strong> Dating from 4000 BC, these burial chambers are hidden in long, low mounds. The Long Cairn measures 60x21m and enters by crawling into the Round Cairn first. Turn off a mile east of Lybster on the A99 and drive 4 miles north.<br \/>\n<strong>John O\u2019Groats.<\/strong> Almost the most northerly point on the British mainland, it is the endpoint for the 874-mile trek from Land\u2019s End in Cornwall and a passenger ferry to Burwick in the Orkney.<br \/>\n<strong>Ferries to Orkney<\/strong>. I drove 5 miles west to Gills Bay to catch the Pentland Ferry to St Margaret\u2019s Hope on South Ronaldsay Island on Orkney (\u00a354). This is the cheapest way to get to Orkney. The Northlink Ferry from Scrabster (north of Thurso) goes to Stromness on Mainland Orkney and costs about \u00a380. It does pass the Old Man of Hoy, a sea stack on the west coast of Hoy.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>FORTH BRIDGE.
