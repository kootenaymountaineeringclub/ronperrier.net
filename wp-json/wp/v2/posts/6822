I lived next door to this creek for about six years. In the 1990s, the entire creek bed was involved in a massive landslide that closed the highway for several days. I never did hear the cause of the slide but assume it was related to logging above and a big rain in the spring on a hot day. The slide scoured the entire creek bed exposing the bedrock.<br \/>\n<\/em><em>The creek drops off a cliff right at Scotties Marina on Broadwater Road. Scotties is just before the Allendale Subdivision. The house I lived in was the Green House, the first house on the right on top of the hill just after Scotties and opposite the \u201cBig Beach\u201d, a large expanse of sand at low water. It is recommended that you ask Cory Scott, the owner of the Green house if you can walk up the driveway, go around the garage on the first level and contour around to the creek. There may be another access on the east side of Scotties.<br \/>\n<\/em><em>This is a great early season hike. The entire creek faces south, snow clears early and the creek is prettier with more water. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Difficulty<\/strong>: B2<br \/>\n<strong>Elevation gained:<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Key Elevations<\/strong>:<br \/>\n<strong>Distance<\/strong>:<br \/>\n<strong>Time<\/strong>:<br \/>\n<strong>Season:<\/strong> March to November.
