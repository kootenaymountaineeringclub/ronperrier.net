Would they undertake the beautiful voyage again? Yaaa\u2013probably not. Story and photographs by Douglas Noblet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Photographer Douglas Noblet likes to suffer. In 2016, the Nelson, British Columbia, native helped organize a team to ski traverse the Selkirk Mountains, from Kootenay Pass to the Mica Dam, north of Revelstoke, British Columbia. During that 36-day, 520-kilometre (323-mile) trip, they endured unseasonably low snowpack, two broken skis, two broken bindings, three broken poles, and a wily pine marten that stole two kilograms of food. (You can read about that adventure in KMC Winter 2016\/17.)<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_28060\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-28060\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/kootenaymountainculture.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/first-purcells-ski-traverse-8-340x212.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"593\" height=\"370\" \/><\/span><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-28060\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Lena Rowat joined our team for part of the Selkirk traverse and all of the Purcell traverse. I took this shot of her during the third leg of our Purcell traverse near Mount Findlay. The rest of the crew included me and Steve Senecal from Nelson, BC, and Mark Grist, Nick Matwyk, and Rowat from Vancouver.<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Despite the challenges of that trip, he and a core crew of four others decided to do another British Columbia traverse in April 2019, travelling from Creston to Golden, likely the first continuous ski trip along the entire length of the Purcell Mountain range. The team didn\u2019t suffer any broken gear, and the snowpack was better than their mission three years earlier,<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_28061\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-28061\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/kootenaymountainculture.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/first-purcells-ski-traverse-9-340x269.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"585\" height=\"463\" \/><\/span><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-28061\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">These are my skis at the lowest point in elevation: Howser Creek at 1,100 metres (3,610 feet). We had just waited out a two-day storm at a cabin near Jumbo Pass and had to make up some time before our food ran out. We skied to the Bugaboos in only three days while travelling through terrain that showed widespread natural avalanches on all aspects and elevations, except for this creek bottom.<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">but given that it was April, spring hazards were high and they regularly triggered avalanches up to size 2.5. Thankfully, no one was hurt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In all, the Purcells journey spanned 380 kilometres (236 miles) over 26 days and included 31,000 metres of vertical. \u201cPeople often ask me if I would do the trip again, and the answer is an easy, no!\u201d says Noblet. \u201cBut on the walk down Quarts Creek, myself and Steve [fellow Nelsonite Stephen Senecal] found ourselves talking about the Monashee traverse. Give us a season or two off and you might just see us attempting the next mountain range.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_28064\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-28064\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/kootenaymountainculture.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/first-purcells-ski-traverse-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1170\" height=\"726\" \/><\/span><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-28064\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Above: We had three others join us for the fourth leg of our trip, and this shows us crossing Howser Creek.

Earlier that day, we had to navigate through a one-kilometre-long avalanche trap with steep walls on either side. Because of a warm cycle that passed through a month earlier, the whole thing had already slid, and we skied on top of avalanche debris that was 15 metres high in places.<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_28063\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-28063\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/kootenaymountainculture.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/first-purcells-ski-traverse-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1170\" height=\"780\" \/><\/span><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-28063\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">We stayed at the Dewar Creek hot springs on our ninth and tenth nights.

That same storm was responsible for the death of three famous climbers in Banff National Park. We received an inReach text from Grist\u2019s mom in Mexico that read, \u201cBad news today: Avalanche buried 3 alpinists at Howse Peak. Careful, pls.\u201d Meanwhile, we could see avalanche debris on every aspect around us, including this fracture line that ran for over a kilometre.<\/span><\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_28059\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-28059\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/kootenaymountainculture.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/first-purcells-ski-traverse-7.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"701\" height=\"421\" \/><\/span><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-28059\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Grist boot packs the main crux of the trip, the 2,780-metre (9,120 feet) Lees and Clutterbuck col in the Purcell Wilderness Conservancy. We were unsure about getting through this section, but it turned out to be easy, and it led us to our best run: an 800-metre north-facing glacier run in 50 centimetres of hip-deep blower snow.<\/span><\/span>\u00a0<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>STATISTICS<br \/>\n26 &#8211; trip duration in days.<br \/>\n381 &#8211; total distance (kms)<br \/>\n31,230 &#8211; total vertical metres<br \/>\n5 &#8211; number of food caches<br \/>\n26 &#8211; the teams longest day in kilometres, 14 hours<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/kootenaymountainculture.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/first-purcells-ski-traverse-6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"393\" height=\"871\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/kootenaymountainculture.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/first-purcells-ski-traverse-5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"942\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p>KOOTENAY MOUNTAINEERING CULTURE MAGAZINE<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/article>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Gallery of Gruel \u2013 The First Winter Traverse of the Purcells Three years after an epic grunt along the length of the Selkirks, four British Columbia ski mountaineers lay claim to an equally arduous first-ever ski traverse of the neighbouring &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2025\/07\/24\/winter-traverse-of-the-purcells\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-24842","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-uncategorized"],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p2Ncip-6sG","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/24842","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=24842"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/24842\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":25253,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/24842\/revisions\/25253"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=24842"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=24842"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=24842"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
