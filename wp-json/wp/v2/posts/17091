She\u2019s controlled her intermittent migraines with medication and Botox injections since a horse-riding accident. But when she caught COVID-19 in July 2021, the headaches she suffered were \u201cliving hell,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUnlike a migraine related to my TBI, this one descended like a blanket being thrown over my head. It wasn&#8217;t a process of getting a headache. I suddenly had a headache, and it was excruciating,\u201d says Schroeder, a 52-year-old from Knoxville, Tennessee. \u201cA normal migraine for me can be an eight or nine out of 10, with vomiting, light sensitivity, and post-migraine malaise. This headache was a 20 out of 10.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Neither Tylenol nor migraine rescue medications reduced the pain, she says. The headache persisted for two weeks and deprived her of sleep\u2014allowing her only 15 to 45 minutes at a time. \u201cA lot of people I know spent their COVID quarantine watching television or reading,\u201d Schroeder says. \u201cI spent it with a cold pack on my head trying to endure the pain of the headache.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Schroeder is far from alone. In a recent\u00a0review of the research, approximately half of all people with an acute COVID infection developed a headache, and it was the first symptom in about a quarter of people. Despite COVID\u2019s classification as a respiratory disease, about\u00a0one in five patients\u00a0with moderate to severe COVID report that it was the neurological symptoms\u2014including headache, brain fog, and loss of taste and smell\u2014that bothered them the most.<\/p>\n<p>Those percentages are likely an underestimate. \u201cThe reporting of headache varies depending on whether it\u2019s assessed inpatient or outpatient,\u201d says Mia Tova Minen, chief of headache research and a neurologist at New York University Langone Health. \u201cIt\u2019s likely underreported by hospitalized patients in part because there\u2019s so many other symptoms that might be the focus of those patients.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Types of COVID-19 headaches<b>\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>A headache is\u00a0usually an early\u00a0COVID symptom and typically bilateral\u2014occurring on both sides of the head, or the \u201cwhole head,\u201d as some have described it. The pain varies from moderate to severe, but several people told\u00a0<i>National Geographic<\/i>\u00a0that the pain was far worse than with previous headaches; others rated the pain as on par with past migraines. But between\u00a047 and 80 percent\u00a0of people with a history of headaches described their COVID headache as different from past ones\u2014with pain that was both sudden and intense.<\/p>\n<p>Schroeder, for example, says her migraines used to begin slowly, giving her time to reduce light exposure and take medicine. But her COVID headache came on in an instant, and her migraines since her infection aren\u2019t the same. \u201cMy migraines are far less controllable, and in the fall and early spring they were far more frequent than ever before,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>Her husband, Jesse Trucks, also sustained a TBI from sports injuries and, like his wife, had been vaccinated four months before getting COVID-19. He also developed a headache, which he described as distinct from those resulting from his brain injury. \u201cThe pain of the COVID headache was like when the dentist\u2019s drill hits a nerve,\u201d he says. While his headaches typically form a band around the front of his head, his COVID headache instead parked itself at the base of his neck and the back of his head, lasting for 10 days.<\/p>\n<p>The headaches reported by people with acute COVID fall into three main categories, according to Jennifer Frontera, a neurologist at New York University\u2019s Grossman School of Medicine: migraine-like, tension-type, and daily persistent headaches. Each of these correspond to types of headache diagnoses that already exist.<\/p>\n<p>Some people with COVID describe a migraine-like headache, with throbbing on one side of the head, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and light and sound sensitivity.\u00a0Multiple\u00a0studies, however, have identified the most common characteristics of COVID headaches as symptoms similar to those in tension-type headaches, which occur across both sides and have a more \u201crubber band-like restriction across your head,\u201d Frontera says. Between 70 and 80 percent of people say they occur on both sides and the front of their head and describe them as having a \u201cpressing\u201d or \u201ctightening\u201d quality. Light or sound sensitivity and nausea or vomiting, on the other hand, occur in less than half of those with a COVID headache.<\/p>\n<p>But some of these COVID-triggered tension-type headaches have another quality that warrants the third category: they last for days, weeks, or even months. These resemble \u201cnew daily persistent headaches,\u201d a diagnosis for a headache which just doesn\u2019t go away and is often triggered by a viral infection, a medical procedure, a stressful life event, or even a plane ride, Minen says. Although only formally diagnosed as a new daily persistent headache after lasting 90 days, Minen says doctors typically recognize these headaches and may begin treating earlier.<\/p>\n<p>New daily persistent headaches may be less responsive to the standard headache treatments for migraine or traditional tension-type headaches, which has led many headache specialists to link them to the ongoing headaches people describe during a bout of COVID, Minen says.<\/p>\n<p>In\u00a0one study\u00a0of more than 900 COVID patients, their headache lasted a median 14 days, but one in five patients still had it three months later; one in six patients had it nine months later. The worse the headache was during acute infection, the longer people were likely to have it.<\/p>\n<h2>Causes of the COVID-19 headache<\/h2>\n<p>Researchers are still learning about the specific mechanisms of a COVID-19 headache, but some\u00a0possibilities include\u00a0direct injury from the virus, a response to inflammation as the body fights the infection, less oxygen in the blood, dehydration, problems with blood clotting, or issues with the endothelial cells that form the inner layer of blood vessels. None of these, however, explain all COVID headaches.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s probably slightly different mechanisms at play,\u201d Frontera says. \u201cThe most compelling pathological data pertains to microvascular injury,\u201d she says. The negative effects of COVID-19 on blood vessels are well recognized and may affect the\u00a0trigeminal nerve, the largest cranial nerve and the one\u00a0responsible for\u00a0facial sensations and motor activities, such as chewing and swallowing.\u00a0Located near\u00a0the temple in front of the ears on either side of the head, each trigeminal ganglion\u2014a group of nerves\u2014has three branches along the top, middle, and bottom parts of the face.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s an association between headache and loss of sense of smell and taste, so one potential mechanism could be that there\u2019s some sort of damage in that olfactory pathway,\u201d Minen says. \u201cIt could be that COVID is entering through the nose, and there\u2019s inflammation in the nasal cavity. That then activates the trigeminal nerve branches, which can cause headaches.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Laura Johansen, a public health clinical researcher in Charlotte, North Carolina, noticed that the headache she developed when she suffered from COVID-19 in October 2020 \u201caligned almost perfectly with starting to lose my sense of taste and smell, and worsened together in tandem,\u201d a common association in the research. Like most with COVID headaches, hers was concentrated at the top and front of her head.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt felt like a sinus headache met a migraine,\u201d Johansen says. \u201cIt lasted for about four days, and once it set in, it was solidly parked\u2014no ebbs and flows, just continuous ache.\u201d Though she took acetaminophen, she said it didn\u2019t do much.<\/p>\n<p>Acetaminophen is one of the most common treatments doctors offer, as well as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, metamizole, triptans, or a combination of these, but\u00a0only a quarter\u00a0of people report complete relief; only half reported getting any relief from these medications. Minen says headache specialists will often treat tension-type headaches or persistent daily headaches with gabapentin, a medication that\u2019s also used to treat seizures and nerve pain.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCertainly, if you\u2019re not responding to basic over-the-counter pain medications, it\u2019s probably reasonable to make an appointment with a headache specialist,\u201d Frontera says. \u201cOne, to make sure there\u2019s not something else going on, and then to define what type of headache you are having.\u201d Treatments are different for migraine-like headaches versus tension-type or daily persistent headaches, she says.<\/p>\n<h2>Long COVID headaches<\/h2>\n<p>Though COVID-related headaches subside with other symptoms in most people, up to 45 percent of people continue to suffer from the headache after other symptoms wane.<\/p>\n<p>Travis Littlechilds, a systems analyst who lives in London, has had his COVID headache most days for the past four months. His headache during active infection was similar to a migraine, he says, \u201cbut extra sensitive to pressure.\u201d Bending over or coughing was particularly painful. Though his headaches have become less severe, their quality is roughly the same: strong pressure directly in the back of his head that feels worse with movement.<\/p>\n<p>Others with long COVID have\u00a0similarly\u00a0reported\u00a0that the headache they developed during the infection never left. In a\u00a0meta-analysis of 36 studies\u00a0involving more than 28,000 people, the headache lasted up to two months for one in six people and up to three months for one in 10. For 8 percent of patients, the headache lasted at least six months. Most research on COVID headaches doesn\u2019t address whether symptoms differ for vaccinated or unvaccinated people, but at least\u00a0one recent study\u00a0found that for those who were vaccinated or boosted, headaches were among the less severe symptoms.<\/p>\n<p>Those most likely to develop a long COVID headache are people who had a history of headaches, who experienced a headache as their first symptom, whose COVID headache lasted longer than the rest of their COVID symptoms or whose headache didn\u2019t respond to pain medications. Those with post-COVID headaches tend to respond well to the migraine medications\u00a0amitriptyline\u00a0and nortriptyline, Frontera says.<\/p>\n<p>Schroeder, whose illness was primarily her headache and fatigue without any chest tightness or sniffles, was fortunate not to develop a long COVID headache, and she and her husband continue to take precautions to avoid another infection.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI never ever want to have a headache like that again,\u201d she says. \u201cI look back and wonder how I survived the experience. Oddly, I don&#8217;t remember the days well at all \u2026 but I can remember the pain perfectly.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How COVID-19 headaches are different from others\u2014and how to manage them Experts say three types of headaches can occur with coronavirus infection.
