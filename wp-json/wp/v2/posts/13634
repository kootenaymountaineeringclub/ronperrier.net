An unbelievably scenic trail that is almost all alpine meadows.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Note that the trail is out and back, with no junctions &#8211; 11.3 one-way, 22.6km return. Start with a challenging rooty, rocky forested climb that gets you to the open alpine meadows at one km then gives way to 9 kilometres of cruzy alpine single-track &#8211; meadows and occasional light forest patches for pretty well the rest of the way. The trail generally contours around the landscape, over a moderate ascending and descending trail. At its middle, it descends somewhat to Standard Basin, then climbs switchbacks to the other side. For the last part, it descends to an open forest and a cabin on the lake (available for overnight stays).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Although the meadows are blue, many climbs, switchbacks and slope exposure keep this trail black with several steep, gruelling, techy climbs that will have you hiking your bike to the next ribbon of rideable trail. There are burley parts across scree slopes midway through the ride.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The usual turnaround is 11 km in at the Standard Cabin, a backcountry cabin primarily used by snowmobilers in the winter. It is on a small alpine lake surrounded by jagged peaks towering in all directions. Routes continue beyond the cabin to the summit of Standard Peak and beyond. The cabin is open for shelter but this is a pack-in pack-out site.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">From the cabin, turn around and come home the same way. For an end-of-the-day treat, cycle down the logging road to Highway 23 and a fast long descent.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Keystone is a remote alpine trail with no cell coverage and no water. Come prepared for bike failures, rapid weather changes and bear encounters. Please respect the trail and the alpine environment and don&#8217;t ride it when wet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>What to Do:<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Stay in the cabin.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Swim in an alpine lake at the end.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Climb Standard Peak.<\/strong> The \u2018second 11.4 km half\u2019 of the trail to Standard Peak is a fantastic extension to the already mind-blowing trail.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Back on the valley floor, there are plenty of boat launches and stretches of beach along the highway to stop for a swim and cool off, with\u00a0<span class=\"s2\">Martha Creek Provincial Park<\/span>\u00a0the official spot closer to town.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>References:<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">https:\/\/www.trailforks.com\/trails\/keystone-standard-basin\/<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">https:\/\/revelstoketrails.com\/trails\/north-hwy-23\/north-hwy-23-high-elev\/north-hwy-23-high-elev-established\/keystone-standard-basin-trail\/<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Originally a hiking trail, this is now primarily a single-track black diamond mountain biking\/hiking trail.
