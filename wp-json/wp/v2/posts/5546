There is always with the vague fear that teeth will tug on your leg at any moment when swimming in the ocean. Never mind that there\u2019d been only two shark bites on the Connecticut coast since 1900. Facts are never as salient as feelings.<br \/>\nThe only way to find out for yourself is to swim with sharks &#8211; take scuba lessons, go to Tiger Beach in the Bahamas and dive with tiger sharks, the species responsible for more recorded attacks on humans than any shark except the great white. This was the author\u2019s first dive after getting certified, his first dive anywhere other than a swimming pool or a quarry in Maryland\u2014and it would be without a cage. Most people thought he was either very brave or very stupid.<br \/>\nBut he just wanted to puncture an illusion. People who know sharks intimately tend to be the least afraid of them, and no one gets closer to sharks than divers. The divers who run operations at Tiger Beach speak lovingly of the tiger sharks there, the way people talk about their children or their pets. They give them nicknames and light up when they talk about their personality quirks. In their eyes these sharks aren\u2019t man-eaters any more than dogs are. (In fact, they are demonstrably less man-eating: In 2015 there were 34 human fatalities from dog attacks in the United States but just six fatalities from shark attacks worldwide.)<br \/>\nThe business of puncturing illusions is tricky, though, because reality is rarely one simple thing or its simple opposite. The day before his first dive at Tiger Beach, news came from Hawaii that a man had been attacked by a tiger shark so relentless that the man was able to escape only by pulling out the shark\u2019s eyeball. The man\u2019s feet were mangled, and one foot had to be amputated. (His name was Tony Lee, and the author spoke to him a month after the attack. He says he doesn\u2019t think he actually pulled out the whole eyeball, he likely just ruptured it, but it was certainly what made the shark let go. The punch-the-shark-in-the-nose defense? All that got Lee was a fistful of bloody knuckles.) It was one of three attacks off Oahu that month alone and part of an unsettling spike in attacks in recent years that has led Hawaii to commission a study of tiger sharks\u2019 movement patterns.<\/p>\n<p>Tiger sharks are not relevant just because of how many people they bite. As apex predators, they act as a crucial balancing force in ocean ecosystems, constraining the behaviour of animals like sea turtles. As such, they are essential to the health of sea grass ecosystems, which are habitat to a wide array of marine wildlife.<br \/>\nFurthermore, tiger sharks\u2019 role in ocean ecosystems is likely to increase with climate change. If the planet and its oceans continue to warm, some species will be winners and others will be losers, and tiger sharks are likely to be winners. They love warm water, they eat almost anything, and they have large litters of pups. (The small litter size of many other shark species makes them especially vulnerable to overfishing.) Put together, these characteristics make tigers one of the hardiest shark species. They are also among the largest: Mature females can exceed 18 feet and weigh more than 1,200 pounds. Only great whites and a few other shark species are larger.<br \/>\nTiger sharks prefer murky coastal waters but are commonly encountered in the open ocean during seasonal migration. A newborn pup has the distinct striped markings along its three-foot body that give the tiger shark its name. The stripes will fade as the shark ages. Tiger sharks are usually trailed by remoras, which conserve energy by attaching themselves to the shark and feeding off scraps of its prey and parasites on its skin.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tiger Beach<\/strong><br \/>\nTiger sharks in the protected waters of the Bahamas are relatively safe, but tigers rarely stay in one place for long. Their migrations often put them in the crosshairs of commercial fishermen. Though more than 70 shark species are in worse shape than tiger sharks, conservationists still classify them as \u201cnear threatened.\u201d<br \/>\nTiger Beach is not actually a beach. It\u2019s a shallow bank about 25 miles north of Grand Bahama Island, a patchwork of sand, sea grass, and coral reef that began attracting divers about a decade ago. It\u2019s prime habitat for tiger sharks and has ideal conditions for viewing them. The water is 20 to 45 feet deep and usually crystal clear. You strap on a bunch of weight, sink to the bottom, and watch the sharks go by. As easy as the diving is from a technical standpoint, though, it\u2019s usually something divers work up to.<br \/>\nAfter the two-hour boat ride to the site the morning of the first dive, our dive operators started tossing bloody chunks of fish overboard. Almost immediately the water filled with Caribbean reef sharks\u2014dozens of them, mostly five-to-seven-footers, swarming and fighting over the fish bits. Then lemon sharks\u2014a little longer and thinner than the reef sharks\u2014appeared here and there, and at last a huge dark silhouette, a tiger. A diver jumped in with a crate of mackerel to begin feeding the shark on the seafloor\u2014in part to occupy it while the rest of us entered the water, and in part to make sure it wasn\u2019t too hungry when we did. He reached the bottom and immediately had to fend off the first tiger shark he\u2019d ever laid eyes on, all 800 pounds of it.<br \/>\nThis was just \u201cSophie\u201d being curious and friendly. \u201cShe loooved you,\u201d Debbie said again and again, because of all the attention Sophie paid me during the dive (really, she was all over me). At the time I wasn\u2019t sure if Sophie loved me like a pal or loved me like a pizza, and I was like an overzealous ninja with the three-foot plastic pole I carried to keep the sharks at arm\u2019s length. But after watching how the divers handled them over the next week\u2019s dives\u2014caressing them after feeding them a fish, steering them gently away when it was time for them to move on\u2014it became easy to see the sharks in a very benign light. Not once did they make a sudden or aggressive move toward anyone; they moved slowly and deliberately, swimming in large loops and then coming on a glide path to the feeding box, and I felt surprisingly safe in their presence. The taxi ride from the Freeport airport felt more dangerous than diving with these sharks did.<br \/>\nMost of the tiger sharks at Tiger Beach are habituated to divers, used to being fed and to not biting the hands that feed them. But even the ones that aren\u2019t familiar with the routine\u2014and we had one of those during our first day diving\u2014generally are not dangerous to divers. Tiger sharks are ambush predators, relying on stealth and surprise to catch their prey. At Tiger Beach you\u2019re not blindly paddling or swimming at the surface of the water, like most attack victims. You\u2019re down at the sharks\u2019 level, presenting yourself as something other than prey\u2014and that makes diving with them reasonably safe.<br \/>\nBut not safer than that. There are videos of near misses at Tiger Beach\u2014one in which a tiger shark tries to chomp a diver\u2019s head and another in which a tiger goes after a diver\u2019s leg\u2014and there was a fatality here in 2014, when a diver simply disappeared. Our group even had a scare when an angelfish wandered into our midst and the reef sharks and lemon sharks went into a frenzy, chasing it as it hid between people\u2019s legs. (I had my turn in the shark tornado, trying to fend off the sharks as they whipped around me and crashed into my legs, and it was as unnerving as you\u2019d think.) Everyone, including Debbie, thought someone was going to be bitten in the melee, and there were three half-ton tiger sharks milling around that might suddenly have taken an interest in a flailing, wounded diver.<br \/>\nThe incident was a fluke, and we were back in the water the next day. But it was the kind of fluke that reminds you that sharks are wild animals, and Tiger Beach is a wild place, and wild animals and wild places are inherently unpredictable. And according to scientists who study them, tigers are especially unpredictable.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Oahu Hawaii<\/strong><br \/>\nIn Oahu, the University of Hawaii has tagged hundreds of tiger sharks with satellite tags and acoustic tracking devices, and they\u2019re just beginning to understand the animals.<br \/>\nThe movements of most shark species are fairly predictable, they\u2019ll go one place during the day, and one place at night. But for the most part that is not seen that with tiger sharks. They can show up any time of day or night, and they may be there one day and back the next day, or there one day and then gone for three years. At least some of this unpredictability is likely caused by the sharks\u2019 hunting habits. As ambush predators, tiger sharks rely on surprise to catch their prey, and if you\u2019re predictable, your prey is going to adapt to that predictability. So it makes sense to suddenly appear in an area and not be there very long.<br \/>\nIt isn\u2019t known why attacks in Hawaii have spiked in recent years, jumping from an average of fewer than four a year from 2000 to 2011 to almost 10 a year from 2012 to 2015. One would expect to see a long-term rise in attacks because of the increasing number of people in Hawaii\u2019s waters.ENLARGE<br \/>\nAs for why attacks occur mostly in the fall, that\u2019s when tiger sharks come to the main islands to give birth. Female tiger sharks make a huge energy investment when they ovulate. Their eggs are enormous \u2014the size of baseballs\u2014and they can have as many as 80 pups in a litter. What that might mean \u2014 although it\u2019s a completely untested hypothesis \u2014 is that pregnant sharks get to the islands hungry, and this makes them even more indiscriminate eaters than usual. But the uptick in attacks in the fall, a pattern noticed by native Hawaiians for generations (surfers call it Sharktober), might also be a function of having more sharks around the islands at that time of year.<br \/>\nBesides Hawaii\u2019s growing human population, another possible factor is a proliferation of sea turtles. Green sea turtles received federal protection in 1978, after decades of intense exploitation. Their numbers have been increasing ever since. They\u2019re now common off Hawaii\u2019s shores and are a familiar food for tiger sharks.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sea Turtles<\/strong><br \/>\nTiger sharks and sea turtles have a long, shared history. They both hark back to the dinosaur age, and the fossil record suggests they may have evolved in tandem. With wide jaws and heavy, angled teeth that resemble old-style can openers, tiger sharks are able to crush and slice through an adult turtle\u2019s shell in a way most sharks can\u2019t. This robust morphology might help explain the tiger\u2019s famously unselective eating habits. Tires, license plates, paint cans, farm animals, unexploded munitions, a suit of armour\u2014all these things have been found in tiger sharks\u2019 stomachs, proving they\u2019re willing to bite just about anything first (apparently with minimal adverse effects) and worry about edibility later. So if more turtles are sharing the water with more people, more shark bites might be the result.<br \/>\nBut this is where the story becomes much more than just a \u201cshark bites man\u201d story, because the relationship between tiger sharks and sea turtles could have broad implications for the health of ocean ecosystems around the globe. On a remote part of Australia\u2019s western coast called Shark Bay, it has been documented how tiger sharks prevent sea turtles and dugongs (sea cows) from overgrazing the sea grass beds that anchor the ecosystem. It\u2019s not just by eating the animals, the mere presence of the sharks changes the turtles\u2019 and dugongs\u2019 habits, creating a \u201clandscape of fear\u201d that forces them to graze more judiciously in order to lessen their risk of being eaten.<br \/>\nWhat this means is that protecting animals like sea turtles without also protecting the predators that keep them in check could lead to degraded ocean ecosystems. If you look at places where shark populations have declined and turtle populations are protected\u2014places like Bermuda\u2014it looks like those areas are having losses in their sea grass.<\/p>\n<p>In the Bahamas, which prohibited longline fishing in 1993 and designated its waters a shark sanctuary in 2011, the marine ecosystems are relatively healthy. But the adjacent western Atlantic, which includes Bermuda, has much weaker shark protections and appears to be suffering the consequences. Sea turtles there don\u2019t seem to alter their behavior in response to tiger sharks the way the turtles in Shark Bay do, and that might be because Atlantic tiger shark populations are already significantly compromised. Comparing Florida and the Bahamas, it\u2019s night and day, with massive differences in the size and numbers of the sharks. They\u2019re doing well in the Bahamas, but you almost never catch them off Florida. And they\u2019re just 50 miles apart. Florida prohibited the killing of tiger sharks in its waters in 2012, but it\u2019s the only state on the eastern seaboard to have done so, and federal law allows them to be caught and killed in U.S. waters, within certain limits, by commercial and recreational fishermen.<br \/>\nJaws isn&#8217;t responsible for most of the threats tiger sharks face\u2014coastal development, marine pollution, longline fishing, the popularity of shark fin soup\u2014but it did create a cultural attitude that has had a remarkably long shelf life. After Jaws, people didn\u2019t just become paranoid about sharks; they became callous, even vengeful. In the 1970s and \u201980s, shark-fishing tournaments sprouted like weeds on the eastern seaboard of the U.S., and dozens of them continue, celebrating the spectacle of \u201cmonster sharks\u201d hanging on the docks. <\/p>\n<p>Sharks can be scary, that\u2019s true. Mike Coots, a photographer from Kauai lost half his right leg to a tiger shark while bodyboarding in 1997, when he was 18. He was soon back in the water and says he almost never thinks about sharks when he\u2019s surfing. Hawaii is an ocean culture. People here are in the water from the time they\u2019re in diapers. They\u2019re just not that afraid of sharks.<br \/>\nIn the summer of 2015, hysteria about recent shark attacks in North Carolina was in full bloom and news broke that an 800-pound tiger shark had been caught off the South Carolina coast. USA Today called the shark \u201cmonstrous\u201d and described the fishermen as \u201cbrave souls.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Glenn Hodges June 2016 National Geographic America loved Jaws, and became paranoid about sharks.
