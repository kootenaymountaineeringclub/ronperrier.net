It is not necessary to get out of your car as it drops off a 25m cliff beside Broadwater Road just after Scotty\u2019s Marina.<br \/>\nThis is a seasonal waterfall that typically dries up in the summer. It\u2019s primary attraction for most people is a minor rock climb to the right of the falls.<br \/>\nBut the real magic is the creek itself. In the early 1990\u2019s, the entire Allendale Creek was involved in a landslide caused by a road drainage diversion. Broadwater Road was blocked for several days.<br \/>\nThis resulted in the granite creek bed being scoured clean of all soil and debris for several hundred meters. As it is south facing and right on Arrow Lakes, the snow melts here possibly earlier than anywhere else in the West Kootenay. Early in season, there can be a fair amount of water in the creek but later, it is often dry and makes for a wonderful scramble.<br \/>\nI lived in the Green House for a few years in the mid 90s and walked up the scoured creek many times for exercise.\u00a0<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Location:<\/strong> Along Arrow Lakes 15kms west of the Columbia River Bridge and 5kms past the Hugh Keenleyside Dam.
