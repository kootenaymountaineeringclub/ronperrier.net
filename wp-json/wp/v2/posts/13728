They were built to accommodate the wheat and grain crops expected from the Creston flats once they were reclaimed, a project also took place in 1935. Farmers sold their grain to the elevator, which then distributed it to markets in other parts of the country and to destinations around the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Doukobor Cultural Centre<\/strong><i>,<\/i> Castlegar.

This unusual roadside attraction on the east side of Kootenay Lake was built from over half a million discarded embalming fluid bottles. In 1952, David H. Brown retired from 35 years in the funeral business. It occurred to Brown that there should be some practical use to put the bottles to. It is built in a cloverleaf patter with three main rooms, circular shape, 48 feet in length, 24 feet wide and with the upstairs room, it contains 1,200 sq. ft. of floor space. Over 320 doze flowers border pathways and entice visitors from the terrace over a bridge also built of glass bottles. A winding path beneath the bridge leads to a rocky lakeshore and a lookout called the \u2018lighthouse\u2019 offers spectacular views of Kootenay Lake.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/www.kootenayrockies.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/KR%20Blog%20-%20Quirky%20Attractions%20-%20Glass%20House%20-%20Don%20Weixl.jpg\" width=\"636\" height=\"425\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Nikkei Internment Centre<\/strong>, New Denver. During World War II, over 20,000 Japanese Canadians were forcibly relocated from the coast to remove internment camps. The Nikkei Internment Memorial Centre is located on the side of one of ten such camps in the Slocan Valley (near New Denver) and is dedicated to the preservation of the physical history and personal memories of Japanese Canadian internees. It is the only interpretive site of its kind in Canada and contains original internment shacks and a large hand-carved Buddhist shrine that was built by a temple carpenter during the war. A beautiful commemorative garden has been created by master gardener and former internee Mr. Roy Sumi.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Castlegar\u2019s<\/strong>\u00a0<b><strong>Sculpturewalk\u00a0<\/strong><\/b>features sculptures by local and international talented artists, located on a pleasant walking tour.
