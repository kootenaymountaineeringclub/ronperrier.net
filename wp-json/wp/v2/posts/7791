You only see forest until the top when Nelson and Kootenay Lake opens up in front of you.<br \/>\nPulpit Rock is on the tip of the south ridge of Mt Nelson &#8211; or Elephant Mountain or &#8220;the Dome&#8221; &#8211; as most Nelsonites call it. The height is very deceptive when viewed from Nelson &#8211; it is a 3500-foot climb in total and 1500 feet from the flag pole to the CBC Communication tower.<br \/>\nIf traversing Elephant Mountain, arrange a shuttle from the other end or have two parties that meet at the top to exchange keys.<br \/>\nBob Dean did a tremendous amount of work on this trail over the years. Leon Arishnikoff carried a chainsaw up the ridge many times to clear the frequent deadfall. A bench in memory of Leon is on the flagpole trail.\u00a0<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Rating: \u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666<br \/>\nDifficulty:<\/strong> Easy A1 to Pulpit Rock, C1 difficult to the CBC towers at the summit.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Elevation gain:<\/strong> 300m (984&#8242;); 1066m (3500&#8242;) to the Summitt.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Key elevations:<\/strong> Park 580m (1902&#8242;), Pulpit Rock 880m (2886&#8242;); The Flagpole Summit 1220 m.
