The state is roughly 82.2% of the size of its southwest neighbor, the nation of\u00a0Bolivia. A state with a flat landscape that alternates between vast\u00a0<em>chapadas<\/em>\u00a0and plain areas, Mato Grosso contains three main ecosystems: the\u00a0Cerrado, the\u00a0Pantanal\u00a0and the\u00a0Amazon rainforest. Open pasture vegetation covers 40% of the state.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Chapada dos Guimar\u00e3es National Park, with caves, grottoes, tracks, and waterfalls, is one of its tourist attractions. In the north is the biodiverse Amazonian forest, which originally covered half of the state. Much of this has been disrupted and cleared for logging, agricultural purposes and pastures. The\u00a0Xingu Indigenous Park\u00a0and the\u00a0Araguaia River\u00a0are in Mato Grosso. Farther south, the\u00a0Pantanal, the world&#8217;s largest\u00a0wetland, is the habitat for nearly one thousand species of animals and many aquatic birds.<br \/>\nThe biologically rich\u00a0Pantanal, one of the world&#8217;s largest wetland\/prairie ecosystems, is also located within this state. Much environmental degradation has occurred to the Pantanal since the late 20th century because of development, and efforts to contain or slow it have had limited success. The Pantanal has a habitat similar to that of the\u00a0Everglades\u00a0in Florida in the United States, although the Pantanal is on a much larger scale.<br \/>\n<strong>History.<\/strong> The\u00a0Bororo\u00a0Indians live in the Mato Grosso area. As late as 1880, soldiers patrolled lands on the outskirts of\u00a0Cuiab\u00e1, Mato Grosso&#8217;s capital and largest city, to protect settlers from Bororo raids. By the end of the 19th century, although severely reduced by disease and by warfare with explorers,\u00a0slave traders,\u00a0prospectors,\u00a0settlers, and other\u00a0indigenous groups, as many as five to 10 thousand Bororo continued to occupy central and eastern Mato Grosso, as well as western\u00a0Goi\u00e1s.\u00a0The southwestern part of this state was ceded by Brazil to\u00a0Bolivia\u00a0in exchange for the then-Bolivian territory of\u00a0Acre, according to the\u00a0Treaty of Petr\u00f3polis\u00a0in 1903.<br \/>\nThis historically remote area attracted expeditions of exploration in the early 20th century that sought to find lost civilizations. A notable example was British Captain\u00a0Percy Fawcett&#8217;s expedition to find the\u00a0Lost City of Z\u00a0which he believed existed in the jungles of Brazil. Certain proponents of the\u00a0Hollow Earth\u00a0hypothesis speculated that the region had sites of access to the interior of the earth and its settlements.<br \/>\nIn 1977, the state was split into two halves, and the neighboring state of\u00a0Mato Grosso do Sul\u00a0was created from the other part of its territory.<br \/>\n<strong>Demographics.<\/strong>\u00a0Mato Grosso had a high rate of population growth in the 20th century due to timber, ranching, and agricultural development. The state as a whole has one of the lowest population densities of any Brazilian state. According to the\u00a0Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics\u00a0(IBGE), 3,441,998 people resided in the state as of 2018. The population density was 3.8 inhabitants\/km<sup>2<\/sup>.<br \/>\nEthnically, the state includes a relatively high proportion of\u00a0caboclos\u00a0(persons of mixed European and Indian ancestry), as do other areas of interior Brazil. The last PNAD (National Research for Sample of Domiciles) census revealed the following numbers: 1,532,000\u00a0Brown\u00a0(Mixed) people (50.92%); 1,179,000\u00a0White\u00a0people (39.16%); 239,000\u00a0Black\u00a0people (7.93%); 41,000\u00a0Amerindian\u00a0people (1.37%); and 14,000\u00a0Asian\u00a0people (0.45%).<br \/>\n<strong>Economy.<\/strong> Agriculture\u00a0is the largest component of the state&#8217;s\u00a0GDP\u00a0at 40.8%, followed by the\u00a0service sector\u00a0at 40.2%. The\u00a0industrial sector\u00a0represents 19% of the GDP (2004). Mato Grosso&#8217;s major exports include\u00a0soybeans\u00a0(83%),\u00a0wood\u00a0(5.6%),\u00a0meats\u00a0(4.8%), and\u00a0cotton\u00a0(3.3%) (2002).<br \/>\nIn 2020, Mato Grosso was the leader in the national grain production, with 28.0%.<sup>[8]<\/sup>\u00a0It&#8217;s the largest producer of\u00a0soy\u00a0in Brazil, with 26.9% of the total produced in 2020 (33.0 million tons); the largest producer of\u00a0maize\u00a0in the country;\u00a0the largest producer of\u00a0cotton\u00a0in Brazil, with around 65% of national production (1.8 out of the 2.8 million tons harvested in the country).;<sup>[10][11]<\/sup>\u00a0the sixth largest producer of\u00a0sugarcane\u00a0in the country, 16 million tons harvested in the 2019\/20 harvest.;\u00a0and the third-largest producer of\u00a0beans, with 10.5% of Brazilian production.<br \/>\nIn 2019, the cattle herd from Mato Grosso reached the mark of 30 million cattle, the largest cattle herd in the country, representing almost 14% of national production alone. In 2018, Mato Grosso was the fifth largest pork producer in the country, with a herd of around 2.5 million animals.<br \/>\nIn 2017, Mato Grosso had 1.15% of the national mineral participation &#8211; gold,\u00a0tin,\u00a0gemstones (diamond, having extracted 49,000 carats in the year 2017<br \/>\n<strong>Culture.<\/strong> The local culture is very rich due to the influences of and encounters with various cultures, such as indigenous peoples, colonial Spanish and other European settlers, Africans enslaved and transported there in the\u00a0Atlantic slave trade, originally by the\u00a0Portuguese, and other Europeans; and immigrants and settlers since the late 19th century.<br \/>\nThe four-day period before\u00a0Lent\u00a0leading up to\u00a0Ash Wednesday, known as\u00a0Carnival, is well celebrated.

Brazilian buses are quite unlike Canadian Greyhound buses as they have almost completely reclining and comfortable seats.

Barao do Melgaco and Porto Jofre, in the North, and Corumba, Porto Manga, Passo da Lontra, in the South, are also key regional references.<br \/>\n<strong>The Best Time To Visit The Pantanal.<\/strong> The\u00a0rainy season goes from November to March.\u00a0During it, the rain is intense, the temperatures are high and the Pantanal gets flooded. This is the nesting time for many species of birds, and the period when many mammals retreat and seek refuge in the high terraces of the plains. Obviously,\u00a0that&#8217;s not the ideal time to visit the Pantanal. \u00a0Avoid it.<br \/>\nThe best time to visit the area is the dry season: April to September, or a little later\u00a0in the Cuiab\u00e1 region (one or two months later in the northern parts of the Pantanal). Since we can\u2019t be sure of the exact weather patterns in a specific year, and since the dry season can begin later in the year or end earlier, it may be a better option to avoid transitional months (April\u2026).<br \/>\nIn most years the\u00a0water levels start to recede in April, and fish become trapped in puddles and small lakes, which attracts birds. And that\u2019s when the great opportunities for bird watching begins (and the best time to visit the area also begins).<br \/>\nTemperatures and humidity\u00a0also matter: The climate is very hot and humid in the summer (rain season) but average low temperatures drop to much lower levels (around 70\u00baF\/21\u00b0C) during the\u00a0dry season.

This is the major ecological attraction in Brazil. It is a lowland in western central Brazil that varies in elevation by only 1-2 meters. During the rainy season, it is inundated with water-producing patches of dry land where animals cluster producing an enormously rich feeding ground (650 bird species and 80 different mammals). The rainy season is from October to March and the water rises in the Pantanal as much as 3m above dry season levels \u2013 in March in northern Pantanal and as late as June in the south which is accessed from Campo Grande. The hot tourist spot is Bonito, a 5-hour bus ride from here but I had already arranged a 3-day tour with Gils Pantanal Discovery.<br \/>\nI was met at the bus depot and driven to the hotel for a nice breakfast and then a hot 4 hour drive into the Pantanal to a lodge on the side of the Miranda River. We went on a truck safari where we saw howler monkeys, capybara (the largest rodent in the world), coatis, caiman alligators, brock deer, fox, raccoon, and many kinds of birds. Normally there would be a metre of water everywhere but now it was completely dry (the guide thought that it has been drier for the last 5 years and he thought it was because of deforestation and subsequent soybean planting). Cattle are the major economy here. That night an incredible lightning storm lit up the eastern sky with flashes at least every second for over an hour. The next day was a horse ride which was very lame as no galloping was allowed. We saw white-lipped peccaries, rheas, storks, hyacinths macaws, toucans, and many more birds. That afternoon was a long-boat ride along the river to see many capybaras, caiman, swamp deer, giant river otters, kingfishers, and more birds. The next day was piranha fishing where we caught 7 and had them for dinner (very bony). Jaguar are fairly common but not often seen as they are nocturnal.
