The twentieth century was a time of intensifying resource use as towns were established and the population grew.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The expanse of land that is now Darkwoods first became a property in 1897 when it was named a Crown grant to the Nelson &amp; Sheppard Railway. The property passed through the hands of six different resource companies until 1967, when it was bought by a German Duke. Many years ago, as the cold war stalked Europe, a German duke looked westward for a haven for his family. He found it in British Columbia &#8212; in an immense tract of land he called Darkwoods. The Duke fell in love with Darkwoods and its towering mountains, cool water, trees of all shapes and sizes and animals that roamed freely through the abundant land&#8230;<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">For the next 40 years, the Duke&#8217;s forestry company, Pluto Darkwoods, maintained a European-style sustainable forestry operation on the property. The company&#8217;s efforts to minimize the impact of the timber harvest on the overall health of the forest allowed the property to retain much of its ecological value.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The years passed, and as the Duke grew older, the time came to\u00a0entrust the land to new owners. He searched for someone who\u00a0would keep Darkwoods in one piece, and protect its ecological\u00a0treasures. They must cherish the land as he had. The Duke chose\u00a0the Nature Conservancy of Canada (NCC) as the next in line to\u00a0steward Darkwoods into the future.<br \/>\nIn April 2008, the Nature Conservancy of Canada (NCC) purchased the Darkwoods lands from Pluto Darkwoods Forestry Corporation in the\u00a0<strong>largest single private land purchase for conservation in Canadian history<\/strong>.<br \/>\nOn July 1, 2009, Darkwoods became the BC Region&#8217;s 8th annual Gift to Canadians. Rarely does private property of this size and ecological richness become available for conservation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">For many years, the Duke had run a small-scale sustainable timber\u00a0harvest under his company, the Pluto Darkwoods Corporation.\u00a0It was modelled after progressive forestry practices in Europe.\u00a0Despite the timber harvest, this ecosystem still maintains a lot of<br \/>\nimportant natural values \u2013 and there aren\u2019t a lot of places like that\u00a0\u00a0in these parts. It encompasses everything that comes to\u00a0mind when you think about the Rocky Mountains and Canada \u2013\u00a0fresh air, snow caps, sparkling water, grizzly bears, old-growth\u00a0trees&#8230; the works.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">NCC\u2019s founders had big dreams for protecting nature, but one\u00a0wonders if they ever imagined anything like Darkwoods. The\u00a0securement of Darkwoods wouldn\u2019t have been possible five years\u00a0ago. NCC just didn\u2019t have the\u00a0capacity and the relationships in place to do it. But now, we\u2019ve\u00a0reached the point where we can work simultaneously at all levels \u2013nationally, provincially and locally\u2013 and that enables us to be\u00a0proactive with spectacular opportunities like these. Who knows\u00a0what we could do in another 10, 15 or 20 years?\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Conservative estimates suggest that over two million tonnes\u00a0of carbon are stored in Darkwoods. If released, this would be equal\u00a0to the CO2 emissions of almost 500,000 Canadians.\u00a0Already, the conservation of Darkwoods has many researchers\u00a0excited about the opportunities it offers. NCC has been approached\u00a0by teams of scientists who are interested in projects such as\u00a0conducting silviculture trials at low and high elevations, understanding\u00a0the impact of protecting under-represented ecosystems or\u00a0examining old-growth habitat and the role it plays\u00a0in carbon sequestration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">As with all NCC properties, securing the land is\u00a0only the first part of the challenge. The next step is\u00a0to develop a comprehensive management plan to\u00a0care for the land on an ongoing basis, with the help\u00a0of local par tners. These stewardship plans are\u00a0varied and dynamic, evolving with the changing\u00a0needs of the property. Pat Field will be working\u00a0with NCC staff and the local community to develop\u00a0a management plan for Darkwoods. \u201cWe have\u00a0the opportunity to prove we can be leaders in\u00a0developing a conservation economy that will\u00a0protect the area\u2019s biodiversity, including its unique\u00a0Mountain Caribou.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Darkwoods Public Access<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Darkwoods has a long history of use by local communities. Since the 1960s, the public has been allowed limited access to the property with a permit, and NCC is happy to continue that tradition and even expand those opportunities. At the same time, the land cannot support all uses, at all times, in all places and retain its special character. Some reasonable limits are required.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>When you can visit<\/strong>.\u00a0Darkwoods is an unmaintained wilderness area open to the public from July through September.
