The provincial park was established in 1995 as 7,888 hectares of coastal temperate rainforest and foreshore ecosystem within Clayoquot Sound Biosphere Reserve. It lies south of Nootka Sound and north of Clayoquot Sound. It includes old growth stands of Sitka spruce, western red cedar and hemlock. Several species at risk including the marbled murrelet, sea otter, grey whale, Stellar sea lion and northern abalone fine refuge here. The park is also home to aboriginal whaling sites, coastline where the first Europeans explored British Columbia and a heritage lighthouse, the only place in Canada attacked by the Japanese in WWII.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"product-single__photo product-single__photo-12126590664776 lazyautosizes lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1094\/4172\/products\/206-01-Hesquiat_300x300.jpg?v=1564162471\" sizes=\"565px\" srcset=\"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1094\/4172\/products\/206-01-Hesquiat_180x.jpg?v=1564162471 180w, \/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1094\/4172\/products\/206-01-Hesquiat_360x.jpg?v=1564162471 360w, \/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1094\/4172\/products\/206-01-Hesquiat_590x.jpg?v=1564162471 590w, \/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1094\/4172\/products\/206-01-Hesquiat_720x.jpg?v=1564162471 720w, \/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1094\/4172\/products\/206-01-Hesquiat_900x.jpg?v=1564162471 900w, \/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1094\/4172\/products\/206-01-Hesquiat_1080x.jpg?v=1564162471 1080w, \/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1094\/4172\/products\/206-01-Hesquiat_1296x.jpg?v=1564162471 1296w, \/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1094\/4172\/products\/206-01-Hesquiat_1512x.jpg?v=1564162471 1512w, \/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1094\/4172\/products\/206-01-Hesquiat_1728x.jpg?v=1564162471 1728w, \/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1094\/4172\/products\/206-01-Hesquiat_2048x.jpg?v=1564162471 2048w\" alt=\"206 Hesquiat Peninsula Coast and Trail Map\" data-widths=\"[180, 360, 590, 720, 900, 1080, 1296, 1512, 1728, 2048]\" data-aspectratio=\"1.3333333333333333\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-image-id=\"12126590664776\" data-srcset=\"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1094\/4172\/products\/206-01-Hesquiat_180x.jpg?v=1564162471 180w, \/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1094\/4172\/products\/206-01-Hesquiat_360x.jpg?v=1564162471 360w, \/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1094\/4172\/products\/206-01-Hesquiat_590x.jpg?v=1564162471 590w, \/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1094\/4172\/products\/206-01-Hesquiat_720x.jpg?v=1564162471 720w, \/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1094\/4172\/products\/206-01-Hesquiat_900x.jpg?v=1564162471 900w, \/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1094\/4172\/products\/206-01-Hesquiat_1080x.jpg?v=1564162471 1080w, \/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1094\/4172\/products\/206-01-Hesquiat_1296x.jpg?v=1564162471 1296w, \/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1094\/4172\/products\/206-01-Hesquiat_1512x.jpg?v=1564162471 1512w, \/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1094\/4172\/products\/206-01-Hesquiat_1728x.jpg?v=1564162471 1728w, \/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1094\/4172\/products\/206-01-Hesquiat_2048x.jpg?v=1564162471 2048w\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Getting There and Away.<\/strong> Floatplanes from Tofino are not only the fastest and most affordable way to reach the park, but the only way as boats don&#8217;t seem to run this far.<br \/>\nFrom Tofino: Atleo River Air Service (atleoair.com).

Homais Cove is another great spot to camp for the night, featuring more interesting rocky outcrops and tide pools.<br \/>\n<strong>Perez Rocks<\/strong>. Named after Spanish explorer Lieutenant Commander Juan Perez, the first European to sail these waters aboard the frigate Santiago in 1774, four years before British Captain James Cook.

Hopscotch from one slippery mound to the next. Other obstacles include lumpy marsh and massive piles of driftwood to avoid the rising tide.<br \/>\n<strong>Estevan Point Lighthouse<\/strong>. Named for Perez\u2019s second Lieutenant, Esteban Jose Martinez. A Japanese submarine fired shells at the lighthouse on June 20, 1942, the first attack on Canadian soil since the War of 1812. There are also various conspiracy theories about who actually did the shelling back then. Some attribute the firing to US or Canadian vessels as an attempt to get Canada to enter the war in the Pacific. As a result of the shelling Canadian war bonds sold at a great rate and a few months later Canada committed troops to the war effort in the Pacific.<br \/>\nBuilt in 1909, the 30m tall lighthouse is manned.

It is clogged with trees and makes a poor alternative route.<br \/>\n<strong>Billion Boulder Beach.\u00a0<\/strong>Past the lighthouse is tedious going across boulders of varying sizes. This stretch is about 7 kms long and there are no camping areas until <strong>Smokehouse Bay<\/strong> (has a small stream for water) before Matlahaw Point on the SE corner of the Peninsula.\u00a0Pass Smokehouse Bay, round <strong>Matlahaw Point<\/strong> (another potential camp site) and head north away from the exposed Pacific into Hesquiat Harbour and <strong>Hesquiat Village<\/strong>. The only inhabitants in 2015 were Ignace and Dave, a couple who has lived here since 1975. The have a \u201cstore\u201d selling homemade tequila fudge and mirrors lined with sea shells. A humpback whale vertebrae found here was radiocarbon dated to 1,500 years old. Pay to camp? Bring money for the store and camping.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DAY 4. Hesquiat Village to Le Claire Point<\/strong><br \/>\nFinally the boulders give way to sandy beach after Antons Spit.<br \/>\nA stream pools up and creates a trench that cuts the beach in two. Wait for the\u00a0 tide to recede (and even then you may have to hoist your packs over your head and wade through chest deep water).<\/p>\n<p><strong>DAY 5. Le Claire Point to Cougar Annie\u2019s Garden <\/strong>4.6 miles<br \/>\nFollow two trails, the longest about 600m, through the forest up and over fallen trees and through sopping wet foliage before returning to the beach. Cross another tidal creek that may require wading up to your chest. The final short leg is a difficult stretch of shoreline leading toward Boat Basin.<br \/>\nFirst encounter a funky collection of wood cabins owned by Peter Buckland, a retired businessman who once owned Cougar Annie\u2019s property.

She arrived with the first of her four husbands to save him from an\u00a0opium\u00a0addiction and ensure that the remittance cheques that came from his family in\u00a0Scotland\u00a0would continue to arrive. At the time she and her husband settled on the coast, they had three small children. She gave birth to eight more children in this remote location. She acquired her nickname because of her famed marksmanship. She shot dozens of\u00a0cougars\u00a0during her long life.<img decoding=\"async\" id=\"p_lt_ctl09_pageplaceholder_p_lt_ctl03_BasicRepeater1_ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_widget1_ctl00_img\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.canadashistory.ca\/getmedia\/889e2103-0030-48e3-aa64-5cd2e12a1159\/ExpWomCougarAnnieGun.jpg.aspx?width=768&amp;height=511&amp;ext=.jpg\" alt=\"Black and white photograph\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Stories<\/strong><br \/>\nAfter the death of her first husband Willie Rae-Arthur in 1936, she advertised in\u00a0The Western Producer\u00a0saying &#8220;BC Widow with Nursery and orchard wishes partner. Widower preferred. Object matrimony.&#8221;\u00a0The new husband she chose from several candidates died at their home in 1944 of an accidental gunshot wound to the leg. The story goes he was cleaning his gun and didn&#8217;t realize that there was a cartridge still in the chamber. Her third husband was produced by the same advertisement, and after his death of pneumonia in 1955, she ran another ad, this time seeking a widower with young children. Her own children having grown and moved off, she found a companion who stayed on with his children for a number of months before the remoteness of life in Boat Basin drove him away. However they did remain in contact for many years to come. (This previous statement has never been verified by the family.) In 1961 Annie married for the fourth and last time. It was an unsuccessful marriage to a man, 12 years her junior, who drank, stole from the store and sometimes beat her. This man tried to run Annie off a cliff to get the farm but she was wilier than he was and ran him off with her shotgun. When he left never to return around 1967, he was not missed.<br \/>\nIn 1942 the lighthouse at\u00a0Estevan Point\u00a0was\u00a0shelled by a Japanese submarine. Annie claimed to have seen the\u00a0submarine\u00a0surface in the harbour before the\u00a0lighthouse\u00a0was shelled and to have found a shell on the beach in front of her land.<br \/>\n<strong>The garden<br \/>\n<\/strong>With little help, Annie cleared 5 acres (20,000\u00a0m2) of her land and planted a sprawling garden. The garden was a source of income throughout her life, as she sold bulbs and plants by mail. She also operated a general store and post office from her plot of land. Another source of income over the years was a bounty offered for\u00a0Cougars\u00a0that ranged from $10 to $40. The numbers of cats that she claimed to have killed continued to increase into her old age but in 1955 she received bounties for 10 cats. At that time she claimed to have killed 62 cougars and about 80\u00a0bears. She killed the cougars and bears because they preyed on the\u00a0goats\u00a0and\u00a0chickens\u00a0that she raised.<br \/>\nHer livelihood depended upon the regular visits of the Canadian Pacific Steamships Line\u00a0Princess Maquinna\u00a0that arrived every 10 days in Hesquiat Harbour from 1913 to 1952 on her rounds from\u00a0Victoria\u00a0to\u00a0Port Alice.<br \/>\nAnnie rarely left the property where she lived until well into her nineties. Ailing and mostly blind, she was removed to\u00a0Port Alberni, where she died at the age of 97.<br \/>\n<strong>The garden recovered.\u00a0<\/strong>Her friend Peter Buckland, a retired Vancouver stockbroker, bought the property from her estate in 1985 and spent nearly fifteen years restoring the garden. He established the non-profit Boat Basin Foundation to manage the garden, which built and in 2007 opened the Temperate Rainforest Field Study Centre on a ridge overlooking the garden, in partnership with\u00a0Ecotrust Canada\u00a0and the\u00a0Hesquiaht First Nation. In August 2010, the property was listed for sale, the study centre having been found to be not financially viable. NOTE: The sale of this property has been halted due to the &#8220;unmarked&#8221; cemetery, including Ada&#8217;s ashes and her first husband Willie. Family members and Peter Buckland were shown by Ada where most of the graves are, as Ada never put up a marker, she just planted something nice on top.<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/daveandjackierun.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/07\/hotsprings1-034.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1371\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; background: white; border-radius: 4px; height: auto; max-width: 98%;\" src=\"https:\/\/daveandjackierun.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/07\/hotsprings1-034.jpg?w=620&amp;h=349\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/daveandjackierun.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/07\/hotsprings1-034.jpg?w=620&amp;h=349 620w, https:\/\/daveandjackierun.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/07\/hotsprings1-034.jpg?w=150&amp;h=85 150w, https:\/\/daveandjackierun.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/07\/hotsprings1-034.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169 300w, https:\/\/daveandjackierun.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/07\/hotsprings1-034.jpg?w=768&amp;h=433 768w, https:\/\/daveandjackierun.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/07\/hotsprings1-034.jpg 800w\" alt=\"Cougar Annies Garden!\" width=\"620\" height=\"349\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1371\" data-attachment-id=\"1371\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/daveandjackierun.wordpress.com\/2013\/07\/30\/an-interesting-run-from-cougar-annies-along-the-hesquiaht-peninsula\/hotsprings1-034\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/daveandjackierun.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/07\/hotsprings1-034.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"800,451\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;4.2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;PENTAX Optio WG-1&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1305231476&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;5&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;80&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.004&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"hotsprings1 034\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;run Cougar Annies garden, Peter Buckland, Hesquiaht, Boat basin, Hot Springs Cove, Refuge Cove, run, walk, hike.&lt;\/p&gt; \" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/daveandjackierun.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/07\/hotsprings1-034.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/daveandjackierun.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/07\/hotsprings1-034.jpg?w=620\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nThe garden has re-opened after seven years to small groups of people.
