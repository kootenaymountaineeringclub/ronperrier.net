It lies between the Monashee Mountains to the west and the Selkirks to the east. The lake level fluctuates 37 feet between low water in April and high water in early July. In 2012, with a massive snowpack and the wettest spring in history, the lake was allowed to go 2 feet above high water. Most beaches disappear, and thus camping recommendations are limited to the few sites above this level. When water levels drop, many gorgeous sandy beaches appear. The water is quite warm in summer, and swimming is good. The lake is divided into Upper and Lower, with the Narrows, just south of Nakusp, separating them.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nHistory.<\/strong> Before the Columbia River Treaty and the Hugh Keenleyside Dam on Lower Arrow Lake at Castlegar, the Upper and Lower Arrow Lakes were separated by a 32km (20-mile) section where the Columbia River narrowed. When the gates of the Hugh Keenleyside Dam were lowered in midsummer 1969, the rising waters spread over the hamlets of Deer Park, Renata, Farquier, Needles, Edgewood and Burton as well as hundreds of summer homes and favourite fishing holes. Buildings had been removed or burned before the reservoir was filled, while residents either moved away or reestablished themselves above the floodwaters.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>UPPER ARROW LAKE<\/strong>.

Halcyon was developed by Captain George Sanderson, who arrived in the early 1880s. He erected a small building around a plunge, to which a wooden pipe brought hot water down the hillside. Adding a stove and bar, he called it Halcyon, signifying health and happiness. The hotel was purchased by the BA Corporation, which was also operating the Rossland mines. In addition, cottages and bottling works were added. It revived after WWI and Prohibition and was bought by the White Cross and managed by General Burnham. The hotel was completely renovated and filled with the general&#8217;s family treasures. Cottages and a series of hot baths drew thousands for over 35 years despite the only access being by the sternwheeler Minto. As the vessel pulled into the dock, it was greeted by the General, two black spaniels, and Old Mule Jack, who hauled luggage up from the wharf. In 1955, while lighting the kitchen stove, Burnham spilled oil, and the hotel, all its treasures, and the General himself were consumed in the fire.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <strong><br \/>\nCamp<\/strong>. 58 km west.

In 1887, 3 French Canadian prospectors built a log hotel. In 1907, the land was acquired by the Western Land Company of Winnipeg and subdivided into orchards. The name was changed from Dog Creek to Renata, and soon 20 homesteads dotted the flat. The first settlers were mostly of German origin &#8211; Mennonites from Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Others followed, and they all banded together to form a cooperative for packing, selling, and shipping fruit. They also built an irrigation system laboriously making pipes by boring holes through logs, and a sawmill to make fruit boxes. During peak years, thousands of pounds of cherries, peaches, pears, and apples were shipped &#8211; all by water, as there was no road after the Minto docked for the last time in 1954, a three-car cable ferry connected with the Deer Park road.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Among the 150 or so residents were half a dozen different religious denominations (Mennonite, Catholic, Salvation Army, Presbyterian, and Lutheran), each holding services in the schoolhouse. Finally, in 1954, the Pentecostals remodelled a house into the Living Waters Chapel.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">When the houses and buildings of Renata were burned before flooding, the citizens placed a plaque in the Robson cemetery in memory of the pioneer residents.<br \/>\n<em>&#8220;This plaque commemorates the community of Renata and its 58 former residents who lie beneath the water of the Arrow Reservoir&#8221;<\/em>.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\nAcross the lake is a boat launch used by the residents of Renata to access their homes.

The construction company picked a site on Lower Arrow Lake, 48 km from Robson, as its headquarters, calling it Brooklyn. Equipment was brought by sternwheeler and barge while camps were established along the lakeshore so that work could proceed in both directions. A suitable pass through the nearby 8,000-foot Rossland Range which separates the Columbia Valley from Christina Lake had been found up Brooklyn Creek to the watershed of Dog and McCrae Creeks and down the latter to Christina Lake where Cascade City was born (with the settlements of Gladstone, Paulson, and Coryell briefly flashing into life only to vanish when construction had passed).<br \/>\nBrooklyn was on a point of land on claims belonging to William Parker. He had grown poor working his mining claims, but now his lots sold for up to $50 and then $200 as speculators, business people, workers, and others flooded in from all over the Northwest. JS Peterson from Trail built the 2-story Crown Point Hotel. The Brooklyn News appeared 5 days after the town was born. A wharf and warehouse were built on the water, bunkhouses for workers, a hospital, and a jail with room for a court and two cells. Life in Brooklyn was hectic.<br \/>\nThrough the summer, the railway curved along sheer cliffs, climbing steadily. When it reached Brooklyn, it was 1,000 feet above the town. Here, it left Lower Arrow Lake to enter Dog Creek. As work progressed, stopping places appeared as shelters, a bar, and a hotel at Paulson, Gladstone, and Coryell.<br \/>\nFor Brooklyn, its life had ended even before the railway was completed. When the construction crews moved westward, they were followed by the saloon keepers and shop owners who stripped the buildings of doors and windows. In Sept 1899, the remains of Brooklyn burned to ashes. Only 2 months later, a visitor &#8220;went to the spot where the town had been and then almost wondered if he had dreamed of there having been such a place&#8221;. Parker&#8217;s claim became a lonely clearing in the forest, and he was as poor as before the railway. In 1910, a development company planted fruit trees, but the project failed. W Schneider bought it in 1922 and farmed until 1958. Today, the farm and site lie below the reservoir.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><br \/>\nDeer Park<\/strong>. This community, which has no services, has many cottages and a few permanent residents. The gravel road access is good. Across the lake is the beautiful rail trail, the start of the Kettle Valley Railway rail trail that starts at Castlegar and ends in Hope, BC. It climbs steadily from Castlegar, has several nice trestles and after turning south, goes through a kilometre-long tunnel.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\"><strong><em><br \/>\nHistory<\/em>.<\/strong> Originally an Indian camping ground, it was born in 1896 when ES Topping and the 3 Petersen brothers of Trail, lured by mineral deposits, purchased 1,800 acres. In 1898, with the construction of the railway across the lake, a boom started. The Bates brothers built the Grand View Hotel, and Mrs. Luxton&#8217;s bakery turned out 1.000 loaves a day for Brooklyn. Sporadic mining, farming, and cutting cordwood for Arrow Lakes stern wheel steamers provided some work. In 1907, a school opened with 10 students. In 1912, a group of Mennonites built a church. But little change occurred, as for over 50 years it was accessible only by water. Finally, a road was built in 1954, but it was only a few years before it flooded, too.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <strong><br \/>\nTulip Creek Falls.<\/strong> 109km north.
