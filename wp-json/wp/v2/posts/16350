It is the newest state, formed in 1988 and encompassing what had formerly been the northern two-fifths of the state of\u00a0Goi\u00e1s.\u00a0Tocantins covers 277,620.91 square kilometres and had an estimated population of 1,496,880 in 2014.\u00a0Construction of its capital,\u00a0Palmas, began in 1989; most of the other cities in the state date to the\u00a0Portuguese colonial\u00a0period. With the exception of\u00a0Aragua\u00edna\u00a0there are few other cities with a significant population in the state. The government has invested in a new capital, a major hydropower dam, railroads, and related infrastructure to develop this primarily agricultural area.<br \/>\nTocantins has attracted hundreds of thousands of new residents, primarily to Palmas. It is building on its hydropower resources. The\u00a0Araguaia\u00a0and\u00a0Tocantins\u00a0rivers drain the largest watershed that lies entirely inside Brazilian territory. The Rio Tocantins has been dammed for hydropower, creating a large reservoir that has become a center of recreation. Because it is in the central zone of the country, Tocantins has characteristics of the\u00a0Amazon Basin, and also semi-open pastures, known as\u00a0cerrado. The\u00a0Bananal Island\u00a0(Ilha do Bananal), in the southwest of the State, is the second-largest\u00a0fluvial\u00a0island in the world.\u00a0Tocantins is also home to the\u00a0Araguaia National Park, the Caraj\u00e1s Indian reservations, and\u00a0Jalap\u00e3o State Park, which is about 250 kilometres (160\u00a0mi) from Palmas. There, the rivers create oases in the dry landscape, attracting many eco-tourists to the region.<br \/>\nTocantins is bordered to the northeast by the states of\u00a0Maranh\u00e3o\u00a0and\u00a0Piau\u00ed,\u00a0Bahia\u00a0to the east,\u00a0Goi\u00e1s\u00a0to the south,\u00a0Mato Grosso\u00a0to the west, and\u00a0Par\u00e1\u00a0to the northwest.<br \/>\n<strong>Climate.<\/strong> Most of Tocantins (except the extreme western and northern regions) is situated within a vast Brazilian area known as the\u00a0cerrado. The cerrado region&#8217;s typical climate is hot and semi-humid, with pronounced seasonal variation marked by a dry winter from May through October. The &#8220;cerrado&#8221; landscape covers 87% of Tocantins and is characterized by extensive savanna formations crossed by gallery forests and stream valleys.\u00a0Cerrado includes various types of vegetation. Humid fields and &#8220;buriti&#8221; palm paths are found where the water table is near the surface. Alpine pastures occur at higher altitudes and mesophytic forests on more fertile soils. In the north of Tocantins the cerrado gives place to a zone of transition for the\u00a0Amazon biome, near\u00a0Tocantins River.<br \/>\nThe &#8220;cerrado&#8221; trees have characteristic twisted trunks covered by a thick bark and leaves that are usually broad and rigid. The plant&#8217;s thick bark and roots serve as adaptations for the periodic fires which sweep the cerrado landscape.<br \/>\n<strong>Demographics:<\/strong> Pardos\u00a0(brown,\u00a0multiracial) (68.9%), 330,000\u00a0White\u00a0people (24.0%), 95,000\u00a0Black\u00a0people (6.9%), 2,000\u00a0Asian\u00a0or\u00a0Amerindian\u00a0people (0.2%).<br \/>\n<strong>Economy.<\/strong> Major agricultural products are soy,\u00a0maize, rice,\u00a0pineapple,\u00a0cattle. Palmas is located on the Bel\u00e9m-Bras\u00edlia highway, vital for economic growth and the flow of production from Tocantins to other states and to ports on the coast.<\/p>\n<p><em>I arrived in Palmas at about 09:30. The drive was through a lot of bush and agricultural land. The bus depot was a little depressing with several families with little kids living in the station in corridors between small shops. <\/em><br \/>\n<em>My next bus to St Luis was for 21:30 (18 hours, 1,400 km), so I had 12 hours to spend here. I read, stored my pack at the bus company, and took a city bus 10 km downtown. After seeing the sites, I went to a mall, ate at a Burger King (easily the best food in Brazil), and spend several hours here using up time.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>PALMAS <\/strong>(pop 307,000) is the capital and largest city located at the state&#8217;s geographic centre at an average altitude of 230\u00a0m. The city is located between the\u00a0Serra do Lajeado\u00a0hills on the east and the\u00a0Tocantins River\u00a0on the west.<br \/>\nPalmas was founded in 1990 and developed\u00a0from the ground up\u00a0in a former agricultural area intended to develop a relatively undeveloped area of the nation to provide better jobs for people. The city has a well-designed road system, and its urban zoning is modeled on that of\u00a0Bras\u00edlia. A symmetrical park lies at the city centre, and a large central avenue similar to\u00a0Bras\u00edlia&#8217;s\u00a0extends north to south.\u00a0The city is home to the\u00a0Federal University of Tocantins.<br \/>\nIn 2002, the\u00a0Lajaedo Hydroelectric Power Plant\u00a0was completed on the Tocantins River, creating a large reservoir and giving the city new beaches. The project also included the construction of a huge bridge: the\u00a0Fernando Henrique Cardoso Bridge, 8 kilometers (5.0\u00a0mi) long, which connects Palmas with the major highway\u00a0BR-153\u00a0and the district of Luzimangues in\u00a0Porto Nacional.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Palmas Airport\u00a0(PMW) connects Palmas with many Brazilian cities.<\/p>\n<p>The center of Palmas is a gigantic park with many things inside &#8211; from North to south:<br \/>\na large cobbled square has 1. a statue of a family with 6 kids and a sheep 2. a sign celebrating the founding of Palmas in 1989, 3. flagpole 4. <strong>Centro Geodesico do Brasil<\/strong> (the geographic center of Brazil) and 5. the Palacio Gregviera.<br \/>\nOn the south of the palace, it is more park-like with an artificial waterfall and rocks, trees, grass, and these two monuments.<br \/>\n<strong>Memorial Coluna Prestes.<\/strong> In the NM Military, War, and Police Museums series, this is the 2001 Oscar Niedermeier building about\u00a0the Coluna Prestes (below). The work in concrete is marked by winding curves, characteristic of Niemeyer&#8217;s works.<br \/>\nThe access ramp to the entrance and the bronze sculpture has a red color representing the blood that was shed for their country. The sickle shape symbolizes communism, which Prestes advocated. Completing the outside of the Memorial is the bronze sculpture &#8220;Knight of Light&#8221;, representing Luiz Carlos Prestes. The Memorial houses a collection of 81 original pieces on display that tell the story of the Coluna Prestes and its members, through photographs, documents, and personal objects. It also houses a pocket theater with a capacity of 87 seats, sound room, dressing room, and bathroom.<br \/>\n<em>Coluna Prestes<\/em> (Prestes Column), was a social rebel movement that broke out in Brazil between 1925 and 1927. The rebellion&#8217;s ideology was diffuse, but the main issues that caused it were the general dissatisfaction with the oligarchic\u00a0First Brazilian Republic, the demand for the institution of the secret ballot, and the defense of better public education. The rebels marched some 25,000 km (15,534 mi) through the Brazilian countryside. They did not aim to defeat the forces of the Federal government in battle, but rather to ensure their survival and their ability to continue threatening the government. The young army officers\u00a0occupied large parts of the city. However, they were soon besieged by increasingly numerous federal troops. After 3 weeks under heavy bombardment, the rebels abandoned their positions. Filling a train with men and supplies, they retreated into the countryside eventually reaching and occupying the city of\u00a0Foz do Igua\u00e7u\u00a0in the state of Paran\u00e1, on the frontier with\u00a0Argentina. There the rebels established a powerful defense line and waited for their enemies.<br \/>\n3 months after the retreat of the\u00a0<i>Tenentes<\/i>\u00a0from S\u00e3o Paulo, numerous army units also rebelled in the many other cities. An energetic response by the state government meant that soon the rebels were in disarray. Only in the region of S\u00e3o Luiz Gonzaga they were able to resist under the leadership of Captain\u00a0Lu\u00eds Carlos Prestes\u00a0of the 1st Frontier Battalion of Santo \u00c2ngelo. Under his orders, the remaining rebel forces were reorganized.<br \/>\nIn December 1924 fourteen thousand men loyal to the government marched towards S\u00e3o Lu\u00edz Gonzaga and started to fortify positions around the rebels. |Between February and March 1927, after crossing the\u00a0Pantanal, part of the column led by Siqueira Campos arrived in\u00a0Paraguay\u00a0while the rest entered\u00a0Bolivia. Upon seeing their precarious conditions, General Dias Lopes&#8217; instructed the revolutionaries to go into exile.<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup><strong>Os 18 do Forte de Copacabana\u00a0<\/strong>occurred on July 5, 1922, in\u00a0Rio de Janeiro, It was the first revolt of the\u00a0<i>tenentista<\/i>\u00a0movement, in the context of the Brazilian\u00a0First Republic. Although the 1922 revolt at Copacabana fort ended in failure, the sheer audacity by which the small band of rebels attacked a much larger force captured the attention of the public and inspired similar movements by the\u00a0<i>tenentes<\/i>\u00a0later on.<span id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\" style=\"line-height: 1; font-size: 10px; height: 0px; position: relative; vertical-align: baseline; bottom: 1ex;\">[2]<\/span>\u00a0Some sources maintained that the uprising was doomed from the start because the authorities, including the Brazilian president, knew of the plot.

The\u00a0<i>tenentes<\/i>\u00a0(lieutenants) called for reforms in the country&#8217;s power structure. Among these reforms was the end of the\u00a0<i>cabresto<\/i>\u00a0vote (a tool of political control through the abuse of authority, the buying of votes, the use of public institutions, violence, ghost voting, exchange of favors, and\u00a0fraud). Other goals included the institution of the secret ballot, and the reform of public education.<br \/>\nIn 1922 until 1930, the\u00a0<i>tenentes<\/i>\u00a0constituted a minority in the officer corps and the movement was based in only one part of society, the army, and this isolated the Tenentista movement from the rest of the society.<br \/>\nThe Fort Copacabana rebels fired their cannons against many important government and military bases during the early morning of the 5th. Throughout the rest of the day, the fort was bombed. In the early morning of the 6th, 273 of 301 left the Fort. A destroyer and two battleships took up positions near the Fort and started to shell it. The government&#8217;s last word to the rebels was an order to either surrender or be destroyed. The Tenentistas still inside the Fort then cut a Brazilian flag in 29 pieces, one for each rebel, and decided to march to the Catete Palace, the head office of the\u00a0Executive Power. Most of the 29 remained, but only 24\u00a0<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\">[4]<\/sup>\u00a0were left (a civilian joined then to form this number). Walking down Avenida Atlantica next to the beach, they met a combined force of loyalist troops and police in the middle of Copacabana. Only Lieutenants Siqueira Campos and Eduardo Gomes along with four other rebels survived. A photograph first published in the daily,\u00a0<i>O Malho<\/i>\u00a0shows eighteen rebels. For that reason, the public still erroneously refers to those who took part in the battle on the insurgent&#8217;s side as &#8220;The Eighteen of the Fort&#8221;.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup><\/p>\n<p>==============================================================<\/p>\n<p><strong>Brazil \u2013 Maranh\u00e3o (Sao Luis) <\/strong>Feb 1-2, 2022<\/p>\n<p><em>I arrived in Sao Luis at 23:00 after a 26-hour bus ride from Palmas and slept in the bus depot<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>MARANHAO <\/strong>(pop 7 million).

The people of Maranh\u00e3o have a distinctive accent inside the common Northeastern Brazilian dialect. Maranh\u00e3o is described in books such as\u00a0The Land of the Palm Trees. The state has 3.4% of the Brazilian population and produces only 1.3% of the Brazilian\u00a0GDP. it is the poorest state in the country of Brazil.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0dunes\u00a0of\u00a0Len\u00e7\u00f3is\u00a0are an important area of environmental preservation.

Much of the forest has been cleared for cattle grazing and agriculture, and the Baba\u00e7u palm produces edible oil which is extracted commercially.<br \/>\nThe southern portion is the\u00a0Brazilian Highlands, occupied by the\u00a0Cerrado\u00a0savannas.<br \/>\nThe rivers of the state all flow northward to the Atlantic and a majority of them have navigable channels.

The largest of these are the Ba\u00eda de Turiassu, facing which is\u00a0S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Island, and the contiguous bays of S\u00e3o Marcos and S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9, between which is the large island of\u00a0S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds. This indented shoreline is home to the\u00a0Maranh\u00e3o mangroves, the tallest mangrove forests in the world.

Harmoniously expanded through the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, the historic centre is an outstanding example of a Portuguese colonial town adapted to the climatic conditions of Equatorial America, with traditional Portuguese architecture adapted to incorporate raised piers and shuttered, wooden verandas. The singularity of the construction techniques employed is expressed in the elegance of the traditional Portuguese\u00a0<em>azulejos<\/em>\u00a0tile work applied both as insulation and decoration; in the modulated use of occupied and empty spaces reinforced by crafted stonework; and in the sharp contrast between the dense ornamentation of the facades overhanging the streets and porches that open wide from side to side into interior patios, lined by a continuous series of venetians, lattices, and frames.<br \/>\nThe Historic Centre is however extremely vulnerable to abandonment and neglect, and measures are being taken to address this issue, despite the urban rehabilitation initiatives to restore the architecture and enhance the area\u2019s landscape value.<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong>The overlay of the various periods in the evolution of the Historic Center of S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, from the inception of the original site in the 16th century, reflected in the French fortifications; through the growth of the Portuguese city in the 17th century; to its splendorous moment in the 18th century as the capital of\u00a0<em>Gr\u00e3o Par\u00e1<\/em>; and its rise as the homogenous aristocratic commercial metropolis of the 19th century, remain in evidence in the historic centre\u2019s structural elements.

The state has 1.6% of the Brazilian population and produces 0.7% of the Brazilian\u00a0GDP.<br \/>\nPiaui has the shortest coastline of any coastal Brazilian state at 66\u00a0km (41\u00a0mi), and the capital,\u00a0Teresina, is the only state capital in the northeast to be located inland. The reason for this is, unlike the rest of the area, Piaui was first colonized inland and slowly expanded towards the ocean, rather than the other way around. In the southeast of the state, the\u00a0National Park\u00a0of\u00a0Serra da Capivara\u00a0is a\u00a0UNESCO\u00a0World Heritage Site. The park has more than 400 archaeological sites of prehistoric\u00a0Paleo-Indian\u00a0and sedentary-based\u00a0Indigenous Brazilian\u00a0complex cultures. and the largest concentration of\u00a0rock paintings\u00a0in the world, in a landscape dominated by\u00a0canyons\u00a0and\u00a0caatinga.<br \/>\n<strong>History.<\/strong> In the 17th century, many impoverished noblemen and\u00a0Jesuit\u00a0priests, as well as black and\u00a0Amerindian\u00a0slaves, settled there. The first large-scale cattle farming also arrived with these settlers. Large estate owners seeking new pastures for their livestock.<br \/>\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the principal industry of the state was stock raising, A secondary industry was the raising of goats, which were able to stand neglect and a scanty food supply. Agricultural products were cotton, sugar, and tobacco. Forest products included rubber,\u00a0carnauba\u00a0wax, and\u00a0dyewoods. Exports included hides, skins, rubber, wax, tobacco, and cotton.<br \/>\nTeresina was the first Brazilian city to be planned. In 1852, situated at the confluence of the\u00a0Parna\u00edba\u00a0and\u00a0Poti Rivers, Teresina was (and still is) known as the Green City because of the countless\u00a0mango\u00a0trees that line the city&#8217;s streets.<br \/>\n<strong>Geography.<\/strong> Piau\u00ed is bounded on the west by\u00a0Maranh\u00e3o, on the east by\u00a0Cear\u00e1,\u00a0and\u00a0Pernambuco\u00a0on the south by\u00a0Bahia. It has a short Atlantic coastline on the north.<br \/>\n<em>Ecoregions.<\/em> The sandy soils along the Atlantic coast are home to the\u00a0Northeastern Brazil restingas, low evergreen forests adapted to nutrient-poor conditions. The lower basin of the Parna\u00edba is home to the\u00a0Maranh\u00e3o Baba\u00e7u forests, which extend westward into Maranh\u00e3o. This ecoregion is dominated by stands of the\u00a0Baba\u00e7u\u00a0palm.<br \/>\nThe eastern portion of the state is dominated by the dry\u00a0Caatingas\u00a0shrublands, which extend across much of northeastern Brazil. The\u00a0Cerrado\u00a0savannas extend across the southwestern portion of the state, in the basins of the upper Parna\u00edba and Gurgu\u00e9ia rivers. Enclaves of\u00a0Atlantic dry forests\u00a0lie in the basin of the Gurgu\u00e9ia, forming a transition between the Cerrado and Caatinga.\u00a0Serra da Capivara National Park\u00a0is located in the Caatinga of the south-central part of the state and protects numerous caves with ancient cave paintings.<br \/>\n<strong>Climate. <\/strong>The climate is hot and humid in the lowlands and along the lower Parna\u00edba, but in the uplands, it is dry with high day-time temperatures and cool nights.<br \/>\n<strong>Demographics. <\/strong>3,164,000 people &#8211; 2,272,000\u00a0Brown\u00a0(Multiracial) people (71.80%), 739,000\u00a0White\u00a0people (23.36%), 145,000\u00a0Black\u00a0people (4.60%), 41,000\u00a0Amerindian\u00a0people (0.47%), 5,000\u00a0Asian\u00a0people (0.17%), 2,000\u00a0Amerindian\u00a0people (0.05%).<br \/>\n<strong>Religion.<\/strong>\u00a0Catholicism\u00a0(85.1%),\u00a0Protestantism\u00a0(9.7%). It is the state with the lowest proportion of\u00a0Protestants, and the highest proportion of Catholics in the country.<br \/>\n<strong>Economy. <\/strong>Piaui is one of the poorest states of Brazil. The\u00a0service sector 60.1%, the\u00a0industrial sector\u00a0at 27.3%. Agriculture represents 12.6% of\u00a0GDP. Piau\u00ed exports include\u00a0essential oils\u00a019.5%, soybeans 17.1%, woven cotton 15.1%, cashews 12.6%, crustaceans 12.4%, and leather 8.3% (2002).<br \/>\nThere is some mining in the state, including South America&#8217;s only opal mines at Pedro Segundo. Diamonds are mined by Gema do Piau\u00ed Minera\u00e7\u00e3o Ltda (Gemapi). The state has significant deposits of nickel and iron ore.<\/p>\n<p><em>I caught the 12 noon bus from the Rodoviaria in Sao Luis for the 453 km, 8-hour drive to Teresina. We passed through almost exclusively heavily deforested pasture land and extensive palm forests. Like all of Brazil, everything is a verdant green as this is the rainy season.<br \/>\nI arrived at the Teresina Rodoviaria at about 8 pm, found out my bus ride to Forteleza the next day and walked across the street to my hotel for the night (Hotel Cidade Express).\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>TERESINA\u00a0<\/strong>(pop 868,075) is the capital and most populous\u00a0municipality\u00a0in the\u00a0Brazilian\u00a0state of\u00a0Piau\u00ed. Being located in north-central Piau\u00ed 366\u00a0km from the coast, it is the only capital in the Brazilian Northeast that is not located on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean. Together with Timon in the nearby state of Maranh\u00e3o, it forms a\u00a0conurbation\u00a0with a population of about 953,172 inhabitants; the entire metropolitan region of Teresina has over 1,135,920 inhabitants. The only natural barrier that separates Teresina from Timon is the\u00a0Parna\u00edba river, one of the largest in the\u00a0Northeast.<br \/>\nIt is among the 50 cities in the world with the highest murder rates, with 315 homicides in 2017.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><br \/>\n<\/sup>Teresina is the hottest city in the country and the city with the third-highest incidence of lightning in the world. Nowadays, Teresina&#8217;s economy is based on international manufacturing industries and trade.<br \/>\nLocated in a transition zone between the northeast and the Amazon (Mid-North), Teresina is surrounded by mata dos cocais, savannas and cerrad\u00f5es where many carna\u00faba, baba\u00e7u, buriti palms, jatob\u00e1s, ip\u00eas, and many other medium-sized trees can be seen. In the region there are also remnants of Teresina Atlantic Forest, which makes the landscape shrub coverage very rich and dense.<\/p>\n<p><em>I arrived at about 8 pm and walked across the street to my hotel, a fairly low-class affair. In the morning, I took an Uber downtown and back to see the following.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<strong>Piaui Museum.<\/strong> Shows the history of Teresina and of Piau\u00ed in general, including antiques, furniture, china, agricultural equipment, military uniforms, pots and on the ground floor an art gallery of local art. 5 BR<br \/>\n<strong>Karnak Palace.\u00a0<\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Karnak Palace is the official seat of the Piau\u00ed State Executive Branch. Formerly Karnak Palace was a farm of the Baron of Castelo Branco, and only in 1926 became the seat of the State Government and Governor&#8217;s Official Residence, in the management of Matias Ol\u00edmpio de Melo. The last governor to reside in the palace was Petr\u00f4nio Portella.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The name Karnak comes from an ancient Egyptian temple, and the palace architecture was inspired by Greek temples. During the Christmas periods, the palace is decorated and illuminated, including the gardens and the Piau\u00ed Symphony Orchestra. It is also where various honors, governor lunches, decisions, and political meetings take place.<br \/>\nLong pants required to visit.

It was naugurated in 1886 after 12 years of construction. To bury their dead, the main churches had the S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 cemetery, but blacks weren&#8217;t welcome and the church was built, with the money, the sweat and enthusiasm of black slaves.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Built of masonry, with a ceramic industrial cane roof, vaulted ceiling, full-arch lintels and an external floor in ceramic tile, the Church of S\u00e3o Benedito is an imposing building, in Tuscan style like an Italian church, with pyramidal towers that rise more than forty meters high, a cruciform plan.
