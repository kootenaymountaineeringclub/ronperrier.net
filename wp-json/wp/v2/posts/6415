The KMC<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> was founded in 1964 and has been the primary focus of climbing and off-trail hiking in the West Kootenay.\u00a0<\/span>This book includes all the places the club has visited over the last 60 years, on a regular (sometimes irregular) basis.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The club published an annual journal, the Kootenay Karabiner, until 2000, and many local trips were described in it. Since 1974, the club has also produced a Newsletter, the only publication of the club since 2000. Over the years, virtually every mountain has been climbed by club members and described in one of these ways. Reporting has been of variable quality, but some members have made significant contributions to writing about our mountains. They <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">are a wealth of information.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The data is scattered and a<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">n index is essential to retrieve all the information. I have maintained an index for many years making this easy.

I include hikes with and without trails, as well as climbs.<br \/>\n<\/span>I have organized the trips by range and road access. This should be easy for locals, but may be difficult for others to understand.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> 2. <strong>It is encyclopedic<\/strong>. I include EVERY trail, hike, and climb, including those that are not particularly popular or may no longer be used.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I have paddled all the lakes and include a section on the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">water trails<\/span> in the WK. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The railways were an integral part of early travel, and most have been converted to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">rail trails<\/span> suitable for walking, running and cycling. They are also described.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n3. <strong>Formatting<\/strong>. <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The trip reports are formatted the same &#8211; Summary, Statistics, Driving instructions, the trail or route description, and what to do in the area. I plan on adding maps based on Google Earth.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">4. <strong>Paucity of words and photos<\/strong>. <span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">My writing is concise with no extra words, only the information necessary for the hike or climb. Photos are lovely but may not add much.<\/span><br \/>\n5. <strong>Trip Reports<\/strong>.<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> I have included articles extracted from the KMC Newsletter and Karabiner and added them to the trail and mountain reports. These trip reports are designated by a superscript capital letter.<\/span><br \/>\n<\/span>6. <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b>Publication. <\/b><\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">After one writes a book, there are three options to publish it. I believe a webBook is the cheapest and most effective way to publish. A significant difficulty is promoting your book<\/span>. <span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Most people make no profit. Everyone wants to write a book, but most shouldn&#8217;t see the light of day.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">a.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em><strong>webBook.<\/strong><\/em> 1. A webBook is entirely free to produce and read. 2. The size and number of photographs are unlimited (websites have no limit on quantity). 3. They can be edited at any time. Change text, add new hikes and climbs, add maps, update roads or routes or do anything you want. 4. Print out the hike or climb and take one page with you.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Few see a webBook as a viable publishing option when it has only advantages.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A significant issue for me is plagiarism. Hiking and Climbing the West Kootenay has used many sources and books for which permission was not obtained. I think the reference should be made when known. I also wrote High-Functioning Aspergers &#8211; The Source of Genius, and I have virtually copied three books. It would never be published, even as an e-book, as it would not meet plagiarism guidelines.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A disadvantage is that one doesn&#8217;t have something to download to keep personally.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">b. <em><strong>Paper books<\/strong><\/em> can require a significant financial investment with no guarantee of a profit, are onerous to publish, promote and distribute, can&#8217;t be edited, are limited in size both by cost and weight, <\/span><\/span>photos are limited by space and cost, and a paper book <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">requires a purchase. They can be a lot to carry on a hike or backpack.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The main advantage is when you die &#8211; someone (maybe a second-hand bookstore) will have your physical book on their shelves. You are immortalized!<\/span><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">c. <strong>eBook.<\/strong> Amazon and many publishing companies offer eBook publication. They are usually priced below US$9.99, and this is shared as a percentage by the publisher depending on several factors.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">They are work-intensive. I use Grammarly Pro to edit the book. Each chapter needs to be deformatted entirely in Word to produce a PDF. Formatted <\/span><\/span>bullets and <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">number lists, wrapping photos, and page numbers are not allowed. Carefully format the header (it is how you form a Table of Contents later) and paragraphs. And then you have to reformat each chapter manually.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A significant issue for me is that they can&#8217;t be edited after the PDFs are submitted for publication. With a hiking and mountaineering book, it should be possible to add new routes and update old routes as conditions and roads change.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Boundaries of the West Kootenay<br \/>\n<\/strong>The West Kootenay extends from Badshots and Trout Lake in the north to Creston and the US\/Canada border in the south. I have also included a significant section on the Columbia Mountains in the US, an area with some excellent hiking opportunities.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">On the north, the Badshots and the north Purcells are best accessed from the West Kootenay.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The west and east borders are more nebulous &#8211; many trips cross the watershed crests of both the Monashee and Purcell Mountains. Many access points from the &#8220;far side&#8221; are included for completeness&#8217; sake. Many mountains in the south have had little interest in mountaineering, but they are regular destinations for KMC trips, and nothing has been collectively written about them before. Grand Forks in Boundary Country is not explicitly located in the West Kootenay, but it is within the member area of the Kootenay Mountaineering Club and is included.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Production<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I have utilized information from notes made on the margins of my maps over the years, as well as Earl Whipple&#8217;s guides, the KMC newsletters, John Carter&#8217;s<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u00a0<\/span><i>&#8220;Hiking the West Kootenay,&#8221; Copeland&#8217;s two books, Janice Strong&#8217;s &#8220;Mountain Footsteps,&#8221;<\/i><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u00a0and other guidebooks from the Okanagan and East Kootenay.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Road information is in constant flux as roads, especially bridges, wash out with spring storms and run-off, logging patterns change, and forestry deactivates roads with little industrial use.

Joker Millsite to Joker Lakes, Joker Millsite to Slocan Chief Cabin. Access to the west side of the park was also previously impossible for many years, as Enterprise Creek Road was blocked; however, it was finally reopened in 2022. The Enterprise Creek trails were not maintained and were probably rarely, if ever, used. Coffee Creek FSR, never used much anyway, is also washed out. All these trails are becoming progressively overgrown. Lemon Creek Trail has perennial problems with one crossing of Lemon Creek, and this trail is no longer maintained or used to access Glory Basin and the Sapphire Lakes. The Nilsik Trail, although it had another access point, was always more of a route than a trail.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Park funding has plummeted, and trail maintenance has suffered to the point that volunteers play a greater role than parks.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">First ascent information is retained, but I have removed all references except those I have used.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">5.<strong> <em>What to do?<\/em><\/strong> When the trail ends, there are often many possibilities of places to go and explore.

The resulting increased use will be more than made up for by you discovering this truly magnificent area. There will always be secret places that some don&#8217;t want to be advertised. As I have endeavoured to make this encyclopedic, I have also attempted to feature posts on all these secret gems.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>HISTORY of MOUNTAIN WRITING in Southern BC<br \/>\n<\/strong>The oldest publications are by the famous explorer Walter Moberly, one of whose men was the original discoverer of Rogers Pass, before Rogers. A copy of his book is in the Archives of the Whyte Museum of the Canadian Rockies in Banff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Two famous and indispensable books for the guidebook author and the historian of these mountains are those by Arthur O. Wheeler (1905) and Howard Palmer (1914). Both are now collectors\u2019 items, found in mountaineering libraries. The atmosphere of the early exploration of the Columbia Mountains (then known as the Interior Ranges) is well conveyed; the two authors were active mountaineers, and Wheeler was also a skilled mapmaker. An outstanding group of companions in the early history of these mountains was Holway, Butters, and Palmer. Today, their climbs are nothing unusual, but in their day, their ascents were done in such isolation that they were bold indeed, and an accident could mean a serious threat. The biography of Holway is given by his friend, Howard Palmer (1931). \u201cThe Guiding Spirit\u201d is essentially a biography of the well-known mountain guide Edward Feuz, Jr. and is quite entertaining. Little reference is made to the West Kootenay area in this guidebook.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">J. Monroe Thorington was the first of the modern guidebook authors (preceded by Wheeler and Parker, 1912) and produced 1937, 1947, and 1955 editions of the \u201cClimber\u2019s Guide to the Interior Ranges of British Columbia\u201d. His book on the Purcells (1946) recounts his adventures there and is another collector\u2019s item. Thorington sometimes climbed with the superbly competent guide Conrad Kain, whose autobiography is titled \u201cWhere the Clouds Can Go\u201d. Roland Neave\u2019s book about Wells Gray Park is not a traditional mountain guidebook, but it does include a few descriptions of mountain routes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The internet also provides information on access, including the Canadian Mountain Encyclopedia and www.bivouac.com.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">But most of these books did not include much about the area the Kootenay Mountaineering Club frequents most &#8211; the southern portion of all the ranges. Most of the early mountaineering happened around Rogers Pass. Most mountains in the West Kootenay were probably climbed by the early 1900s, primarily by miners, and these individuals were not well known for writing guidebooks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>MODERN SOURCES<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/span><strong>Hiking Guides<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Several books have been written specifically about hiking in the West Kootenay. I believe the first was \u201cExploring the Southern Selkirks\u201d by John Carter and Douglas Leighton.<\/span> <span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Published in 1980, it had many of the trail hikes that we do today in the Selkirks, but excluded the Monashees and Purcells.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In 1993, John Carter published \u201cHiking the West Kootenay\u201d. Two sections on the Purcells and many smaller trails were added for 84 described hikes. But, just as a second edition was to come to press, in February 1996, John Carter died in an avalanche. The book was never published, and a new trail guide was needed as many new trails had been built.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">That void was filled by the Copelands, an American couple who make their living by writing hiking guidebooks. In Canada, they wrote their controversial \u201cDon\u2019t Waste Your Time\u201d books on the Canadian Rockies, Cascades, and BC Coast Mountains. They then moved to Riondel and wrote \u201cDon\u2019t Waste Your Time in the West Kootenay,\u201d published in 2000. It gives reliable road access information and trail descriptions and is well-liked by many locals. Hikes were rated from one to four boots, reflecting their opinionated views.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">To quote them: \u201cAsking locals for trail information led us to mountaineers who bushwhack like baboons and climb like lizards and whose advice emphasizes vertical, trail-less terrain. What\u2019s a hiker to do? Our precise, comprehensive directions will guide you to a transcendent mountain experience!\u201d<br \/>\nThey were referring to the members of the Kootenay Mountaineering Club who showed them many of the routes, of which I am a proud member. Of course, we use all the same trails described in their guidebooks.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Sixty-eight hikes were covered, including several in northern Washington and Idaho. Many were minor, including 16 on lakes that nobody goes to.\u00a0<\/span><\/span>I find them very wordy. Going past the end of the trail is only for experienced mountaineers, and no information is given. Virtually every KMC trip climbs a mountain. <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">They renamed things &#8211; the &#8220;Old Growth Trail&#8221;<\/span> <span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">was changed to &#8220;Cedar Grove&#8221;. Some hikes were duplicated &#8211; Kokanee Glacier is both a day hike and a backpacking trip<\/span><\/span>\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">(admittedly to Lemon Pass). In 2005, they followed up with \u201cWhere the Locals Hike in the West Kootenay\u201d. Now with colour pictures but only 50 hikes, this was another economic venture for the Copelands. These two books were the only ones available for purchase in 2015. Amazingly, they are still the go-to information sources for many. This is despite having up-to-date, free, and accurate hiking guides, such as Abby Wilson&#8217;s &#8220;West Kootenay Hiking&#8221;.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The Purcells were first written about in 1978, in \u201c<em>Exploring the Purcell Wilderness<\/em>\u201d by Anne Edwards, Patrick Morrow, and Arthur Twomey. Janice Strong continued with \u201c<em>Mountain Footsteps \u2013 Hikes in the East Kootenay of Southeastern British Columbia<\/em>\u201d. My last copy is its third edition from 2011, and it has probably been updated since then.
