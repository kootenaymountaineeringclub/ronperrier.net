He sits in a worn armchair in his comfortable Nelson, British Columbia, bungalow wearing a sweater, shorts, and wool socks. The gash on his right leg is hard to miss, all red, inflamed, and long. \u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing,\u201d he says when I ask him about it. \u201cI was crossing a creek when I snagged my shin. Looks worse than it is.\u201d This wouldn\u2019t be that remarkable\u2014the scrape is the kind most schoolyard kids brandish\u2014except Dean is 90 years old.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"attachment-single-wide size-single-wide wp-post-image\" src=\"https:\/\/mountainculturegroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/active-elderly-feature-1200x960.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mountainculturegroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/active-elderly-feature-1200x960.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/mountainculturegroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/active-elderly-feature-300x240.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mountainculturegroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/active-elderly-feature-600x480.jpg 600w, https:\/\/mountainculturegroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/active-elderly-feature-200x160.jpg 200w, https:\/\/mountainculturegroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/active-elderly-feature-340x272.jpg 340w, https:\/\/mountainculturegroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/active-elderly-feature-768x614.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mountainculturegroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/active-elderly-feature-720x576.jpg 720w, https:\/\/mountainculturegroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/active-elderly-feature.jpg 1600w\" alt=\"\" \/><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Bob Dean in his Nelson home. He was 90 years old when this photo was taken. Photo Kari Medig\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br \/>\nThe steep 1.8-kilometre trail that he most frequents leads to a Nelson overlook called Pulpit Rock. He hikes it most days in about 30 minutes, even in winter. He\u2019s a slight man with pointy ears and a white beard, and because of his inexhaustible energy, most guess his age to be 70. It\u2019s a number that makes him chuckle. \u201cI didn\u2019t bother hiking Pulpit until my seventies,\u201d he exclaims. \u201cBefore then I was doing real hikes in the mountains.\u201d When asked about the secret of his vitality, he pauses, looks around his sparse living room with its couch, chair, and upright piano, and replies, \u201cNo television.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Some might credit Dean\u2019s longevity and vitality to genetics, but science has proven there\u2019s more to it. In fact, there are seven distinct areas on Earth where centenarians\u2014people who are at least 100 years old\u2014thrive. Each location shares remarkable similarities with the Kootenays. Yet, surprisingly, this region has the lowest life expectancy in British Columbia (excluding the province\u2019s north), which begs the question, if we have access to a fountain of youth, why aren\u2019t we tapping it?<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">According to the Provincial Health Services Authority, British Columbia residents enjoy the highest life expectancy in the country, with an average of 82.3 years, six months longer than the Canadian average. But both East and West Kootenay residents can expect to live to 80.9, almost a year and a half less. To discover why this is and how we might counteract it, we researched centenarian populations around the world, as well as local seniors who have bucked the trend and who are still going strong.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Longevity has always fascinated scholars, but its global study is a recent phenomenon. In the early 1970s, Dr. David Davies travelled to the mountainous Vilcabamba Valley of Ecuador where he discovered and then wrote, \u201cA lifespan of 100 years is regarded as unexceptional.\u201d He noted the plethora of 80- to 100-year-olds there when, at the time, the life expectancy in the rest of Ecuador was 59, and he was amazed by the fact that they were all active. Most were still hiking the steep slopes of the region, harvesting fruit, and tilling soil.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Other geographic regions boasting active centenarians who are now under study include the Caucasus Mountains in southern Russia; the Hunza River Valley in north Pakistan; Okinawa, Japan; Sardinia, Italy; Nicoya, Costa Rica; and Icaria, Greece. Many of these regions came to be called \u201cBlue Zones\u201d because Belgian demographer Michel Poulain liked to mark them on maps with blue circles. The one major thing they all have in common? Mountains.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cMountainous regions offer cleaner water, cleaner air, and the terrain requires us to constantly move up and down,\u201d says 78-year-old Kaslo, British Columbia, resident Dr. Laurence Moss. \u201cPlus, it\u2019s a dynamic environment. The weather\u2019s always changing, for example, which means we inhabitants are better at coping. We\u2019re more resilient and less anxious when change happens.\u201d Laurence has a Ph.D. in urban and regional planning and has lived in cities such as New York and Indonesia\u2019s capital, Jakarta, as well as mountain towns in Europe, North America, and Southeast Asia. An avid fly fisherman, he settled in Kaslo, about 70 kilometres north of Nelson, a decade ago for the great fishing and culture, making a point of getting outside every day, which is another commonality all Blue Zone residents have. It\u2019s also a distinct commonality of each person interviewed for this story. Diets varied as did personality types. Some watched TV, some shunned it. Some had parents that lived to an old age and others didn\u2019t. What they did all share, though, was the desire, the need, to get outdoors.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In his book,\u00a0<em>The Blue Zones Solution: The Revolutionary Plan to Eat and Live Your Way to Lifelong Health<\/em>, researcher and author Dan Buettner describes the similarities of various centenarian populations and, notably, genetics is only listed as a key influence in Sardinia. More importantly, he says, residents who live in mountainous environments, have a sense of community and individual purpose, take time to rest and relax, and all spend large portions of their days outside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Castlegar resident <strong>Wilma Turner<\/strong> says the first thing she does every morning is get out for a two-mile walk in her hilly neighbourhood. The 86-year-old credits her vigour in part to those she surrounds herself with, including her kids, grandkids, friends, and her husband, George, who, at 87, still gets a hunting license every year. \u201cIf he lives with me he has to be active!\u201d she says emphatically. As for her advice on longevity, she recommends, \u201cGet busy! If you don\u2019t use it, you lose it. Do what you love\u2026or try something new. But don\u2019t try drugs. They\u2019re not going to help you much.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Rino Dibiasio<\/strong> certainly gets busy. The 82-year-old Trail native has been ski patrolling at Rossland\u2019s Red Mountain Resort for the past 62 years, and he\u2019s currently with the volunteer ski patrol. When he\u2019s not at the hill, he spends his days cross-country skiing before hitting the gym in the evenings for good measure. During the summer, he bikes and trains for various senior games around North America. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to spend all your time around the TV,\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t be a couch potato. Have an active lifestyle and just keep going.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>George Coletti<\/strong> concurs. He\u2019s lived in Nelson most of his life and says he\u2019s climbed just about every mountain in the area and fished every lake. These days he limits his fishing to the west arm of Kootenay Lake, but he tends his garden daily and gets a hunting license every year. Not bad for a 95-year-old. \u201cWe\u2019re fortunate because we live where we can stay active. That\u2019s a big part of it,\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t give up the things you love doing.\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">If we&#8217;re so fortunate, why aren\u2019t there more approaching centenarians clogging up our single track? Many of our seniors fall into the category of \u201clost generation,\u201d a term used in\u00a0<em>Psychology Today<\/em>\u00a0that refers to a generation considered to have lost societal value, importance and the ability to contribute. So how can we all enjoy a longer, more active life?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cPut your iPhone in the garbage can,\u201d answers Castlegar resident, <strong>Bert Port<\/strong>, a significant contributor to the mountain lore of the Kootenays. Port was a member of the first party to ski the Spearhead Traverse, near Whistler, British Columbia, in 1964. He did it a second time in 2014\u2014at the age of 82. He had to purchase new ski equipment for his latest trip, prompting his wife Sue to regularly tell this joke: \u201cWhat\u2019s the definition of an optimist? An 82-year-old who buys all-new touring gear.\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\nLike the Ports, <strong>Ken Holmes<\/strong> is an active member of the Kootenay Mountaineering Club. He regularly skis and hikes the trails in his hometown of Rossland, and last year he went on a rock-climbing trip to Kalymnos, Greece. When he hears Sue\u2019s optimist joke, he laughs and then retorts, \u201cActually, the real definition is a 78-year-old guy who gets his rock shoes resoled.\u201d<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">If we all stay active in the outdoors, get involved in the community, relax often and enjoy fresh mountain air and water, we should be able to hike until we\u2019re 100, right? Not quite. For one, we\u2019re not as isolated as other Blue Zones, which means we experience more of an influx of processed foods, contagions, and, ultimately, people. As Canada\u2019s population ages and people look to escape crowded urban centres for more remote areas, we could see a rise in our elderly population. And that might be a good thing if the newcomers prescribe to the tenets of mountain culture. However, more people can also mean more development, and, as Dr. Laurence Moss warns, \u201cWe need to actively resist our mountain towns turning into the next Aspen.\u201d<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Dr. Moss also says that recreating here simply isn\u2019t enough to ensure a long, vital life. \u201cIf you\u2019re using recreating appropriately, that is you are \u201cre-creating,\u201d then yes, you could live longer and better,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you\u2019re just zipping through the mountains, chasing that thrill, don\u2019t expect to get the deep benefits that come from being immersed in a mountainous environment. Your attachment to it is too superficial. That\u2019s kind of a hard statement, I know, but it\u2019s true. When I was younger, I was a competitive downhill skier and that is a very different experience from fishing a mountain stream, where I\u2019m truly immersed in the arteries of the Earth.\u201d<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Every person interviewed for this story spoke of the outdoors with reverence. They were not stoked on the sick line they had just slayed or their king-of-the-mountain Strava time. They simply recognized a regular need to get outside and interact with the environment. Bert Port says he often goes into the Drinnon Lake area for a few nights by himself. \u201cIt\u2019s an experience,\u201d he says. \u201cIt forces you to be more aware. Not just because of accidents, but because you feel more connected to everything.\u201d Ninety-five-year-old George Coletti has also been known to go on solo excursions on the lake. \u201cOne day, I was out there in my rowboat, and it was so beautiful I just stopped, took it all in, and thought, \u2018Lord, if there isn\u2019t a heaven then please just leave me here.\u2019\u201d<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Whether you\u2019re into hiking, paddling, skiing, biking or any of the many outdoor activities available in the Kootenays, Dr. Moss says, \u201cThey are all thrilling pursuits in their own way. But if you want the cherry on the sundae\u2026the long healthy life\u2026then it\u2019s a total experience. It\u2019s about being a part of it. You come to realize that through recreation, even if it\u2019s just going for a walk outside, you are connected. It\u2019s knowing that you\u2019re a part of something greater. And that\u2019s as close as you get to nirvana.\u201d In other words, if you want the fountain of youth, there\u2019s every good chance you\u2019ll find it in the Kootenays. But first, you must learn to sip slowly. It\u2019s going to be a long ride.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_14975\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>HOW TO LIVE TO 100: ADVICE FROM KOOTENAY SENIORS by Vince Hempsall, editor Kootenay Mountain Culture Magazine. 2018 https:\/\/mountainculturegroup.com\/how-to-live-to-100-according-to-kootenay-seniors\/.
