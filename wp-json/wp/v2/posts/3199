Nine days later, Indonesian Forces invaded and occupied the country with the tacit approval of the US and Australia<br \/>\nand by July 1976 it was annexed as the province of Timor Timur.<br \/>\nOver the next two decades, Indonesia integrated the colony, with many.<br \/>\nsignificant positions of authority being occupied by Indonesians rather than the East Timorese. An estimated 100,000 to 250,000 individuals are believed to have lost their lives during a campaign of pacification during this time.<br \/>\nThe United Nations supervised a popular referendum on 30 August 1999, in which the people of East Timor voted for independence from Indonesia. After the results were announced, gangs of independence opponents, supported by the Indonesian military, terrorised the population in a civil war that destroyed much of the country&#8217;s infrastructure. A United Nations peacekeeping force led by Australian forces was sent in to re-establish a civil society and reconstruct the nation.<br \/>\nOn 20 May 2002, East Timor was internationally recognized as an independent state under the official name of the Democratic Republic of Timor Leste. UN peacekeeping forces remained and a large number of Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) began operating.<br \/>\nIn 2012, UN troops were officially withdrawn and east Timorese police and army took over any military installations. Although there are still NGOs working within the country, their numbers have been steadily declining over 2012.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CLIMATE<\/strong><br \/>\nEast Timor has a hot and humid climate (tropical) with the temperatures averaging 30\u00baC year round, November to May is the wet season when road damage can make travel difficult. The dry season lasts for about 6 months during June to October.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GET IN<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Visa.<\/strong> Generally visitors from any country can easily obtain a 30 day tourist and business visa on arrival to East Timor at Dili Airport or Dili Seaport by filling in a simple form and paying US$30 in cash. Note however that &#8220;visa on arrival&#8221; is not available at the land border, where most travellers apart from Indonesian and Portuguese nationals must have obtained a visa or &#8220;visa application authorisation&#8221; in advance.<br \/>\nTourist Visa requirements as stated by the Immigration Department of East Timor are as follows:<br \/>\nThe applicant must:<br \/>\n\u2022\tDemonstrate intention of a genuine visit (as tourist or business trip).<br \/>\n\u2022\tDemonstrate sufficient funds for period of proposed stay (access to US$100 on entry &#038; US$50 for each day).<br \/>\n\u2022\tDemonstrate accommodation arrangements.<br \/>\n\u2022\tHold a return ticket, or show ability to fund own departure.<br \/>\nThere are no ATM or credit card facilities inside the airport or at border posts, hence visitors must have US$30 in cash to pay for their visa. There is now an ANZ ATM outside the Dili Airport and many ATMs throughout Dili where foreigners can draw money through Visa, Mastercard etc.<br \/>\n<strong>By plane<\/strong><br \/>\nPresidente Nicolau Lobato International Airport&#8217; (IATA: DIL ICAO: WPDL), formerly known as Comoro Airport, is the main international airport of Dili.<br \/>\nMajor international airlines that serve Dili directly include:<br \/>\n\u2022\tAirnorth from Darwin, Australia &#8211; 6 flights per week. Flight Time &#8211; approx 1 hour<br \/>\n\u2022\tAir Timor from Singapore. Chartered &#8216;Silkair: Singapore&#8217; flights. Three times a week full service chartered &#8216;SilkAir&#8217; flights every Tue, Thur and Sat as follows:<br \/>\n\u2022\tMerpati Nusantara Airlines from Bali (Denpasar), Indonesia. Daily return flights from Bali.<br \/>\n\u2022\tSriwijaya Air from Bali (Denpasar), Indonesia. Daily return flights from Bali.<br \/>\nFlying out of Dili, you are subject to the airport departure tax of US$10- which must be paid in cash at the airport counter beside passport control.<br \/>\n<strong>By land<\/strong><br \/>\nThe main land border crossing with Indonesia is at Mota&#8217;ain (or Motain), 115km west of Dili. The nearest East Timorese town is Batugade, 3km to 4km away. The nearest Indonesian town of consequence is the West Timorese town of Atambua. There are also land border crossings at Salele (near Suai) on the south coast, and into Oecussi at Bobometo (north of Kefamenanu on the Indonesian side) and Wini on the north-east coast of Oecussi.<br \/>\nAs mentioned above, visa on arrival is not available at the land border There is an East Timorese Consulate in both Bali and Kupang where you should be able to purchase visas. The same problem exists in the other direction &#8212; even though people of many nationalities can get Indonesian visas-on-arrival when flying into Bali or other Indonesian airports, they cannot get them when traveling from East Timor to West Timor by land, and are required to have visas in advance.<br \/>\nGetting a visa at the Indonesian Embassy in Dili is possible; it takes one week to issue a 60 day tourist visa (return flight not needed!) and it costs US$35.<br \/>\n<strong>By bus<\/strong><br \/>\nCross-border buses There is a direct bus service daily between Dili and Kupang in West Timor, Indonesia. Journey takes 12 hours. There are also many land travel minibus services.<br \/>\n<strong>By boat<\/strong><br \/>\nThere are no regular international passenger ferries servicing East Timor.<br \/>\nThere are regular barge services from Darwin &#8211; Australia, Surabaya and Bali for vehicles and goods.<br \/>\nRecreational vessels often stop into Dili harbour.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GET AROUND<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>By bus<\/strong><br \/>\nBuses, mostly of the small variety found on remote Indonesian islands, run to most parts of the country and main cities like Dili, Baucau, Maliana, Los Palos and Suai are quite well linked. Indonesian-style bemos (vans) and mikrolets (minibuses) &#8211; legacies from its 24-year rule &#8211; run from these cities to nearby villages.<br \/>\nIn Dili, use a mikrolet for 25c to get around. The mikrolets are numbered, and each number goes on a set route. To get off, simply tap your coin on the metal handrail and the driver will stop for you. You pay the driver when you get off.<br \/>\n<strong>By car<\/strong><br \/>\nTaxis are one of the best means of transport in and around Dili. Fares are not very steep ($1-3) and there are lots of them! However, you do need to negotiate the price with the driver first before hopping on. There are few taxis in the evening so do expect an extra $1-$3 more on your trip, especially if it&#8217;s really late and your destination is far.<br \/>\nYou can hire a vehicle (Saloon or 4WD) in Dili for around $85-$120 a day from Rentlo. However, do be prepared for adventure &#8211; besides the tricky roads there is the lack of road signs to contend with. It is possible that you will get so caught up with driving that you miss out the great scenery around you.<br \/>\nWhile in Dili you will need to confine yourself to a speed limit of 40 kph. On open roads you may rev up and touch 50-60 kph. Tourists from the west might find the going slow but that is the maximum speed that can be achieved on Dili roads.<br \/>\nEnsure that you are carrying a valid driving license or permit with you. Do drive carefully and remember that there is no provision here for third-party motor insurance.<br \/>\n<strong>By boat<\/strong><br \/>\nThe Oekusi (Oecussi) Enclave, Ata\u00faru (Ata\u00faro) Island and Dili are well connected by ferry. A boat ride to Jaku (Jaco) Island will prove to be a memorable experience. An added attraction here is that the fishermen also cook fish for you on request!<br \/>\n<strong>By plane<\/strong><br \/>\nAlthough there are airports in Baucau, Suai and Oecussi, there is not a regular domestic air service yet within East Timor. There are small MAF planes that can be chartered to fly to these destinations, which are normally utilized for medical evacuations.<br \/>\n<strong>By motorcycle<\/strong><br \/>\nTiger Fuel in Dili, rents motorcycles for $25-35 per day. Motorcycles\/scooters are a great way to see the country: you&#8217;ll be afforded the freedom of traveling wherever you want at any time, and will have a rather small responsibility in terms of a bike to park over night. Bungee cords may be purchased from Star Moto in Baucau to fasten your luggage to the bike.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TALK<\/strong><br \/>\nTetum and Portuguese are the official languages, but Indonesian is widely spoken, and English is very limited. There are also about 37 indigenous languages, of which Tetum, Galole, Mambae, and Kemak are spoken by significant numbers of people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SEE<\/strong><br \/>\nTourists in East Timor are a rare breed. Simply traveling from village to village, you&#8217;re likely to hear choruses of &#8220;malae&#8221; (the East Timorese word for foreigner) and folks will want to engage you in conversation. One could spend several days just enjoying the feeling of being a very welcome stranger.<br \/>\n<em>Carnival de Timor<\/em> is the annual festival held in Dili in middle of April (sometimes in May, depending on rain season). It is all about fun, music and multiculturalism.<br \/>\nEast Timor is located at the end of the Indonesian archipelago, north of Darwin, Australia and at the base of the Coral Triangle, which hosts the highest diversity of coral and reef fish species on earth.<br \/>\nThe <em>Nino Konis National Park<\/em> (situated in the eastern part of the country) is a well protected area and considered as some of the last surviving zones of tropical lowland rainforest in the world with rich coastal environment. The national park accommodates bird-watching, diving, trekking and pre-historic archeological sites.<br \/>\n<em>Atauro Island and Jaco Island<\/em> in Tutuala attract divers, snorkelers. Both destinations provide eco-lodge facilities with some support from local NGOs in the region. A must-see attraction is the local divers and fishermen in Atauro, who fish using only traditionally made goggles and spear guns. For more adventurous tourists, East Timor offers what is simply world class trekking, which can be experienced near places such as Mount Ramelau (\u00b1 3000 above sea level), Ainaro, Mt. Matebian (Baucau) and Mt. Kablaki.<br \/>\n<em>Birds<\/em> &#8211; 260 species of birds on offer (the entire continent of Australia has some 650 resident species), 32 of which are endemic and 8 of which are exclusive to the island of Timor and found nowhere else in the world.<br \/>\nPortuguese fortresses, churches and other monuments are scattered throughout the nation. For history enthusiasts, East Timor&#8217;s resistance tourism which worth exploring are the Xanana Gusmao\u2019s (current Prime Minister of East Timor) hiding place, Balibo (known for the killing of 5 journalists by the Indonesian soldiers), Santa Cruz (known for a massacre in 1991), Japanese caves in Baucau and many more.<br \/>\n<em>Coffee<\/em> had been the main export commodity for East Timor since the colonial period. To visit East Timor is to taste its coffee grown in several regions such as Ermera, Maubisse, Manufahi and Liquisa. Travel to the coffee plantations takes you through winding mountainous roads, until over 1,000m above sea level altitude, cool climate (as low as 15C).<br \/>\nEast Timor also produces various types of weaved <em>textiles<\/em> &#8211; expensive tais (East Timorese traditional hand-weaved textile) are made from nature-produced colors, while more economical textiles use chemical dye. <\/p>\n<p><strong>DO<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Scuba diving<\/strong><br \/>\nEast Timor has some of the best scuba diving in the world, and this is a major draw for tourists with East Timor shore diving becoming known worldwide amongst the diving community.<br \/>\nDili offers the diver some great close dives. Only 5 min from the center of town is Pertamina Pier. One of East Timors best dives for critters, octopus and schooling Barracudas.<br \/>\nDili Rock 10 min west of Dili. Dili East also offers great opportunities to see Leaf Scorpion fish, Angler fish and Ghost pipe fish.<br \/>\nBubble beach (known for its amazing bubble fields and spectacular deep dive) further West towards Liquica.<br \/>\nEast of Dili divers can experience shore diving at its best. Easy access along the coast allows divers safe entry to great wall dives. Secret garden, K41, Bob&#8217;s Rock and Lone Tree are some of the amazing dives that can be done within an hour of Dili.<br \/>\nThe variety of dives along this stretch of road is endless yet K41 and shark point are among the favourites of the local divers.<br \/>\nAtauro Island is East Timor&#8217;s most pristine diving area. Around the island is a large variaty of dives suitable for every level! Visibility is always excellent, and the abundancy of fish life and coral is simply overwhelming. Our dive masters will be more than happy to show you the hidden secrets of Atauro&#8217;s underwater world.<br \/>\nApproximately 40 min East of Dili the diving starts and continues as far as Com some 200km away.<br \/>\nThere are two major diving companies in Dili Freeflow Diving and Dive Timor-Lorosa.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BUY<\/strong><br \/>\nBanks and a few ATMs can be found in Dili.<br \/>\n<em>Coffee<\/em>. East Timorese coffee is grown organically and tastes fabulous. Coffee was introduced in East Timor by the Portuguese. The local way of making coffee is to roast the coffee beans till they turn black and let out a great aroma. Low acidity levels ensure the excellent taste of East Timorese coffee. A few of the coffee varieties like robusta have very high levels of caffeine. Be sure to buy your coffee in a traditional market.<br \/>\n<em>Tais<\/em>. Colourful hand-woven cloth, come in different designs and colours, depending on the region and distinct family. Silver jewellery, ethnic woodcarvings, batik cloth and embroidered fabrics sporting regional patterns are other handicrafts.<br \/>\n<em>Markets<\/em>. A market can be found in every main town on the island. These markets, however, cater amply to local needs. Tourists attract a lot of attention so be prepared to be stared at. Also expect to be overcharged.<br \/>\n<em>Dili Waterfront<\/em>. Fruit stalls with papayas, mangoes and bananas.<\/p>\n<p><strong>EAT<\/strong><br \/>\nThe East Timorese, like the Indonesians, have a staple diet of rice and the generous use of spices with added international cuisines &#8211; Portuguese, Indonesian, Chinese, Italian, Western, Japanese and Thai.<br \/>\nCommonly grown food crops include taro, cassava, sweet potatoes and maize, then Beans, cabbage, cowpeas, onions, tomatoes and spinach. People also rear poultry, goats and pigs. Fish forms an important part of the diet. Mangoes, watermelons, papayas, bananas and coconuts are the most commonly cultivated fruits here. Carbohydrates like sago or other grains are part of every East Timorese meal.<br \/>\n<em>Tipping<\/em>. Bills in East Timorese restaurants do not have a service charge added to them and tipping is not mandatory. <\/p>\n<p><strong>DRINK<\/strong><br \/>\nNumerous beachfront bars and nightclubs provide the nightlife in Dili. Both food and drinks are served and the bars\/nightclubs are kept open till late. Some very nice inner city restaurants include Nautilaus, Diya, Ocean View Hotel and Gion Japanese Restaurant. In the Meti Aut area is the newly renovated Atlantic Bar and Grill with the best service and quality in Timor. Another is the Caz Bar with barbeque. Kayaks can be hired late in the night.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SLEEP<\/strong><br \/>\nDili has a wide range of hotels, guesthouses, convents any camping at every price level.<br \/>\nNovo Tourismo Resort &#038; Spa (Hotel in Dili), Avenue Bidau Lecidere +670 3310005 (reservation@novoturismotimor.com) stunning new Resort and Spa. From US$160. <\/p>\n<p><strong>STAY SAFE<\/strong><br \/>\nEast Timor continues to face sporadic internal ethnic &#038; political tension and related violence may occur. This may not be targeted at foreigners or tourists. You are travelling in a very poor country, and crimes such as assault and theft do occur: There is still a considerable international presence in East Timor, including a United Nations mission and international police and military (mostly conducting capacity building and training for national security forces).<\/p>\n<p><strong>STAY HEALTHY<\/strong><br \/>\nHospitals and Doctors<br \/>\nThere are hospitals in main centers, and clinics in many sub-districts elsewhere but medical care is not up to dealing with sustained or complex medical emergencies. Medical evacuation is often the only option in the case of complex surgery, trauma, or major illness. Travellers are strongly advised not to enter East Timor without some form of medical insurance. <\/p>\n<p><strong>RESPECT<\/strong><br \/>\nEast Timor was devastated by the Indonesian occupation that may have killed up to 200,000 East Timorese (or 1\/5th of the population). Many East Timorese were forced to abandon their traditional animist beliefs for Roman Catholicism to integrate as part of Indonesia, as Indonesia does not recognize traditional beliefs. Remember this sad fact when dealing with the East Timorese as the occupation will probably not be a distant memory for those who hold it. Many East Timorese are sympathetic or even outright nostalgic about the period of Portuguese rule over East Timor, where they were generally left to their own devices by the Portuguese colonial government<\/p>\n<p><strong>WORK<\/strong><br \/>\nThere may be possibility of work related to agriculture. A good starting point may be to find and contact NGOs working in the country.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CONTACT<\/strong><br \/>\n<em>By phone<\/em><br \/>\nTimor Telecom had a monopoly on landline and mobile phone services in East Timor; expect to pay up to US$3\/minute for international calls into East Timor. Calls out of the country are far cheaper with on average 40cents\/minute to Australia, Indonesia, Portugal and USA. However, competition has now arrived through Indonesian competitors Telkomcel and Telemor.<br \/>\nIt is recommended that you buy a local prepaid sim card for US$3 on arrival from any Timor-Telecom store.<br \/>\nEmergency Contact Numbers<br \/>\nEmergency (Police Emergency): \u260e 112 or 7723 0635 SOS Emergency Medivac: \u260e +61 2 93722468 Dili National Hospital: \u260e 3311008 Bombeiros Fire Rescue: \u260e 3312210 ext 203 \/ 3324019 Timor Ambulance:\u260e 7723 6662, 3311044 Dili National Ambulance, Emergency: \u260e 3310541<br \/>\n<em>By internet<\/em><br \/>\nInternet in East Timor is changing rapidly. Previously, Timor Telecom held a monopoly here, and tried to block voice-over-IP services like Skype. However, the 2013 arrival of Telkomcel and Telemor have provided much improved speeds via USB dongle (sufficient for video Skype). Cost is around $15 per gigabyte.<br \/>\nInternet cafes are available throughout Dili, Baucau, and some other smaller cities: look for Timor Telecom outlets.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>EAST TIMOR (The Democratic Republic of Timor) Capital : Dili Currency: US dollar but uses East Timor centavo coins Area: 15,007 sq km Language: Tetum (official), Portuguese (official, Indonesian, English, 37 indigenous languages Religion: Roman Catholic 90%, Muslim 4%, Portestant &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2015\/01\/13\/timor-leste\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-3199","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-uncategorized"],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p2Ncip-PB","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3199","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3199"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3199\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3199"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3199"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3199"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
