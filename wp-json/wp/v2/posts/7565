It was a yearly ritual to do the climb on July 1, Canada Day, with all our friends &#8211; Mark, Doug, Eric, Lois and whoever we could drag along. This was never an up-and-down trip &#8211; we always boot-skiied down the glacier to the cabin and home. For safety, it is best to stay on the right side where there may be fewer crevasses.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Rating: \u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666<br \/>\nDifficulty:<\/strong> Challenging D3<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Elevation gain:<\/strong> 1116m (3662&#8242;)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Key elevations:<\/strong> Gibson Lake Parking lot and TH.\u00a01536m (5040\u2032); Keyhole trailhead 1982m (6500&#8242;);Keyhole 2652m (8700&#8242;); Esmeralda Peak 2790m (9154&#8242;); Battleship 2610m(8563&#8242;); Kokanee Lake 1975m (6480\u2032)<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Distance:<\/strong> 11km round trip<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Time:<\/strong> 6-7 hours<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Season:<\/strong> early July through mid-October<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Access:<\/strong> easy\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Map:<\/strong> 82F\/11 Kokanee Creek<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Trail\/Route:<\/strong> Follow the directions from Gibson Lake to Kokanee Glacier.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">3.3km 1 hour &#8211; A signpost states it is 1.2km farther to Kokanee Lake. Just beyond, look up to the right to see the route you will be taking. 150m further, at 1982m (6500&#8242;), the unsigned Keyhole trail forks right and ascends north.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A trail exists for possibly half the way. Initially, it traverses to the north and then switches back to the SE.

The final pitch is steep through big boulders.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A cairn and Kokanee Glacier are immediately in front of you. The summits along the ridge line are very close. Both knowledge level and equipment will determine how far you go. Venturing onto the glacier requires a rope and crevasse rescue skills.

Turn left (northwest) and follow the ridge line to the green repeater on the high point of the ridge line. The views down to Kokanee Lake 2500 feet below, are dramatic.
