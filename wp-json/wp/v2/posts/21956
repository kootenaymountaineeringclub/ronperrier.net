I flew from Xian to Jiuzhaigou Airport. A 40 km bus <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">stopped for 4 hours in Huanglong National Park and continued to Jiuzhalgou NP making it very convenient to see both in one day<em>.<\/em> Both these parks are expensive with a 220\u00a5 entrance fee. Add 80\u00a5 for the cable car in Huanglong and 90\u00a5 for the bus in Jiuzhalgou, and each visit costs $50. The \u2018trails\u2019 in both parks are constructed boardwalks. Despite that, this is spectacular nature and worth the time and money. Both are Unesco World Heritage listed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>HUANGLONG NATIONAL PARK<br \/>\n<\/strong>It is located in the southern part of the Minshan mountain range, 370 kilometres north-northwest of Chengdu. This area is known for its colourful pools formed by calcite deposits, especially in Huanglonggou (Yellow Dragon Gully), as well as diverse forest ecosystems, snow-capped peaks, waterfalls and hot springs. Huanglong is also home to many endangered species including the giant panda and the Sichuan golden snub-nosed monkey. Huanglong was declared a World Heritage Site in 1992.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">We caught the cable car up the mountain. From the cable car is a level boardwalk at 3560m. It climbs minimally around a high lake and then descends the valley past a stunning collection of small, terraced travertine ponds containing bright blue and turquoise water.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" nofocus\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https:\/\/tse2-mm.cn.bing.net\/th\/id\/OIP-C.ABENzUf2rnx9SlJBPGb4cwHaE7?w=1070&amp;h=712&amp;rs=1&amp;pid=ImgDetMain\" alt=\"Huanglong, national park, China, Asia, province, Sichuan, UNESCO, world ...\" width=\"621\" height=\"413\" aria-label=\"Huanglong, national park, China, Asia, province, Sichuan, UNESCO, world ...\" data-bm=\"6\" \/><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" nofocus\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https:\/\/inspirationseek.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Huanglong-National-Park-China-Pictures-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Huanglong National Park, China - InspirationSeek.com\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" aria-label=\"Huanglong National Park, China - InspirationSeek.com\" data-bm=\"6\" \/><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br \/>\nThe yellow rock often cascades down long slopes and the water falls over 10m travertine waterfalls. We took 4 hours to make the circuit down the valley. Taking the cable car was necessary.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The forest is a great mix of large pine, larch and cypress trees, and rhododendrons and azaleas, that bloom in the spring and summer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>JIUZHALGOU NATIONAL PARK<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">We then had a 3-hour drive to Jiuzhalgou. The major ethnic group here is Tibetan with traditional 2-story houses decorated classically. Buddhism reigns supreme with stupas and prayer flags concentrated in the villages. There were originally nine Tibetan villages (Jiuzhalgou means \u2018Nine Village Valley) here but now only three are inhabited. Summer is busiest but October is the best time to see fall colors at their peak.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There are many hostels near the national park entrance. I lucked out and stayed in a room with two great young Chinese men with good English. One booked my bus to Chengdu and I spent the entire day hiking with the other in Jiuzhalgou. Gordon was an intelligent, well-read guy with a great worldview. I had a chance to explore all sorts of Chinese cultural issues. he stated that he thought China was more successful than other BRIC countries because Chinese were much more hard-working.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">We were up at 05:30 to have breakfast and get to the entrance before 07:00 when tickets go on sale. The line-ups can be prodigious and as this was a Sunday, crowds were anticipated to be huge. This is the most popular national park in China. My ticket was half-price (age 60-69) and they are free if over 70. I forgot to ask at Huanglong.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">We were on the first bus. The buses are hop-on-hop-off and have a video that gives a complete tour-guide experience talking about the park and each attraction as you pass it with stilted English subtitles. After about 14 km, the road splits. The western side has many more attractions.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The mountains and trees were covered in fresh snow with the peaks obscured. Because of the snow, we were let off at Arrow Bamboo Lake and started walking in 3\u201d of snow. You then pass a series of perfect turquoise lakes and waterfalls. At Mirror Lake, descend to the fantastic 300 m-long Nourilang Waterfall that drops 15m over a shelf of travertine.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It is a short walk up to the Nourilang junction to catch the bus up the eastern valley, 18 km to Long Lake. Again in the snow, it was a short walk down to Colored Lake also deep turquoise. The crowds were massive by this time. Walk down to another bus stop for the drive back to the junction then the 14 km back to the park entrance. Pass two Tibetan Villages, many-coloured lakes, and waterfalls to the rushing Zechawa River on the boardwalk. It was a long walking day in one of the more beautiful parts of the world. I don\u2019t believe there are lakes like this anywhere else.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"detailCanvas\" class=\"\">\n<div id=\"mainImageRegion\" class=\" isvctrl nsp mainImageRegionView\" data-ufmc=\"savim1\" data-sfmc=\"savim2\" data-svitminfp=\"{&quot;SourceAttr&quot;:&quot;data-m&quot;,&quot;Mapping&quot;:&quot;murl:MediaUrl,purl:PageUrl,mid:MediaId&quot;,&quot;Loc&quot;:&quot;C&quot;,&quot;ItemTagPath&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;AttachToElementSelector&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;AttachDelay&quot;:0}\" data-svptnk=\"Images\" data-svptnerinfo=\"{&quot;PredefinedCollectionType&quot;:&quot;ImageDefault&quot;,&quot;Title&quot;:&quot;Saved Images&quot;,&quot;CollectionId&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;ItemType&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;APIItemType&quot;:&quot;images&quot;,&quot;CollectionTagPath&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-svloc=\"mainImageWindow\" data-svattr=\"data-m\" data-svmdcmp=\"IDPMainImage\" data-svcptid=\"MainImage\" data-persbtncls=\"psvctrl\">\n<div>\n<div id=\"mainImageContainer\">\n<div id=\"mainImageViewer\">\n<div id=\"mainImageWindow\" data-m=\"{&quot;mid&quot;:&quot;96917D9A35EF5B38E61A1E48B64EC81F6970A84F&quot;,&quot;purl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.i-to-i.com\/tefl-blog\/teaching-english-asia\/hiking-stunning-jiuzhaigou-national-park-china\/&quot;,&quot;murl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.i-to-i.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/lake-body-image.jpg&quot;,&quot;turl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/ts3.cn.mm.bing.net\/th?id=OIP-C.sDXDOHkI6eXj6zOWYPXLnAHaFJ&amp;pid=Api&quot;}\">\n<div class=\"mainImage wide notbkg current curimgonview\" role=\"main\">\n<div class=\"richImage \">\n<div class=\"mainContainer \">\n<div class=\"imgContainer\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" nofocus\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https:\/\/www.i-to-i.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/lake-body-image.jpg\" alt=\"Hiking in Stunning Jiuzhaigou National Park, China | An i-to-i Blog\" width=\"621\" height=\"431\" aria-label=\"Hiking in Stunning Jiuzhaigou National Park, China | An i-to-i Blog\" \/><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hgTdJ7FrI7g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwim9bzHvN3fAhXZHTQIHXP0BxoQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/hgTdJ7FrI7g\/maxresdefault.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for JIUZHAIGOU NATIONAL PARK\" width=\"620\" height=\"349\" data-src=\"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/hgTdJ7FrI7g\/maxresdefault.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br \/>\nA comparable place is Havasu Creek, west of Grand Canyon National Park in the Havasupai Indian Reservation in Northern Arizona. It has two much higher waterfalls, the same turquoise water, travertine, and a gorgeous eight-mile hike to the Colorado River, but no lakes or ponds. The intense colour of the water is also comparable to many of the geyser fields in Yellowstone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Travertine<\/strong> is a form of limestone deposited by mineral springs, especially hot springs. Travertine exists in white, tan, cream-coloured, and even rusty varieties. It is formed by the rapid precipitation of calcium carbonate from solution in ground and surface waters. Supersaturated alkaline waters degas CO2 increasing pH. Since carbonate solubility decreases with increased pH, precipitation is induced.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In a limestone cave, it can form stalactites, stalagmites, and other speleothems. Macrophytes, bryophytes, algae, cyanobacteria, and other organisms often colonize the surface of travertine and are preserved, giving travertine its distinctive porosity. Tufa is similar but softer and extremely porous and forms in ambient-temperature water. Some springs have temperatures high enough to exclude organisms and are less porous than tufa.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When pure and fine, travertine is white, but often brown to yellow due to impurities.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Travertine is often used as a building material. The Romans mined travertine for building temples, aqueducts, monuments, bath complexes, and amphitheatres such as the Colosseum, the largest building in the world constructed mostly of travertine. Other notable buildings using travertine extensively include the Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur Basilica in Paris, the 20th-century Getty Center in Los Angeles, California, and Shell-Haus in Berlin. These latter two used imported travertine from Tivoli and Guidonia in Italy.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Travertine is one of several natural stones used for fa\u00e7ades, wall cladding, and flooring especially paving patio and garden paths. The relative softness of the stone, combined with its pitted holes and troughs, make travertine flooring difficult to finish and maintain<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Italy had a near-monopoly on the world travertine market but now significant supplies are quarried in mainly Turkey, Iran, Mexico and Peru. Two or three small travertine producers operate in the western United States. U.S. demand for travertine is about 0.85 million tons per year, almost all imported.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>DRAGON\u2019S BACKBONE RICE TERRACES<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Transportation:<em> Bus to Guilin, city bus to the Qintan Bus Station, bus to Longsheng but get off at Heping, bus to the bottom of <strong>Ping\u2019an<\/strong> turn off, and then hitchhiked 6 km up the hill in the back of a truck carrying freshly cut wood with a great aroma.

They are old, short and very cute. The terraces rise to 1000m high surrounding Ping\u2019an and are a major engineering feat. The irrigation system is intriguing. Tiny cement canals carry water in the terraces.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" nofocus\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https:\/\/ts1.cn.mm.bing.net\/th\/id\/R-C.43736b2b369912353a3040fb57b86553?rik=brsBpjaOPOBQ1A&amp;riu=http%3a%2f%2fwww.genkin.org%2fgallery%2flandscapes%2fcountry-rural%2fchina-longsheng-longji%2fchina-longsheng-0008.jpg&amp;ehk=zXkFPGq%2bOPA50f1l7as86Jkn9L5fj9V0Yjfr%2bbRlDLc%3d&amp;risl=&amp;pid=ImgRaw&amp;r=0\" alt=\"Dragon's Backbone Rice Terraces, Longji, Longsheng, Guangxi, China ...\" width=\"619\" height=\"412\" aria-label=\"Dragon's Backbone Rice Terraces, Longji, Longsheng, Guangxi, China ...\" data-bm=\"6\" \/><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\" role=\"button\" src=\"https:\/\/tse1-mm.cn.bing.net\/th\/id\/OIP-C.hPinc_OZd8ELdefKl83n6QHaE8?rs=1&amp;pid=ImgDetMain\" alt=\"Guilin, China: Dragon's Backbone Rice Terraces Day! - i put my life on ...\" width=\"617\" height=\"411\" \/><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" nofocus\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https:\/\/ts1.cn.mm.bing.net\/th\/id\/R-C.f1714a925f20d2dc12ed32fda61cffa6?rik=brIQOm%2buz7FGlg&amp;riu=http%3a%2f%2fwww.maierandmaierphotography.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2013%2f03%2fdazhai-wokring-at-longji-rice-terraces-china.jpg&amp;ehk=wkr6Y7Ov54HnsmWyrqdqIQ6o1t9fSmT0NaaJKYHx62E%3d&amp;risl=&amp;pid=ImgRaw&amp;r=0\" alt=\"Dragon's Backbone Rice Terraces in Guanxi, China | Travel &amp; Documentary ...\" width=\"615\" height=\"410\" aria-label=\"Dragon's Backbone Rice Terraces in Guanxi, China | Travel &amp; Documentary ...\" data-bm=\"6\" \/><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br \/>\nThe next morning at 7:30 I left to do the wonderful 4-hour hike through the rice terraces and the minority villages of Zhongliu and Tiantouzhal arriving at Dazhai. Start uphill to the Seven Stars with the Moon viewpoint and crosse the top of the terraces to the Nine Dragons and Five Tigers viewpoint. Turn left to a cement road and follow the road uphill. It becomes rough gravel, goes over a small dam and eventually turns into a path through a cemetery and some rice paddies. The graves are randomly built into the banks and have an elaborate lintel over a small stone door covered in characters. I presume they tell the life story of the deceased. Eventually, the path climbs up to a viewpoint where one can see the route ahead meandering through rice terraces, and the rooftops of Zhonglu village before going over a small pass towards Dazhai.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">For many reasons, I decided to turn around. The schematic map was not to scale and I thought I&#8217;d have difficulties getting a bus to the Ping\u2019an turnoff, the 6km road up the mountainside to walk up to the hostel to get my pack and walk back. When it started to rain, it was an easy decision.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>With my pack, I walked down the 6 km road, put my thumb out and got a ride with an old guy on a motorcycle. At the bottom, I gave him 20\u00a5 and asked if he was going to Heping. In Heping, I gave him another 10\u00a5, he gave a big smile and patted his gas tank. We were both happy. The best 5 bucks I have ever spent!<br \/>\nWhile waiting for the bus to Longsheng, I hitchhiked again with a young couple with just enough English to make it fun. They dropped me off at the Longsheng bus station and I got the bus to Sanjiang waiting only 25 minutes.

Some 243 peaks and more than 3000 pinnacles and columns dominate the landscape. 198 columns are 200-300m high and 48 are over 300m high. <strong>Jinbian Rock<\/strong> is the highest at 380m. The 15km long\u00a0<strong>Jinbian Brook<\/strong> has the highest concentration of columns with 400.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The columns of rock are formed by tectonic forces and water weathering. Although resembling karst terrain, this area is not underlain by limestones and is not the product of the chemical dissolution characteristic of limestone karst. They result from many years of physical, rather than chemical, erosion, most from expanding ice in the winter and the plants that grow on them. They rise almost square in shape straight up from the valley floors. The weather is moist year-round, and as a result, the foliage is very dense. It is home to a wide biodiversity of plants and animals including macaques, giant salamanders and clouded leopards. 20 million visit the park annually.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">One of the park\u2019s quartz-sandstone pillars, the 1,080-metre (3,540 ft) Southern Sky Column, was officially renamed \u201cAvatar Hallelujah Mountain\u201d in honour of the film in January 2010.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The towering Bailong Elevator, literally \u2018hundred dragons sky lift\u2019, was opened in 2002.

I caught a bus to the <strong>Bailong Sky Lift,<\/strong>\u00a0a cliff-side elevator that rises 335m to access the<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">4.\u00a0<strong>Yuanjiajie Scenic Area<\/strong> in the middle of the park. The viewpoints from the top of the elevator look over a sea of columns. After the elevator is a 5-minute walk, then an 8-minute bus ride through a boring bit before coming to a walk on the edge of a cliff with Shadao Stream more than 300m straight down. The clouds and mist cleared enough to get good views of the fantastic columns. A natural bridge 300m above the floor is crossed at one point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" nofocus\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https:\/\/www.chinadiscovery.com\/assets\/images\/travel-guide\/zhangjiajie\/yuanjiajie\/yuanjiajia-backyard-garden.jpg\" alt=\"Yuanjiajie, Yuanjiajie Scenic Area, to See Hallelujah Mountains\" width=\"620\" height=\"413\" aria-label=\"Yuanjiajie, Yuanjiajie Scenic Area, to See Hallelujah Mountains\" \/><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I then boarded a bus with several possible stops:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">5.

The other option is the Tianzi Cableway which descends through fantastic columns to the main road and the bus that returns to the Wulinyuan Entrance. The top was socked in, raining and cold, and I opted for the cableway to return to Zhangjiajie City and my comfy hotel room.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There are easily three full days of hiking available in Zhangjiajie National Park. Crowds were large on this rainy, cold, no-view Tuesday in late November. I can only imagine what they might be like on a weekend in peak season with a nice day. The ethereal landscape here is not to be missed. Nothing else like it exists in the world.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I don\u2019t think I have seen so many signs with stilted English as in this park. The signs are large wood billboards, rocks with incised letters and other expensive productions. Brochures are poorly translated. Names of viewpoints and natural features are very poetic. There was an unfortunate amount of garbage littering the trees below the cliffs despite many garbage cans. Trails are also littered with signs warning of dangers: slippery paths, rockfalls, and falling into creeks. Chinese need a lot of babysitting. Everything has a long list of rules of behaviour and problems. A small bench swing on the Yangzi tour boat had 6 instructions on safe use! Maybe they find Chinese as non-intuitive as I do.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"entry-author-info\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">DANXIA\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Near Zhangye, Gansu Province, I saw <strong>Danxia Rocks National GeoPark<\/strong> \u2013 six multicoloured rock formations recently inscribed as Unesco World Heritage Sites. The swirling rainbow palette and the scale of the formations are lovely. These are mudstone\/flowstone formations \u2013 clay-based soft earth in layers. The area is like Dante\u2019s Viewpoint in Death Valley NP (the surrounding mountains are also similar) and the colours are similar to the Bentonite Hills of Capital Reef NP or the hills around the Paria townsite area. A shuttle bus takes you between four viewpoints. A taxi is the only way to get there.<\/p>\n<p><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"detailCanvas\" class=\"\">\n<div id=\"mainImageRegion\" class=\" isvctrl nsp mainImageRegionView\"
