Situated on the coast and site the best anchorage in Nevis, the town boasts many 19th century buildings. Georgian architecture is the prevalent type with about half of the existing structure coming from the 1850 to 1900 period.

A well-preserved 17th- and 18th-century military architecture in a Caribbean context. Located on St Kitts, it was designed by the British and built by African slave labour, the fortress is testimony to European colonial expansion and the African slave trade.<br \/>\nIt is built on a double-peaked, steep volcanic hill rising 230 metres to protect the coastline from a sea attack and to provide a safe refuge for the island\u2019s citizens. St. Christopher (St. Kitts) as the first West Indian Island to be colonized by Europeans, specifically the French and English, was the scene of many battles in the struggle for dominance in this region. The earliest use of Brimstone Hill for European military purposes was in 1690 when the British installed a canon to drive out the French. The fortress evolved over the next century and served until 1853 when the British military abandoned it and dismantled many of the buildings.<br \/>\nThe principal structures are on different levels of the upper third of the hill and were constructed in dressed stone (basalt) blocks with a rubble core. Local limestone was used as a decorative element for quoins and for facing round doorways and embrasures. Quarries on the middle and lower slopes of the hill provided much of the stone. The heart of the fortress, Fort George also known as the Citadel, dominates one of the twin peaks. Completed towards the end of the 1700s, this is the earliest surviving example of the \u201cPolygonal System\u201d of fortress design. The entire site covers approximately 15 hectares surrounded by a 1.6 km (1 mile) buffer zone. Has\u00a0stunning views over the surrounding area and even some nearby islands.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BASSETERRE<\/strong>\u00a0(pop 15,000)\u00a0is the capital of the country of St.Kitts and Nevis, and is the main commercial centre.
