you\u2019re not a fan of hummus, tabouli, or olives, it\u2019s worth giving the Mediterranean diet a chance. Why? Because when it comes to the hierarchy of healthy eating patterns, the Mediterranean diet consistently comes out on top.<\/p>\n<p>In 2023,\u00a0<i>U.S. News and World Report<\/i>\u00a0ranked it #1 overall, as well as giving it first place as the best diet for healthy eating and for being the best plant-based diet. It\u2019s delicious and nutritious, and consuming it is associated with a variety of health benefits. It is also easy to follow and sustainable for the long haul. And you don\u2019t need to live in a Mediterranean country or even leave home to adhere to the eponymous diet or reap its benefits.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt seems to be the universal love donor\u2014it has real foods, predominantly plants, and it offers pleasure,\u201d says David Katz, a preventive medicine specialist, past president of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine, and co-author of\u00a0<i>How to Eat.\u00a0<\/i>\u201cIt captures the fundamentals of whole nutrition\u2014it takes us out of the realm of quick fixes and into the realm of lifestyle.

The Mediterranean diet builds vitality and [helps prevent] chronic diseases that shorten our lives.\u201d\u00a0<b>\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<h2>The diet\u2019s origins and core foods<\/h2>\n<p>The Mediterranean diet dates back to the 1950s when Ancel Keys, a physiologist from Minnesota, came up with the idea for the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sevencountriesstudy.com\/about-the-study\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Seven Countries Study<\/a>. The study brought together a team of researchers to investigate the associations between diet, other lifestyle factors, and cardiovascular disease in the U.S., Italy, Greece, Finland, The Netherlands, the former Yugoslavia, and Japan.<\/p>\n<p>Besides finding links between people\u2019s dietary patterns, their blood cholesterol levels, and their risk of coronary heart disease, the researchers also discovered that those who lived in certain countries around the Mediterranean Sea had lower rates of cardiovascular disease and premature mortality from any cause than participants who lived in other areas.<\/p>\n<p>What these regions also had in common: People in Greece, Italy, and other Mediterranean countries consume diets that are rich in predominantly plant-based foods.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/oldwayspt.org\/traditional-diets\/mediterranean-diet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The core foods include<\/a>\u00a0whole grains, fruits, vegetables, beans, legumes, nuts, seeds, herbs, spices, and healthy fats such as extra virgin olive oil. Moderate amounts of lean proteins (such as fish, seafood, and poultry) are encouraged, as are eggs, dairy products such as yogurt, and wine (red wine, in particular, with meals). By contrast, red meats and sweets are meant to be consumed less often. Over time, this healthy eating pattern came to be known as the Mediterranean diet.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a balanced diet\u2014the principles are simple, and it\u2019s not exclusionary, which is something a lot of people appreciate,\u201d says Keith Ayoob, a dietitian in New York City and an associate professor emeritus of pediatrics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, this healthy eating pattern is inherently flexible. \u201cThe Mediterranean diet contains healthy elements from all food groups\u2014whole grains, which are complex carbs, healthy fats such as olive oil and omega-3 fatty acids, and lean protein,\u201d notes Nieca Goldberg, a cardiologist, and associate professor of medicine at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine. \u201cThere\u2019s something for everyone in the diet.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop ImageGroup__Wrapper\" aria-label=\"Image Pair\" data-bumper-index=\"2\">\n<div class=\"ImageGroup__Images\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure id=\"7e8ecd29-e685-4f87-a3c5-c2a514292326_0\" class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/885263fa-e3b4-48b0-890a-347563d3f510\/NationalGeographic_580652-2.jpg?w=2303.9999389648438&amp;h=1542.5999591350555\" alt=\"Green olives are photographed from bellow.\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"CenterCropFrame\">\n<div class=\"CenterCropFrame__Frame\">\n<div class=\"CenterCropFrame__Child-Wrap\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure id=\"7e8ecd29-e685-4f87-a3c5-c2a514292326_1\" class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent\">\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/b43f1adf-d345-41b1-aec7-6f59efe98658\/NationalGeographic_2167649-2.jpg?w=2303.9999389648438&amp;h=1762.1999533176422\" alt=\"Deep green leaves and beautifuly colored orange tree under a peaceful sky.\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption Caption--hideEndBug\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\"><strong>Left<\/strong>: Olives are a fruit and the main source of heart-healthy fat in the Mediterranean diet.
