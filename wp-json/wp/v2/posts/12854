To enter it, you pass tight security at Aramco\u2019s suburban-style headquarters in Dhahran, in the east of the kingdom. The transition is eye-opening. Suddenly, English is the common tongue even among Saudi \u201cAramcons\u201d, as its workers are known. Female employees, their faces uncovered, lead meetings of male colleagues. The crisp banter is common to engineers everywhere. A toilet break is called a \u201cpressure-relief\u201d exercise.<br \/>\nDeep within, OSPAS is even further removed from the kingdom outside. The few executives with clearance to enter call it the \u201cnerve centre\u201d of the world\u2019s largest oil company. Using 100,000 sensors and data points on wells, pipelines, plants and terminals, it directs every drop of oil and cubic foot of gas that comes out of the kingdom (10% of the world\u2019s oil supply), monitors it on giant screens as it heads to ports and power stations, and tracks oil tankers as they load. Well managers in the desert outback wait daily for OSPAS to tell them what to do. \u201cIt\u2019s not just pretty graphics,\u201d an executive says, purring appreciatively over the 70-metre web of data flashing on the wall.<br \/>\nBecause Aramco has all its \u201cupstream\u201d oil-and-gas operations in one country, it says it can justify investing big sums\u2014and a lot of computer capacity\u2014on such technology, because it helps cut costs. \u201cExxonMobil operates in 40-plus countries. It just can\u2019t do that,\u201d the executive adds, before apologising lest he appear to bad-mouth a client and partner, one of Aramco\u2019s American founding former shareholders.<br \/>\nSuch comparisons will become more pertinent as Aramco opens itself up for an initial public offering (IPO). Until recently it was just as cloistered from outside scrutiny as the kingdom itself, giving it more of a mystique than a good reputation. This week it invited\u00a0<em>The Economist\u00a0<\/em>for a visit. It only partially lifted its veil; its finances remain off-limits to everyone except the government, its only shareholder. Affable executives dodge almost every attempt to wheedle out useful ways of comparing the firm with its listed peers (it has no peers, they dissemble).<br \/>\nBut despite the hermeticism, Aramco has a good tale to tell. Even as its rivals have retrenched owing to low prices, it has stuck to long-term plans, investing heavily in technology, training and the future of oil. Its long-term approach may help explain one mystery. For decades, Saudi Arabia\u2019s declared oil reserves have confounded the industry; since 1989 they have remained suspiciously constant at around 260bn barrels\u2014a dozen times those of Aramco\u2019s nearest listed rival. As if to rub it in, Aramco says the kingdom has a whopping 400bn further barrels of resources that could one day become reserves.<br \/>\nThese reserves are under audit ahead of the IPO, and executives are loth to discuss the process. However, they argue that whereas other companies have to go far to find new reserves, Aramco can keep them constant simply by better stewardship of its existing fields. Amin Nasser, the chief executive, says the company\u2019s recovery rates\u2014the share of oil recouped from what is available in a field\u2014average about 50%, but rise as high as 70%, compared with a global average of about 33%. It does this by maintaining the pressure of its wells over the long term through gas re-injection and other means. Raising recovery rates on average to 70% would add 80bn barrels to reserves, an executive says. That is four times ExxonMobil\u2019s latest total.<br \/>\nUnlike big listed companies, which scrapped growth plans when the price of oil slumped in 2014-16, Aramco has also been able to keep on investing because of its low costs, Mr Nasser says. Increasing natural-gas output is now the main focus, but it has also raised oil production in some areas. This is visible at the vast Shaybah field in Saudi Arabia\u2019s blisteringly hot Empty Quarter, where Aramco last year upped oil output by 250,000 barrels a day (b\/d) to 1m b\/d, inaugurated a facility to process natural-gas liquids and laid 650km of new pipelines across a mountain range of red sand dunes. (Aramco also set out to repopulate the surrounding desert with oryx, gazelle and ostrich hunted almost to extinction. They are now reproducing, although the first ostrich eggs to fertilise sadly cooked in the heat.)<br \/>\nIts second focus is technology. Whereas some of its peers admit that they squandered the chance to invest in big data during the oil boom before 2014, Aramco has no such regrets. Last year it inaugurated its home-grown \u201cTeraPowers\u201d technology, which uses 1trn pixel-like computational cells to simulate the flow of hydrocarbons through 500m years of geological time, enabling it to model oilfields in granular detail. From Dhahran it can remotely direct drilling of horizontal wells in Shaybah, steering a drill-bit through miles of rock to within a few feet of its target. (Royal Dutch Shell recently boasted of using similar remote-drilling technology in Argentina.) To train young employees in understanding the subsurface, Aramco has a 3D virtual-reality \u201ccave\u201d in Dhahran, which shows the filigree of wells 1,500 metres below the surface of Shaybah, as if from a submarine.<br \/>\nThird, as Saudi Arabia\u2019s most attractive employer, Aramco has less difficulty than its Western peers in attracting millennial recruits (born between around 1980 and 1996) who are turning away from the oil and gas industry. It has kept up spending on international scholarships during the slump. It plans to raise the share of women in the workforce from 25% to 40%. Its chief engineer and head of human resources are both female. Saudi labour laws still apply, however: female Aramcons may not stay overnight at an oilfield.<br \/>\nAramcons pride themselves on a Westernised culture handed down from their American forefathers before nationalisation in 1980. This makes them confident they can handle the listing. \u201cFrom the way [Aramco] was built, from the beginning I would say it was ready for an IPO,\u201d Mr Nasser says. The main change, he adds, will be issuing quarterly results.<br \/>\nBut that underplays the challenges ahead. For one thing, Aramco is not master of its destiny. The future of the IPO, such as the decision on where and when to list, is in the hands of the government shareholder, represented by Muhammad bin Salman, the crown prince. Domestic political tension and external frictions with Qatar risk delaying the IPO until 2019\u2014and further muddying the waters.<br \/>\nThe potential valuation is also contentious. MBS, as the crown prince is known, has said he believes Aramco is worth $2trn, though many analysts think that is over-ambitious. To improve its chances, the kingdom is leaning toward a listing on the New York Stock Exchange rather than in London, because America has deeper pools of capital. However, that would expose Aramco to legal risks it would prefer to avoid. In order to bring in Chinese investors, the kingdom is also considering issuing some shares in Hong Kong.<br \/>\nHowever strong Aramco may be upstream, its lower-margin refining and petrochemicals divisions will drag down the valuation. Aramco has some intriguing plans to mitigate this, hoping in the next few years to build a plant with new technology to turn crude oil directly into petrochemicals\u2014in essence, leap-frogging refineries. But this is untested.<br \/>\nIn sum, the IPO is more for the kingdom\u2019s benefit than Aramco\u2019s. It could have drawbacks\u2014exposing the firm to investors with short time horizons or to activists hostile to fossil fuels. But the Aramcons appear determined to make the most of it. Executives argue that oil\u2019s future is bright, even if electric cars and cleaner fuels emerge. Low costs mean there is no danger Saudi oil will become a \u201csunset industry\u201d, says Mohammed al-Qahtani, head of its upstream division. A listing will make Aramco \u201cthe envy of the rest of the world\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The World&#8217;s Biggest IPO<\/strong><br \/>\n<em>Saudi Aramco cannot be seen in isolation from the kingdom it funds<br \/>\n<\/em>June 24th 2017 Economist<\/p>\n<p>The proposed sale of 5% of Saudi Aramco is not just likely to be the biggest initial public offering (IPO) of all time. \u201cIt\u2019s like Gibraltar selling the rock,\u201d as one expert on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil policy puts it. The world\u2019s biggest oil company keeps the House of Saud in power, bankrolled 60% of the national budget last year, and is a paragon of efficiency in an economy otherwise mired in bureaucracy.<br \/>\nThe elevation on June 21st of Muhammad bin Salman, the 31-year-old architect of the IPO, to crown prince is likely to add more momentum to a sale planned for the second half of 2018. The news will further sideline domestic critics of the IPO, some of whom wonder whether it would be better to borrow the money than sell the family silver. But the success of the IPO is not guaranteed. The tendency of MBS, as the prince is known, to micromanage the listing runs counter to the spirit of openness and liberalisation that he says he wants for Saudi Arabia. That could backfire on the IPO itself. The more he interferes, the less keen investors will be to buy shares.<br \/>\nAramco\u2019s role underpinning the Saudi economy is an even bigger challenge in valuing this IPO than the firm\u2019s immense size. On the one hand, advisers say, its low costs and lean workforce make it comparable to blue-chip oil supermajors such as ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell. On the other, the risks of political interference mean that it is likely to suffer from the stigma associated with being a national oil company (NOC). Many NOCs, such as PetroChina and Brazil\u2019s Petrobras, have come to market amid the sort of fanfare that Aramco is generating. In a decade, they have destroyed more than $500bn-worth of value compared with their private peers.<br \/>\nAs an oil company, the selling-points for Aramco are strong (provided the oil price is high enough). It has a concession for 12 times more oil and gas than ExxonMobil and 27 times more than Shell. Its production levels are several times higher. It has fewer employees, higher debt-adjusted cashflow per barrel, and decent margins in its refining and petrochemicals businesses as well as upstream. By the time it lists, its advisers hope it will have a board structure similar to that of the supermajors, and will be comparable on a number of parameters, including dividend projections, that will enable investors to value it accordingly. \u201cThe day this company goes public, it will look like one of the top blue-chip oil companies,\u201d one says.<br \/>\nThe trouble is, MBS has already stated what he thinks the valuation should be, and at $2trn, it is punchy enough to make even a Silicon Valley boss look bashful. To achieve it, a 5% sliver would be worth $100bn\u2014four times the biggest IPO to date, that of China\u2019s Alibaba, an e-commerce firm, in 2014.<br \/>\nAccording to an analysis by Sanford C. Bernstein, a research firm, at $2trn its value per barrel of oil equivalent coming out of the ground would be about 60% higher than that of its blue-chip peers. A valuation at or below $1.5trn would be closer to the mark, but risks disappointing the new crown prince. \u201cHe may have to make a choice between selling cheap and pulling the plug on the process. Either case would be a loss of face,\u201d says Steffen Hertog of the London School of Economics, a writer on the state and oil in Saudi Arabia.<br \/>\nTo get closer to his target, the kingdom recently slashed tax rates on Aramco, from 85% to 50%. That brings them nearer to international norms for oil firms and will appeal to investors: lower taxes mean the company can pay out higher dividends.<br \/>\nThe country also has a plan to wean its people off some of the world\u2019s cheapest energy by 2020, which would bolster Aramco\u2019s profits. According to Jim Krane, of Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy, about a third of Aramco\u2019s output is sold for domestic purposes, with power generation, for instance, enjoying discounted prices of under $6 a barrel\u2014a \u201cmassive opportunity cost\u201d.<br \/>\nBut investors would be wise not to view issues like taxes and subsidies in isolation. Some analysts express worry that dividends are unstable, and that the kingdom would have to unwind the tax cuts on Aramco if the state needed the money. The introduction of more realistic pricing could also have political and social ramifications, since Saudis are some of the world\u2019s biggest consumers of cheap energy.<br \/>\nAnother worry for investors would be if MBS continues to use Aramco as a tool of global oil policy on behalf of OPEC, the producers\u2019 cartel. The kingdom may believe that OPEC serves as a stabilising force in global oil markets, which benefits Aramco. But its latest attempts to play puppet-master with the oil market have been counter-productive. On June 21st (2017) global oil prices fell to their lowest level since August, despite an agreement by OPEC and non-OPEC producers to cut output until next March. As a result, Aramco is not only losing income, it is losing market share to rivals not bound by the cuts.<br \/>\nLast, as his global stature grows, the prince may be tempted to mix up geopolitics and commerce. Anecdotal evidence of this emerged during President Donald Trump\u2019s visit to Riyadh in May. Even as Aramco was supposedly disentangling itself from the myriad noncore activities it carries out on behalf of the state, the firm was on extra-curricular duty. At breakneck pace, it built the Global Centre for Combating Extremist Ideology in Riyadh, where Mr Trump and MBS\u2019s 81-year-old father, King Salman bin Abdel Aziz Al Saud, performed a weird inauguration ceremony involving a glowing globe. The reason for Aramco\u2019s involvement: no other body in the kingdom could do it half as quickly.<br \/>\nSuch strategic considerations may also be influencing the decision on whether to list the non-Saudi portion of the IPO in New York or London (a small slice will be listed on Tadawul, the local bourse). Aramco\u2019s lawyers are more comfortable with a London Stock Exchange (LSE) listing, on the ground that it would spare the company the real risk of class-action lawsuits related, for instance, to the terror attacks of September 11th 2001, of litigation from tree-hugging attorneys-general, and of other claims on its assets that it might face on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).<br \/>\nBut MBS is believed to be leaning more towards New York. This may be because of liquidity: listed companies on the NYSE have a combined market capitalisation of about $20trn, versus $4trn on the LSE. The NYSE also has more prestige; the big peers Aramco wants to be judged against are listed there. Yet he is also understood to have been under pressure from the White House for a New York listing, and is keen to cement ties with Mr Trump. If that were to sway the final consideration, investors might not thank him for it.<br \/>\nMany will shrug. The chance to buy shares in one of the world\u2019s most resilient oil firms will be hard to resist. Moreover, sovereign-wealth funds may well be keen to become \u201canchor tenants\u201d of the IPO, to deepen their own countries\u2019 relationships with Aramco and the new crown prince.<br \/>\nBut MBS\u2019s leapfrog towards the throne will not silence the questions that still swirl. What will happen to the money raised? Will the listing plug a budget gap of 8% of GDP? Will it fund domestic industries such as mining, defence and tourism? Or will it become a \u201cmagic money tree\u201d, promising all things to all people? The original goal of the IPO was to bring more transparency and stronger market forces to Saudi Arabia\u2014creating a sort of Thatcherite oasis in the Arabian desert. If that is truly what MBS wants, he should learn to leave well alone.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SAUDI WOMEN\u00a0<\/strong><br \/>\n<em>Some Saudi women are secretly deserting their country.<\/em>\u00a0<em>Women are fed up with being treated like children<br \/>\n<\/em>Mar 16th 2017 \/ Economist<\/p>\n<p>Can Saudi Arabia keep its women? Last month\u2019s appointment of women to head two big banks and Tadawul, the kingdom\u2019s stock exchange, offers hope that the path to a fulfilling career is not completely blocked. But the restrictions of Saudi life remain so irksome that covertly, silently, many women are finding ways out.<br \/>\nOn family trips abroad, some jump ship. Some, having been sent to Western universities at the government\u2019s expense, postpone their return indefinitely. Others avail themselves of clandestine online services offering marriages of convenience to men willing to whisk them abroad. Iman, an administrator at a private hospital in Riyadh, has found a package deal for $4,000 offering an Australian honeymoon during which she plans to scarper.<br \/>\nPropelling the flight is the kingdom\u2019s\u00a0<em>wilaya<\/em>, or guardianship, law. Although it has received less publicity than the world\u2019s only sex-specific driving ban, it imposes harsher curbs on female mobility. To travel, work or study abroad, receive hospital treatment or an ID card, or even leave prison once a sentence is served, women need the consent of a male\u00a0<em>wali<\/em>, or guardian. From birth to death, they are handed from one\u00a0<em>wali\u00a0<\/em>to the next\u2014father, husband and, if both of those die, the nearest male relative. Sometimes that might be a teenage son or brother, because although boys are treated as adults from puberty, women are treated as minors all their lives.<br \/>\nIman, a divorcee, is subject to the guardianship of her brother, who at 17 is barely half her age. He lets her work as a manager at a hospital, but pockets her earnings. She says she is kept like a chattel, while he spends her money on drugs and weekends in massage parlours in neighbouring Bahrain. Her ex-husband refuses to let her see their children. Her brother prevents her from completing her studies in Europe. If she protests, he threatens to beat her.<br \/>\nShe tried going to court to have the guardianship transferred to a more sympathetic elder brother, but the judge dismissed the case, she says, while talking on his phone. Though she dressed demurely in a full veil, she suspects the judge objected to her presenting her own case. Social services offer poor refuge, since hostels for abused women resemble prisons where the windows are barred and visitors banned. When she hears other women say that their brothers don\u2019t beat them, Iman assumes they are lying \u201cbecause they are scared of social housing\u201d.<br \/>\nEstimates of the number of \u201crunaway girls\u201d, to use the Saudi term, are imprecise, but, says Mansour al-Askar, a sociologist at Imam Muhammad ibn Saud University in Riyadh, the rate is rising. By his estimates, over a thousand flee the kingdom every year, while more escape Riyadh for Jeddah, the kingdom\u2019s more liberal coastal metropolis.<br \/>\nDissenting Saudi scholars insist that the guardianship laws stem not from Islam, but the Bedouin customs that still hold sway in much of Arabia\u2019s hinterland. Khadija, the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s first wife, was a merchant who sponsored her husband. His subsequent wives moved between Medina and Mecca without him. \u201cIslam freed women from the\u00a0<em>wilaya<\/em>,\u201d says Hassan al-Maliki, a theologian in Riyadh who has sometimes been jailed for free-thinking. \u201cA woman can choose whom she marries.\u201d But the clerics who man the judiciary maintain that guardians protect the vulnerable and keep families and, by extension, society together. Last December the courts sentenced a man caught denouncing the\u00a0<em>wilaya\u00a0<\/em>on social media to a year in jail. Another Saudi study, at a university in Mecca, acknowledged that some runaways might be fleeing physical abuse, but said that most had been influenced by the \u201cmisuse of social media, copying other cultures and weak beliefs\u201d.<br \/>\nEconomists note that the guardianship system makes Saudi Arabia poorer. More than a quarter of the 150,000 students the kingdom sends abroad every year are women. Given that many defer their return or choose to remain in more liberal places like Dubai, much of the $5bn the government spends on their studies each year is going to waste. \u201cSaudi Arabia is losing the battle to keep its talent,\u201d says Najah al-Osaimi, a female Saudi academic who has settled in Britain.<br \/>\nAwkwardly for reformers, some of the most tenacious advocates of the\u00a0<em>wilaya\u00a0<\/em>are women, particularly in obscurantist southern provinces like Asir. Despite such beguiling hashtags as #StopEnslavingSaudiWomen and #IAmMyOwnGuardian, a social-media campaign to end the\u00a0<em>wilaya\u00a0<\/em>system attracted just 14,000 signatures.<br \/>\n<strong>Use them or lose them.\u00a0<\/strong>Saudi Arabia\u2019s leaders acknowledge the need to make the kingdom more women-friendly. Already, more women attend Saudi universities than men. And although some men still send their own photographs when they apply for jobs for their wives (and even attend their interviews), in 2012 the kingdom waived the need for women to have their guardians\u2019 approval for four types of work, including clothes-shop assistants, chefs and amusement-park attendants.<br \/>\nIn upmarket malls, women can be seen selling aftershave, boldly spraying samples onto male hands. Broadminded men can give their female wards five-year permits to move unaccompanied (though they get updates by text message whenever their charges travel abroad). Countrywide, the dress code has relaxed a bit. In big cities, women have added streaks of colour and patterns to the black\u00a0<em>abayas\u00a0<\/em>or cloaks that the state requires them to wear. Even in Burayda, the bastion of Saudi Arabia\u2019s puritanical rite, women have cut slits for their eyes in veils that hitherto fully covered their faces, and let their\u00a0<em>abayas\u00a0<\/em>slip from their heads to their shoulders.<br \/>\nNonetheless many women seethe with frustration. On social media, footage of women riding motorbikes has gone viral. So too has a female silhouette, whisky bottle in hand, dancing on her car roof. A female pop group, clad in black, sings songs of protest from dodgems, toy cars, skateboards, roller-skates and other wheeled vehicles that they can legally drive. Unless the system adapts, warns Mr al-Askar, the sociologist, it risks crumbling. Judges and the police should work together to strip oppressive men of their right to be\u00a0<em>walis<\/em>, he says. But for Iman, the hospital manager, reform can\u2019t come soon enough. An Australian honeymoon awaits.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SAUDI ARAMCO The biggest oil company has a good story to tell\u2014if it can disentangle its image from that of the kingdom Sep 21st 2017 Economist If Saudi Aramco is a state within a state in Saudi Arabia, then the &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2020\/03\/09\/saudi-arabia-today\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-12854","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-uncategorized"],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p2Ncip-3lk","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/12854","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=12854"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/12854\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":12856,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/12854\/revisions\/12856"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=12854"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=12854"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=12854"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
