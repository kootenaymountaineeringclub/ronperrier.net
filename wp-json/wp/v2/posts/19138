But many experts say the underappreciated secret sauce in the diet is its liberal use of extra virgin olive oil as the primary added fat.<\/p>\n<p>While every fruit and vegetable has health-promoting compounds, the ones unique to olive oil, called phenols, are especially powerful, says Mary Flynn, a nutrition researcher and founder of the nonprofit Olive Oil Health Initiative at Brown University. The nutrients in extra virgin olive oil have been found to benefit numerous health conditions, including heart disease and diabetes.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI call the Mediterranean diet a plant-based olive oil diet,\u201d says Flynn, who recently published a review of the science behind the oil and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2072-6643\/15\/13\/2916\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">found dozens of high-quality studies<\/a>\u00a0supporting its healthful effects. \u201cWe have no food or medicine that can do what olive oil can do,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>(<i>Read more about why<\/i>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/premium\/article\/mediterranean-diet-chronic-illness-longevity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i>The Mediterranean diet has stood the test of time<\/i><\/a>.<i>)<\/i><\/p>\n<p>The phenols in extra virgin olive oil are antioxidants, capable of protecting the body\u2019s cells from dangerous molecules, and they also have antimicrobial properties.<br \/>\nLike orange juice, extra virgin olive oil is simply the juice of the olive fruit, albeit juice that is tested to meet quality standards such as not having a musty or rancid smell or taste\u2014an indication that compounds delivering the health benefits have degraded.<br \/>\nOlive oil is one of the very few foods that has a sensory component in its quality standards.<\/p>\n<p>In Greece, Italy, and other parts of the Mediterranean where olive trees have grown for thousands of years, oils were once extracted with hot water, applied after the fruit has been picked and crushed, a process that damaged some of the phenols. In the modern era, manufacturing protocols were revised as it became clear that a way to economically extract the oil from the fruit while keeping the phenols intact was by spinning it in centrifuges using ambient temperatures (and no chemical solvents, as was sometimes used). Oils processed this way bear the \u201cextra virgin\u201d label.<\/p>\n<p>Olives\u2019 most well-studied phenols, called secoiridoids, include their natural derivatives oleocanthal, oleacein, oleuropein aglycone, ligstroside, aglycone, and oleomissional. But it\u2019s likely the combination working synergistically is what really matters.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--below-paragraph InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\" data-bumper-index=\"2\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/1afa0e57-b359-4d73-aae0-b75d2eb05771\/h_21.00328242.jpg?w=2303.9999389648438&amp;h=1535.3999593257904\" alt=\"A grove of olive trees across a hilly landscape.\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">Due to drought, the 2022 olive harvest at the Finca Carlota plantation, which belongs to the Green Gold Olive Oil Company, was vastly reduced compared with previous years.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><span class=\"RichText Caption__Credit\" aria-label=\"Photograph By Alfredo Caliz\/Panos Pictures\/Redux\">PHOTOGRAPH BY ALFREDO CALIZ\/PANOS PICTURES\/REDUX<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<h2>A tasty and powerful medicine<\/h2>\n<p>In locations where the Mediterranean diet has long been a staple, rates of many diseases are lower, and many experts think that the extra virgin olive oil is a big reason why.<\/p>\n<p><i>Heart disease<\/i>.

When asked if they would continue their given plan, many more in the oil group said yes. \u201cCompliance is the biggest issue with diet, so this is significant,\u201d says Flynn, the study\u2019s lead author.<\/p>\n<h2>It\u2019s more than the monounsaturated<b>\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dietaryguidelines.gov\/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials\/top-10-things-you-need-know\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Current federal dietary guidelines<\/a>\u00a0in the U.S. (as well as many other countries) fail to make a distinction between cooking oils aside from recommending eaters limit the saturated fats prevalent in red meat and palm oil that have been linked to ill health, Flynn laments.<\/p>\n<p>The polyunsaturated seed oils many cooks have turned to, however, including safflower, sunflower, corn, and soy, have problems of their own, she says. Most notably, they are subject to higher rates of chemical reactions\u2014known as oxidation\u2014that degrade their quality compared with extra virgin olive oil.<\/p>\n<p>And, as other monounsaturated cooking fats like canola oil do not pack the same health punch, attributing all the health benefits of extra virgin olive oil to its monounsaturated fats rather than its phenol content is wrong, Flynn says.<\/p>\n<p>Another misconception is that you can\u2019t cook well with extra virgin olive oil because the oil smokes at a low temperature, but it actually\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/actascientific.com\/ASNH\/pdf\/ASNH-02-0083.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">produces fewer unhealthy byproducts<\/a>\u00a0when heated compared with other oils, researchers have found.<\/p>\n<h2>Choose your olive oil carefully<\/h2>\n<p>Health isn\u2019t the only reason to boost your olive oil consumption. High quality, well stored olive oil also tastes great.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe call olive oil liquid gold\u201d because of its flavor and versatility along with its healthfulness, says Joy Pierson, a chef and restauranter who, with her husband Bart Potenza, founded the famous vegan Candle 79 restaurant and others in New York City and now serves as a mentor to other chefs specializing in vegan cuisine.<\/p>\n<p>The couple use extra virgin olive oil for seasoning and cooking everything from dressings, marinades, and pestos to saut\u00e9s, pan fries, roasted and grilled vegetables, and even cakes.<\/p>\n<p>Many people grab whatever extra virgin olive oil they find in their local supermarket but that is a mistake, Pierson says. The oils have unique flavors depending on the company, the growing region\u2019s climate and soil, and numerous other parameters, which are especially important when the oil is not cooked. She also prefers organic varieties.<\/p>\n<p>Pierson recommends going to a local farmers\u2019 market or gourmet shop where they let you taste various brands. She also suggests buying more than one, with a mild-flavored product for stir fries or cakes and one with more bite for a food like polenta.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf we cared about olive oil the way we care about wine, we might shop for them similarly,\u201d Wang says.<\/p>\n<p>Potenza recommends perusing the websites of extra virgin olive oil producers before settling on preferred brands. \u201cThey\u2019ll use descriptors like mild or grassy notes, similar to discussions of the flavor profiles of fine wines. It\u2019s exciting,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>Another important fact you can find on many websites is how quickly their olives go from plucking to oil production, something experts say should happen within hours to keep products fresh and phenols high. California, which has been producing extra virgin olive oil at scale only for a few decades, uses a modern method where special dwarf trees are planted close together to allow for speedy machine harvesting.<\/p>\n<p>But high-quality boutique oil companies that pick by hand also aim for that timetable, says Kiara Koutoulakis, the communication and sales manager at olive oil manufacturer\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/koronekes.gr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Koronekes<\/a>\u00a0on the Greek Island of Crete. \u201cThe fresher they are, the better,\u201d she says. \u201cOlives are a very fragile fruit.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Koronekes also picks its olives early in the harvest, before they turn black, when their phenols have been shown to be at their highest, she says.<\/p>\n<p>Because the large manufacturers extract the oil via centrifuge, you won\u2019t see the term \u201cfirst cold press\u201d on major brands. But small companies like Koronekes that still press their olives use that language to distinguish the initial, most flavorful batch.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--below-paragraph InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\" data-bumper-index=\"7\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/8553a5ea-b731-4887-89ce-05b449a1f291\/NationalGeographic_1939340.jpg?w=2303.9999389648438&amp;h=1535.3999593257904\" alt=\"A man stands on top of an olive oil tree in a grove bending a branch.\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">A farmer on the island of Crete prunes his olive trees in the spring to boost upcoming harvests. \u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><span class=\"RichText Caption__Credit\" aria-label=\"Photograph By MATTHIEU PALEY, Nat Geo Image Collection\">PHOTOGRAPH BY MATTHIEU PALEY, NAT GEO IMAGE COLLECTION<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<h2>How to store your extra virgin olive oil<\/h2>\n<p>Once you bring the bottle home, the clock is ticking.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI always say extra virgin olive oil loses its extra virginity with time,\u201d Wang says.
