Getting a visa for Sudan is an expensive hit-and-miss affair, but if you do manage to get in, and you stick to the safe areas, you will probably have a memorable experience. The Sudanese people are very hospitable, and you can visit some awesome tourist attractions without even seeing another tourist.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Capital<\/strong>.

When the colonial map-makers divided up Africa, they included in Sudan the predominantly Muslim people of the north (including Nubians), who share much of their history and culture with Egyptians and Arabs, and the largely Christian and Animist Nilotic and Bantu people of the south, who have more in common with the rest of sub-Saharan Africa than with their northern neighbours.<br \/>\nAfter decades of civil war and a transitional period of self rule, South Sudan became independent on 9 July 2011. Conflicts still linger in the western region of Darfur. From 1989 until his deposition by the military in 2019, Sudan was under the totalitarian rule of Omar Hassan Al-Bashir.<br \/>\nSudan is as geographically diverse as it is culturally; in the north, the Nile cuts through the eastern edge of the Sahara: the Nubian desert, the sites of the ancient kingdoms of Kush and Meroe, and the land of the Seti. Here, agriculture drives the economy. Staple crops include ful (fava beans), dates, tomato, and onion. The East and West are mountainous regions, and much of the rest of the country comprises savannahs typical of much of central sub-Saharan Africa.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GET IN<br \/>\nVisa.<\/strong> Sudanese travel visas are expensive and difficult to acquire for some nationalities in some countries and impossible for people with an Israeli stamp in their passport. It is advisable to obtain a Sudanese visa in your home country. You will need a letter of invitation from the hotel that you choose (they are used to providing this service, and may add a small charge for it). Alcohol is forbidden in Sudan, and attempting to import might result in severe penalties. For a quick Sudan visa in Cairo, the embassy is closed on Fridays.<br \/>\nCairo is one of the easiest places to get one (usually a couple of hours after application). You will almost definitely need a letter of invitation\/introduction from your embassy, and the time this takes varies from embassy to embassy. For most foreign nationalities visa fee in Cairo is now 150USD bit you only need to bring a pen and your passport. 2 copies of your passport and one of your Egyptian visa will safe you some money and trouble. You get the visa form for free at the counter. The whole procedure starts around 10am, but being there from 9am i a good idea. They do all visas in a day, sometimes the process is finished at 1pm, sometimes up to 3 or 4pm.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Canadian Embassy\u00a0does not issue letters, but the Sudanese embassy in Cairo will give visas to Canadians without the letter. This will present problems within Sudan when trying to obtain permits or renew visas, as these can only be obtained with a letter from the Canadian embassy in Khartoum which the embassy will not at this time provide.<br \/>\nIt is also possible to obtain a visa in Aswan.<br \/>\nFrom Ethiopia. Getting a visa from the Sudanese Embassy in Addis Ababa is extremely unpredictable, although it is cheaper (around USD60).<br \/>\nFrom Kenya. Visa applications are submitted between 10am and 12pm and visa collected next day between 3pm and 3.30pm. Cost is 5000 Kenyan Shillings (US$50). Letter of support for application can be obtained from own embassy<br \/>\n<strong>Permits and other legal requirements. <\/strong>All foreigners are required to register within three days of arrival, need two passport photos and photocopies of your passport.<br \/>\nTo\u00a0register\u00a0in Khartoum, go to the\u00a0Aliens Registration Bureau\u00a0at Shari\u2019a Al Sahafa Zat, Khartoum, close to Sudan University for Science and Technology, with passport sized photos required and SDG500 (July 2016 \u2013 USD not accepted). Expect to wait at least two to three hours. Most hotels can register you upon payment of a commission.<br \/>\n<strong>By plane. <\/strong>Khartoum Airport (KRT)\u00a0and\u00a0Port Sudan\u00a0Airport.<br \/>\nTurkish Airlines\u2019 Istanbul-Khartoum route, there are no direct flights operating from Europe.

As with the bus above, it leaves between 0430 and 0730 from the Aswan bus station.<br \/>\n<strong>By boat. <\/strong>The most reliable way to enter Sudan from Egypt is via the weekly ferry from\u00a0Aswan\u00a0in\u00a0Egypt\u00a0to\u00a0Wadi Halfa. Mondays to Sudan and back on Wednesdays. The best place to sleep is on deck amongst the cargo, magnificent views (including that of Abu Simbel). Food and drink are available on-board.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GET AROUND<br \/>\n<\/strong>Permits and other legal requirements. Independent travellers in Sudan with their own vehicles, or using public transport require a combined\u00a0Photography and Travel Permit\u00a0to travel to some areas outside Khartoum, but appears to be unnecessary at least North of Khartoum.<br \/>\nPersonal vehicles require a separate permit which is issued at land borders and costs SDG150.<br \/>\n<strong>By plane. <\/strong>Small airports in\u00a0Wadi Halfa,\u00a0El Debba,\u00a0Dongola,\u00a0Port Sudan,\u00a0El Fasher,\u00a0Wad Madani,\u00a0Merowe\u00a0and\u00a0El Obeid, all served by Sudan Airways. Most flights operate from Khartoum. Be prepared for changing timetables and cancelled flights.<br \/>\nSudan Airways is notorious for its poor safety record and punctuality. It is advisable to avoid Sudan Airways and consider alternative transport.<br \/>\n<strong>By train.<\/strong> Between Khartoum and Port Sudan.<br \/>\n<strong>By car. <\/strong>Driving chaotic but not especially dangerous by African standards. In most of the country, a 4WD is essential; Sudan\u2019s main highway is sealed for much of the way but most of the roads in the country are dirt or sand tracks. Crossing into Sudan from Egypt via the ferry from Aswan to Wadi Halfa now has the benefit of the Chinese financed tarmac highway covering the 400km south to Dongola, and then right through to Khartoum, another 500km. This road is quick for overlanders as there are few military roadblocks, and very little other traffic.<br \/>\nHitchhiking is fairly common in Sudan though there are not many private vehicles outside of Khartoum<br \/>\n<strong>By bus. <\/strong>Khartoum to the major towns, departing from at least two chaotic depots. Noise cancelling headphones. In remoter areas people tend to use trucks or \u201cboxes\u201d.<br \/>\n<strong>Talk. <\/strong>The official languages in Sudan are\u00a0Arabic\u00a0and English. English is not widely spoken except by officials, students and hospitality workers. The older generations tends to speak the better English.<br \/>\n<strong>Money. <\/strong>Cash. Bring recently printed, clean and unmarked currency preferably US Dollars. British Pounds and to a lesser extent Euros. Traveller\u2019s cheques and non-Sudanese bank cards are not accepted. Money changers in Afra Mall.<br \/>\nBefore leaving Sudan, make sure to change any local<br \/>\n<strong>Eat.<\/strong> Foul, made from fava beans, is by far the most commonly eaten food in Sudan, often a sandwich filling.

Completely alcohol-free. karkade\u00a0or hibiscus can be served hot or chilled,\u00a0aradeeb\u00a0or tamarind, and\u00a0gongoleiz\u00a0, made with the baobab fruit.<br \/>\n<strong>Sleep. <\/strong>Most larger towns and cities have affordable hotels. Lower mid-range offer the worst value. Ceiling fan to keep things cool. The beds are usually out in the courtyard under the stars,<br \/>\nCamping in the wild is easy in rural areas outside the south as long as the usual precautions are taken.<br \/>\n<strong>Stay safe. <\/strong>More safe than most African countries and safe by Western standards. Walk everywhere. locals really want to help, beggars are rare and not aggressive.<br \/>\nArmed conflict. Sudan ended a 40-year civil war between the Khartoum based central government and non-Muslim separatist groups from the South. Relations between the two countries after the independence of\u00a0South Sudan\u00a0remain fluid and somewhat tense.<br \/>\nThe well-publicized conflict in Darfur is still taking place.<br \/>\nPolice and army. There will be no problem with police unless you have broken the law.<br \/>\n<strong>Health.<\/strong> Sudan is a\u00a0malarial\u00a0region especially cautious during the rainy season.<br \/>\n<strong>Respect.\u00a0<\/strong>Religious sensitivities. Sudan is Islamic with a form of Sharia law. Alcohol and drugs are forbidden. Sudanese women wear very conservative clothing. Men should wear long trousers, not shorts.<br \/>\nAny foreigner will be treated as a local, and dealt with accordingly, in many cases, given a jail sentence of several months and a whipping, the minimum being forty lashes<br \/>\nLocal customs. To show the bottom of your foot is an insulting gesture, as is the touching of the thumb to the index finger while extending the rest of the fingers (the North American sign for \u201cO-kay\u201d). Foreigners are discouraged from speaking directly to local women<br \/>\nConversation. Avoid asking direct questions about people\u2019s political opinions. Tact is a necessity after more than 40 years of civil war and refugees are spread around, especially Khartoum.NM Sudan<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Railway, Metro, Funiculars, Cable Cars: <\/em><\/strong>Sudan Intercity Railway Experience<br \/>\n<strong><em>Rivers<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Blue Nile<br \/>\nWhite Nile<br \/>\n<strong><em>Experiences: <\/em><\/strong>Sufi Holiya Festival<br \/>\n<strong><em>Borders<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Eritrea-Sudan<br \/>\nSudan (sea border\/port)<\/p>\n<p><strong>NOMAD MANIA Sudan \u2013 Khartoum and River Nile State (Ad Damir)<br \/>\n<em>M@P:\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>River Nile state north (Abu Hamad)<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><strong><em>World Heritage Sites: <\/em><\/strong>Archaeological Sites of the Island of Meroe<br \/>\n<strong><em>Religious Temples: <\/em><\/strong>Omdurman: Masjid Al-Nilin<br \/>\n<strong><em>World of Nature: <\/em><\/strong>Sabaloka Game Reserve<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>African Cities<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong><strong>ATBARAH<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>DAMIR<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>KHARTOUM\/OMDURMAN <\/strong>World Capitals World Cities and Popular Towns<br \/>\n<strong><em>Airports: <\/em><\/strong>Khartoum (KRT)<br \/>\n<strong><em>Museums<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Ethnographic Museum<br \/>\nNational Museum of Sudan<br \/>\n<strong><em>Religious Temples<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Greek Orthodox Cathedral<br \/>\nKhartoum Grand Mosque<br \/>\nSaints Peter and Paul Catholic Church<br \/>\n<strong><em>Modern Architecture Buildings: <\/em><\/strong>Corinthia Hotel<br \/>\n<strong><em>Markets: <\/em><\/strong>Omdurman Souq<\/p>\n<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br \/>\n<strong>NOMAD MANIA Sudan \u2013 Northern State (Merowe, Karima)<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong><em>M@P:<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0\u00a0Libya\/Egypt\/Sudan &#8211;
