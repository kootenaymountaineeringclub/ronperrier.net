Virtually every road has bike lanes on both sides (usually in red brick or pavement). I am surprised that virtually no one wears a helmet, several rides with headphones (very dangerous), almost all bikes have panniers, a wicker basket, a baby carrier or pull a baby cart, and the vast majority are clunky-looking, upright handlebar street bikes. The lanes keep them out of the traffic, not like the suicide riders in the UK.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Food.<\/strong> Some unusual things are no fresh milk, only UHT; beef hamburger is not common and then finely ground with no fat, not very good for hamburgers \u2013 a beef\/pork combination is much more common. Carrefour is ridiculously expensive but, like the UK and Ireland, there are Aldi and Lidl stores that offer good savings.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Gas.<\/strong> The cheapest is about \u20ac1.35\/l, diesel is less than gas, but there are no tolls, so it ends up being a little less than in the UK. Prices vary widely.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>English.<\/strong> Everyone speaks good English.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>WESTERN FLANDERS<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">This area suffered greatly during WW I, but most were rebuilt with great style, especially Ypres and Diksmuide. Bruges and Ghent have wonderful medieval centres and are the true highlight of the area. The extensive sandy beaches provide relief from the sombre sight of battlefields.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>I drove east along the coast, visited Bruges in one day, continued SE to Ghent and the drove SW to visit the Ypres area.<\/em> <em>June 27 was a sunny day with a high of 20, but it felt much colder with the stiff north wind blowing off the cold English Channel.<\/em> <em>It is much warmer inland.<br \/>\n<\/em><strong>Beaches.<\/strong> The beaches on the Atlantic coast are all gorgeous \u2013 hard-packed sand next to the water and sugary soft, beige stuff at the back. They must all be busy in the summer with all the hotels, restaurants, and apartments that back the promenades. But the English Channel misses most of the Gulf Stream and the water is relatively cold.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">However, the back of all the beaches is lined with white, 8\u2019 square sheds, slightly smaller than those in England, and to my mind, quite ugly. I asked at one of the beaches what they were for \u2013 they are simple storage sheds that people use to store their stuff when they are sunbathing. Go figure. They are usually rented for the entire April \u2013 September summer season and aren\u2019t available for one day at a time, few are available for a week (cost depends on the month) and some are rented by the month. The cost for this 5-month season depends on the town: \u20ac765 at De Hann and closer to \u20ac1,000 for the bigger beaches a little north. Nobody sleeps in the sheds (although it looked like they were more beach houses in England).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Windbreaks of fabric strung between thin posts divide up the beaches. They are necessary for comfort as the common north wind is very cold (west winds just about always bring rain). Rental costs for other items\/day: umbrella \u20ac5, simple cloth chair \u20ac5, reclining lounge chair \u20ac7. These windbreaks divide the beach among all the private providers who \u201cown\u201d their strip. Each section has its own colour and beach bar located in one of the sheds.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Only a few kids were wading in the water and fewer yet walking the beach. Everyone else was baking in the lee of the windbreaks. And on this cool Wednesday, there were a lot of people.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Every beach town has a wide promenade above the beach. Up here were all the \u201coldies\u201d, bundled up in warm jackets. Statues are common on the promenades. Next come mostly apartments, some hotels, and several restaurants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>I drove east along the coast to visit all the following places.<br \/>\n<\/em><strong>Kusttram.<\/strong> Just across the border from France, this is in the NM \u201csmall town\u201d series, but I don\u2019t quite understand why. It is not on any map and is just an inland suburb of the city of <strong>Koksijde<\/strong>, one of the many resort towns that line the Belgian coast.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I decided to travel the local road next to the beach heading east. It is never that close to the beach and any views of the water are obscured by dunes.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A coastal tram, the Lijn, goes all the way from Knokke to De Panne\/Adinkerke.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>OSTEND<\/strong> (pop 69,000).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>History.<\/strong> As a fortified port, it was ravaged by a 4-year siege in 1600-04 as the last \u2018Belgian\u2019 city to refuse Spanish reconquest. Later it blossomed as one of Europe\u2019s most stylish seaside resorts. Most were bombed during WW II when German occupying forces (re)built the remarkable Atlantikwall sea defences that are today the city\u2019s best sight. After the war, it was rebuilt as a grid of unaesthetic blocks. Today it is mostly a domestic seaside resort. Marvin Gaye lived here in a self-imposed exile from 1981-3 in an attempt to dry out from his drugged lifestyle. Two years later, in a state of cocaine-fuelled paranoia in Los Angeles, he was shot by his father.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The wide sandy beach has an ample promenade backed by tearooms with glassed-in terraces. The ho-hum hotels serve for any spillover from nearby Bruges.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Thornton Bank is a vast wind turbine farm 30 km out in the English Channel. Boat trips to see the farm are available.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Mercator.<\/strong> This fully rigged, three-masted 1932 sailing ship was originally used for Belgian navy training purposes and since 1962 sits on an inland lake in central Ostend. It was renovated and reopened in 2017 as a nautical museum with rotating exhibits. The present exhibit was on a Belgian sailor captured by the Italians on Corsica in 1943, tortured and killed. Arctic traveller Adrien de Gerlache designed it and it was built in Scotland. It made 54 voyages. In 1956, it repatriated the remains of Father Damian from Molokai Hawaii. In 1960 it arrived in Antwerp and the next year was equipped as a museum ship becoming the pearl in Ostend&#8217;s crown.<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"slideshow\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.visitoostende.be\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/slideshow\/public\/kopie_van_mercator_003.jpg?itok=Hlhdh0fz\" alt=\"\" \/><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Mu Zee.<\/strong> Ostend\u2019s premier gallery, the third floor has local artists, the second rotating contemporary art ( on the architecture of images in the interwar period &#8211; not too interesting) and the ground floor an exhibit of James Ensor (1860-1945) who lived in Ostend for 40 years.

It is best at night with fabulous evening floodlighting and tries to come mid-week.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>History.<\/strong> A fortress was originally constructed at the head of a long sea channel called the Zwin. Its medieval prosperity came from trading and manufacturing textiles from high-quality English wool. 13th-century\u00a0traders were the first to formalize stock trading and to this day, stock exchanges are still called bourses in many languages and by 1301, Bruges citizens were very wealthy. Its zenith came in the 14<sup>th<\/sup> century when the Hanseatic League (a powerful association of northern European trading cities) set up international trading houses and ships laden with exotic goods from all over Europe and beyond docked at the Minnewater. In 1332, Venice merchants established a permanent office for luxury goods. Prosperity continued under the Dukes of Burgundy and at one point the population ballooned to 200,000, double that of London. Flemish art blossomed the city\u2019s artists, known at the Flemish Primitives perfected painting that was anything but primitive.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A dynastic conflict between the French and Hapsburg empires in 1482 caused rising taxes and restrictions of the guildsmen\u2019s privileges that sparked a decade of disastrous revolts. The townsmen imprisoned the Hapsburg heir, Maximilian of Austria for 4 months, the Hapsburgs took furious retributions and Bruges was forced to demolish the city walls. The Hanseatic League moved to Antwerp and many merchants followed. But most devastating of all, the Zwin gradually silted up so Bruges lost all access to the sea. The city\u2019s economic lifeline was gone and the town was left full of abandoned houses, deserted streets, and empty canals. Bruges slept for 400 years.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The city slowly emerged in the early 19<sup>th<\/sup> century as war tourists passed through en route to the Waterloo battlefield. In 1892, Georges Rodenbach published <em>Bruges-la-Morte<\/em> (Bruges the Dead), a novel that beguilingly described the town\u2019s forlorn but preserved charm. Curious wealthy visitors came and ever since the town has worked hard at renovations and embellishments to maintain its reputation as one of the world\u2019s best-preserved medieval time capsules.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Antique Bruges escaped both world wars relatively unscathed and now largely lives off tourism. However, beyond the cute central area are industries making glass, electrical goods and chemicals, much of it exported via the 20th-century port of Zeebrugge, to which Bruges has been linked since 1907 by the Boudewijnkanaal (Baudouin Canal).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Old town Bruges is encased by an oval-shaped moat that follows the city\u2019s medieval fortifications. The walls are gone, but four of the nine 14<sup>th<\/sup>-century gates still stand. The sights are all within easy walking distance as the centre is so compact.

The potato museum follows the story from its origin 10,000 years ago as the wild Andean potato in Peru to now with 4000 varieties, the most of any plant. It came to the Canary Islands in 1516 and spread through Spain and France arriving in Belgium in 1567. Belgium consumes the most of any country at 300kg-person\/year and is #1 in eating them fried. The potato produces 16 tons\/hectare whereas rice is only 3.8 tons\/hectare. The biggest potato weighed 4.99kg and the longest was 26cm. Served alone they are not fattening as they are 80% water and 0% fat. In WW I, French-speaking Belgian soldiers offered chips to American soldiers and that is how they became known as French fries.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">They are best cooked in their jackets to minimize loss of nutrients and are best fried in 2 stages: first at 140\u00b0C for 4-8 minutes to form a crust, shake to remove oil and let them rest, and then at 170\u00b0C for 2-3 minutes. The best oil is groundnut or sunflower oil.

But they have laid a cunning trap, the Flemish had previously disguised a boggy marsh with brushwood. Snared by the mud, the heavily armoured French were quickly immobilized and slaughtered, their golden spurs hacked off and displayed as trophies in Kortijk\u2019s church.

The area&#8217;s line of barely visible undulations provided enough extra elevation to make good vantage points and were prized military objectives. Hundreds of lives were lost in numerous bids to take these very modest ridges. The first battle of Ypres in October and November 1914 set the lines of the Salient. After that, both sides dug in and gained relatively little around for the remainder of the war, despite three valiantly suicidal battles that followed. The most infamous of these came in the spring of 1915 when Germans around Langemark launched WWI\u2019s first poison gas attack. It had devastating effects on the advancing Allied soldiers and on the Germans themselves. On 31 July 1917, British forces launched a three-month offensive commonly remembered as the Battle of Passendale, the \u2018battle of the mud\u2019. Fought in shocking weather on fields already liquidized by endless shelling, this horrifically futile episode killed or wounded over half a million men, all for a few kilometres of ground. These modest Allied gains were lost again in April 1918.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Flanders\u2019s WW I battlefields suffered four years of senseless fighting during which 850,00 Allied soldiers lost their lives.

The reconstruction of villages and replanting of trees took years, and even now farmers regularly plow up unexploded munitions.

Initially, there were wooden blocks with a bronze plaque that were replaced by the current granite grave markers each commemorating 20 soldiers. Vladslo, amid oak trees, is best known for the two statues <em>Grieving Parents<\/em> created by Kathie Kollwitze whose son Peter is buried at the foot of the father\u2019s statue. They are universal symbols for every parent who has lost a child to the tragedy of war and are renowned for their simplicity: the father is kneeling with hunched shoulders but his head is erect and the mother is kneeling but head bowed. Both have their arms crossed in front.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When I was here, in contrast to the Allied cemeteries, there were no other visitors.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Tyne Cot.<\/strong> Near Passendale, this is probably the most visited Saliente site, the world\u2019s biggest British Commonwealth war cemetery with 11.956 graves. A huge semicircular wall commemorates 34,857 lost-in-action soldiers from the UK and New Zealand whose names wouldn\u2019t fit on Ypres\u2019 Menin Gate (which has the Canadian entries). Oddly there is one from the Royal Newfoundland Regiment \u2013 Second Lieutenant Barrett. Two dumpy concrete bunkers sit amongst the graves and the large central 1927 Cross of Sacrifice.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It was decided to not repatriate those who fought together should remain united in death. The dead remained where they fell, many were lost in the mud and then were taken to a large concentration cemetery. In 1919-21, they were reburied with a wooden cross eventually replaced by a headstone made of Portland cement. The cemetery seen today was completed in 1927.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Each grave has the regiment badge if from the UK, a maple leaf if Canadian, a harp if Irish, a springbok if South African, a fern if from NZ or a setting sun if Australian. If the body is unidentified, there is the inscription \u201cA Soldier of the Great War\u201d and \u201cKnown Unto God\u201d. Religion is marked with a cross if Christian, Star of David if Jewish and none if religion is unspecified or Presbyterian Church of Scotland. There are rows of 6 different kinds of roses and in front of each grave are five types of flowers. The four gardeners in charge of this cemetery and the interns are all employees of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I had a great tour of the cemetery from an intern from north England. She showed me some of the more interesting graves. Arthur Conway Young \u2013 Royal Irish Fusiliers 16\/08\/17 Born in Kobe Japan, has no religious sign and the inscription \u201cSacrificed to the Fallacy That War Can End War\u201d so is presumed to have been a conscientious objector. J P Robertson VC 6\/11\/1917 was known as \u2018Whistling Pete\u201d, at 35 still a private as he had refused promotion. \u201cBehold How Good and How Pleasant it is For Brethren to Dwell Together in Unity (Mother)\u201d. There was also a Canadian Victoria Cross recipient.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><em>SE of Ypres<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong><strong>Canadian Hill 62 Memorial<\/strong>.

It is significant for the memorial to the Canadian Medical Doctor, Lt Colonel <strong>John McCrae<\/strong> (1872-1918) who wrote <em>In Flanders Fields<\/em> when stationed here as the medical officer for 17 days during the gas attack of April 22, 1915. Initially, the medical station was simply dug into the canal bank and then was replaced in September 1916 with the concrete bunker seen today. McCrae died in 1918 from pneumonia (I presume influenza) while serving at a Canadian Army hospital in Boulogne-Sur-Mer, south of Calais and that is where his grave is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>YPRES<\/strong> (IEPER pop 36,000)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">in the Middle Ages, it was an important cloth town, ranking alongside Bruges and Ghent. In WWI some 300,000 Allied soldiers died in the \u2018Salient\u201d, a bow-shaped bulge that formed the front line around town. Ypres remained unoccupied by German forces but was utterly flattened by bombardment. After the war, the medieval core was convincingly rebuilt.
