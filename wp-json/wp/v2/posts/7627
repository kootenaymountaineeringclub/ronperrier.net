Just after crossing a stream, at the height of the road, a branch goes up and left to Sunset Lake and\u00a0 Pontiac Peak 1296m (4250&#8242;). This is the trailhead as this road was washed out in 1998 and can&#8217;t be driven. Descend steeply on the narrow, overgrown and eroded road. Takes 20 minutes to walk so can park here.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> 13.4km Park 1341m (4400&#8242;).

It leads west from the BC Parks kiosk, is level and usually rather wet and thick with annual growth, especially in the early morning.\u00a0Soon cross a bridge to the north side of Woodbury Creek.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">1.6 km. Bear left for Woodbury Cabin. Right leads NW to Silver Spray and the cabin. Once this poor section is negotiated, the hike up the valley is a pleasant one.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Woodbury Creek basin nestles in the eastern flank of the rugged Sawtooth Ridge while the Woodbury Glacier sprawls down the side of Glacier View Peak to the south. Just below is Wolf Cascade, where Woodbury Creek drops suddenly and dramatically on its way to the forested valley below.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">From the basin, the trail climbs up the hillside in a series of switchbacks to reach the Woodbury Hut. A cabin built partly of natural rock and partly of timber, accommodation is available for 6-8 people. Please observe the posted cabin rules and enjoy the best view from the outhouse. Compared to the beautiful Silver Spray Cabin, the Woodbury cabin is darker, older, much smaller and has a more spartan attitude.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">An old unmaintained trail climbs steeply up the basin behind the cabin to some old mine workings and a tarn perched on a bench at 2341m (7680&#8242;). Worth the effort for the views west and south.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>What to do?<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">1. Climb any of the many mountains around the cabin: <strong>Moonlight Peak, Mt Kemball, or Artist Point <\/strong>behind the cabin.<strong> Sawtooth Ridge<\/strong> to the west is rugged with confusing ridge lines.
