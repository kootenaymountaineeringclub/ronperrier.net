Kids medicated with Ritalin or other psychoactive drugs alter their brain chemistry in such a way that they can adapt to the rules that society imposes on them. However, this doesn\u2019t solve the problem of finding a match between their unique brains and a favourable niche. The traditional classroom is one of the worst possible places for a child with an ADHD brain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Origins of ADHD<br \/>\n<\/strong>In the mid-1970s, these kids were regarded as suffering from \u201chyperactivity\u201d, \u201chyperkinesis,\u201d or \u201cminimal brain dysfunction\u201d. ADD or attention deficit disorder was first described in 1970, but it was not until the late 1980s that ADHD became a widely known disorder and children with ADHD were being placed in special education programs.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The current consensus is that ADHD affects 3-5% of all children and that 60% will continue to have the disorder into adulthood.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">ADHD is characterized by three key groups of symptoms: Hyperactivity (e.g. being fidgety or restless), impulsivity (e.g. interrupting or grabbing things from others) and distractibility (e.g forgetting things or having difficulty organizing life tasks). Three different forms of ADHD are recognized: one that is primarily \u201cinattentive\u201d involving distractibility (this is often referred to as ADD, one that is primarily \u201chyperactive\u201d and \u201cimpulsive\u201d (de-emphasizing distractibility), and one that includes all three groups of symptoms.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Although there are far more males diagnosed with ADHD than females, the primarily inattentive type has been increasingly observed in girls.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The primary treatments are adaptive and include the use of medications, especially psychostimulants like Ritalin and Adderall, and behaviour modification programs in the home and at school.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The nature and connections in the brain appear to be disrupted in the circuitry between the restraint and planning areas of the brain (the prefrontal lobes) and the emotional and motor areas (the basal ganglia and the cerebellum). The restraint areas do not keep the emotional and motor areas in check, resulting in hyperactivity and impulsivity. Problems with executive functions of the prefrontal lobes appear to result in difficulty with planning, organization, and focused attention, resulting in distractibility. The actual volume of these three brain areas is 3-4% smaller in kids diagnosed with ADHD than matched controls.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>ADHD: An Evolutionary Leap for Humanity?<br \/>\n<\/strong>Children labelled ADHD undergo normal patterns of brain growth, but they lag behind normal children by an average of three years. They attain peak thickness in half the sites that integrate the sensory-motor areas that integrate planning, problem solving and inhibitory areas at an average age of ten and a half years old, whereas matched controls matured at seven and a half. The rate of ADHD in any given age group declines by 50% every five years.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">They are thus best described as late bloomers and not kids with defective brains. They simply act younger than their peers and need more time to mature. Rather than this immaturity being a negative thing, this kind of youthful behaviour in someone chronologically older may be an evolutionary step forward in our species.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The concept of neoteny (Latin for \u201cholding youth\u201d) refers to the retention of childlike qualities into later development. Einstein\u2019s fame as the absent-minded professor would likely have qualified him for the \u201cdistractible\u201d variety of ADHD. Many of civilization\u2019s most celebrated individuals were in some ways like children in adult bodies, including Picasso, Mozart and Shakespeare (whose childish puns and insults offended the serious critics of his day).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Neoteny may be a progressive feature of evolution: the more evolved a species is, the more likely there are to be childlike features held into adulthood. Some of these behavioural qualities include curiosity, playfulness, wonder, creativity, flexibility, inventiveness, and humour. They disappear in others who\u2019ve tended to become rigid over the years.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">These patterns need to be retained into adulthood if we\u2019re going to continue to survive and thrive as a species. If we lose the ability to be flexible as we grow into adulthood, we\u2019d have a civilization of inflexible people, which could be disastrous in the event of a global showdown that threatened us, for example, a nuclear war. It may provide a kind of protective influence for international stability. Childish qualities constitute the most valuable possessions of our species, to be cherished, nurtured, and cultivated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Creating \u201cGood Chemistry\u201d in the ADHD Brain<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Many brain chemicals are involved, but dopamine, associated with, among other things, motor activity, motivation, and reward seeking, is particularly important. People with ADHD appear to have lower levels of dopamine in their brains, thus causing a constant hunger for stimulation. This helps explain their need for constant motor activity, impulsivity, and thrill seeking. The traditional classroom or office cubicle is not enough to satisfy their starved dopaminergic brain pathways. Contrary to what many people believe, people with ADHD are actually unstimulated. What stimulates the average person is not enough for them. They need a higher dose of thrills and chills. This is why psychostimulants are so very often effective. By increasing the levels of dopamine in the brain, the higher level of stimulation paradoxically calms them down.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">These problems of dopamine regulation appear to have a genetic basis. ADHD is one of the most easily inherited of all psychiatric disorders, present in 25% of the close relatives who have the disorder compared to 5% of the general population. An identical twin has a 75-91% chance that the other twin will also have it. One variant of one allele of a gene that is involved in the production of dopamine receptors (called the Dopamine D4 Gene 7-repeat allele, or DRD4 for short) is more prevalent among ADHD children. It has been called the \u201cnovelty-seeking gene and is also more prevalent in individuals who enjoy activities such as bungee jumping, skydiving, and other high-intensity thrills.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Besides its association with risky behaviours, it has furthered human evolution. DRD4 arose comparatively recently in human evolution, between 10 and 40,000 years ago as an unusual spontaneous mutation, which became an advantage for humans. Novelty seeking was particularly important when the earliest forms of culture and civilization were being created. Those individuals might have been more likely to explore new territory, discover new food sources, or create new forms of social organization, and thus might have been in a better position to survive and pass their genes on to future generations than those without the allele.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>The Gifts of ADHD in Other Times and Places<br \/>\n<\/strong>Hyperactivity, distractibility, and impulsivity have numerous potential advantages for coping with difficulties during prehistoric times. Hyperactive people do a better job at foraging for food, seeking shelter, and engaging in other important survival tasks. Distractibility makes a person constantly vigilant to possible threats to his safety and the safety of his family and tribe. The capacity to respond quickly to one\u2019s instincts (impulsivity) is vital to quick action, such as meeting dangers from other humans or animals in their immediate area. They were hunters in a farmer\u2019s world. The hunter is always moving, always vigilant, always tuned into his instincts while seeking food and shelter and trying to avoid becoming prey. The farmer plants seeds in the ground and waits. Patience is required. Instead of living in the present, the farmer needs to think about the future and plan. Hunting and farming represent two distinct energy styles that persist in our contemporary world.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Many cultures view ADHD symptoms as positive traits. The Puluwat culture in the South Pacific lives on 500 different islands, so the ability to navigate has high cultural value. Children memorize the constellations to use for navigation, they recognize little bumps on the horizon, and they identify light and dark patches in the water to show coral reefs. In this culture, multitasking, always moving, and constantly shifting perceptions are traits of the gifted children.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Different cultures require different abilities and have different expectations of behaviour. Whether you are labelled as gifted or disabled has more to do with when and where you were born than anything intrinsic to you as an individual.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Even in our complex modern society, traits of ADHD confer distinct advantages. The traits for creative people are indistinguishable, but labelled differently \u2013 impulsive vs spontaneity, distractible vs a divergent mind (thinking outside the box by following their ideas, images or instincts wherever they might lead), hyperactive vs vitality (constantly on the prowl for the answer to a creative problem).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The disadvantage of the term ADHD speaks of an attention deficit. Children (and adults) labelled ADHD are very good at paying attention \u2013 they excel in paying attention to what they\u2019re not supposed to be paying attention to \u2013 this is called \u201cincidental attention\u201d and is another trait of the creative person. They see things that other people miss \u2013 a peach has colour, texture and grows in a field; books on marine life make them imagine life beneath the sea.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">People with ADHD are also very good at paying attention to what interests them. They can spend hours building with Lego, dancing, playing video games, or engaging in other absorbing tasks. This may be called \u201chyperfocus\u201d, another warning sign of ADHD, rather than the trait of an exceptional mind able to concentrate on a single task. The term \u201cflow\u201d describes highly proficient individuals like rock climbers or surgeons engaged in a 12-hour operation.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Their \u201croaming\u201d attention can notice many different things in a short period, and a \u201choming\u201d attention that can fasten onto one thing for some time. They are good at two different forms of attention, but have problems with one kind referred to as \u201ccentral-task\u201d attention that requires sustained attention at routine and often boring events that have been externally imposed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Nice Construction for ADHD Kids: Keep it Stimulating<br \/>\n<\/strong>Find the microhabitats and construct niches that provide more time in favourable environments. The brains of children with ADHD are under stimulated, including a boring classroom. Construct classrooms with music, colour, movement and interaction (educational Ritalin). Provide two desks so that whenever he gets up, he has another desk to move to. Provide a special lectern so that class work can be done sitting or standing. Install a pedal at the base to keep his feet in motion. Use large, bouncy therapy balls instead of chairs.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Special education classes are among the more boring, so homeschooling may be the answer. Positive niches give more freedom.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Even in children as young as five, show a significant reduction in ADHD symptoms when engaged with nature. The more natural and \u201cwilderness-like\u201d the setting, the more the children\u2019s behaviour improved. When you have to struggle to maintain attention, like a task like writing or doing computations, neurotransmitters in the brain\u2019s prefrontal cortex get depleted and \u201cattention fatigue\u201d occurs. Being in nature seems to replenish neurotransmitters. As ADHD people are already chronically dopamine-depleted, it is recommended to give ADHD kids \u201cgreen time\u201d before any activity that requires attention.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Rough and tumble play is another important niche activity. It requires adequate spaces and opportunities to express the natural biological need for vigorous free-play, each and every day. Unfortunately, the cultural trend is toward a more sedentary childhood, where children sit passively watching television, \u201cplaying\u201d video games, working at their computers and being involved in adult-supervised competitive games (also not true play). The solutions are: more recess time at school and more time at home to build forts, play wrestle, do cartwheels and somersaults, and engage in more child-centred informal physical games like sandlot baseball or football.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Niche Construction for Adults: Use Your Dynamic Brain<br \/>\n<\/strong>Physical movement, change, novelty, high stimulation, and hands-on activity are all factors in good niche construction. Most of these elements are found in firefighting and EMT work that provides an intense, fast-paced world and is tailor-made for someone who craves constant change and adrenaline-producing situations. Creativity, risk-taking and quick decision-making are all required.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Business and entrepreneurship are also good matches. Being able to distill complex facts and come up with simple solutions, the ADHD brain naturally searches for better ways of doing things. With a tendency to wander, spending less time in an office for an executive and moving from store to store, noticing what people were doing right and discovering many wonderful ideas to help expand the business. ADD people are high energy and extremely good brainstormers. They will happily work 12-15 hours by choice.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Potentially good careers for ADHD: disc jockey or radio announcer, traveling salesperson, music or dance therapist, choreographer or dancer, aerobic or fitness instructor, forest ranger, recreational worker, itinerant teacher, radio, television or newspaper reporter, freelance writer, artist of editor, police officer or firefighter, private detective, nature photographer, building contractor, craftsperson, artist or sculptor, inventor or designer, community ombudsman, truck, bus or taxicab driver, airline pilot, ship captain or train engineer, emergency room physician, freelance researcher, farmer or ranch worker, athlete or coach, lecturer or workshop leader, surveyor or cartographer, fashion model public relations consultant.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Each of these careers has at least one element that favours ADHD abilities: out in nature, traveling around or moving frequently, working with one\u2019s hands, being actively involved with new situations from day to day, handling emergencies, being physically engaged, doing many different things in a short period, engaging in creative pursuits such as the arts, and being able to work for oneself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In addition to career choice, new technologies can help build a comfortable niche: personal digital assistants to help organize and manage different aspects of one\u2019s hectic daily schedule. They can provide reminders for appointments, prioritizing commitments, communicating with others (email and cell phones), access the internet, navigating using GPS, organizing accounts and budgets, taking notes, (word processing, digital software, documenting events (camera, video recorder), providing stimulation and entertainment (computer games, radio, movies).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Human resources can help them prioritize, focus and get things done. It is best to surround themselves with individuals who are good at the specifics of a business \u2013 assistants who help write letters and keep their calendar. They don\u2019t get bogged down in the details but hire people to handle that. Trainers and personal coaches (via phone, email or in person) help with organization, time management, follow through, motivation, and discovering \u201cworkarounds\u201d for dealing with challenges. They can help to develop their ability to listen \u2013 don\u2019t talk until the other person has completed their sentence, and recap with them to make sure you understand what they said. Write reminders to do these things at the top of their notepad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Medication<br \/>\n<\/strong>For some, medications can provide an important \u201dplatform\u201d on which a positive niche can be created. But especially with children, medications should be viewed with caution. Ritalin and other psychostimulants have rare serious side effects and have a potential for abuse (adolescents use them as a street drug). They may tend to attribute their improved behaviour to their \u201dgood pill\u201d rather than their effort. There\u2019s a danger in using medications to provide chemical stimulation as a substitute for good living. It\u2019s important to provide children, who are just starting out on life\u2019s journey, with a strong developmental foundation of play, sensory-rich experiences, and dynamically interactive environments. If problems continue after the healthy lifestyle has been instituted for some time, the psychoactive medication becomes more appropriate. People with ADHD may discover that their greatest improvements in mental health come about not so much through drugs but through changing the ecology of their outer surroundings to match the brisk and ebullient nature of their joyful hyperactive brains.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">=============================================================<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>ADHD and FEMALES<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"VZTD UeCOM jIRH oimqG DjbQm UwdmX Xmrlz ReShI KaJdY lqtkC ssImf HfYhe RTHNs \" data-testid=\"prism-GridContainer\">\n<div class=\"Kiog kNVGM nvpSA qwdi bmjsw \" data-testid=\"prism-GridRow\">\n<div class=\"theme-e oBTii mrzah \" data-testid=\"prism-GridColumn\">\n<div class=\"dHdHP jLREf zXXje aGO eCClZ nTLv jLsYA gmuro TOSFd VmeZt sCkVm hkQai wGrlE MUuGM fciaN qQjt DhNVo Tgcqk IGLAf tWjkv \">\n<div class=\"InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW \" data-testid=\"prism-inline-image\">\n<figure class=\"kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO \" data-testid=\"prism-figure\">\n<div class=\"GpQCA lZur \" data-testid=\"prism-ratio-frame\">\n<div class=\"FvQLF iLTd NqeUA UzzHi iWsMV \"><\/div>\n<\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur \" data-testid=\"prism-caption\">\n<div class=\"HXPPJ barbu IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul \"><span class=\"hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz \" style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\" data-testid=\"prism-truncate\"><span class=\"gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ \">ADHD diagnoses are climbing among adult women and have nearly doubled since 2020.

Experts call this masking, or how people socialized as females tend to find ways to compensate for their symptoms due to societal expectations. \u201cThey have to put in at least twice the effort of other people if they\u2019re determined to do well,\u201d Nadeau says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cYou can\u2019t let people know that you\u2019re falling apart,\u201d says Janna Moen, 31, a postdoctoral research scientist at Yale Center for Infection and Immunity with a PhD in neuroscience, who was diagnosed with ADHD in her late 20s. Like many girls who go untreated, Moen scored top grades in school and went on to have a successful career, but years of masking her symptoms contributed to her developing mental health and self-esteem issues and struggling in personal relationships.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Like Moen, who showed symptoms of ADHD from childhood, girls and women are more likely to have their symptoms mistaken for emotional or learning difficulties and are less likely to be referred for assessments. Gender bias also may play a role: in\u00a0two studies\u00a0where teachers were presented with vignettes of children with ADHD, when the child\u2019s names and pronouns were changed from female to male, they were more likely to be recommended for treatment and offered extra support.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">All these misconceptions mean that girls with ADHD are being overlooked and untreated well into adulthood. As David Goodman, the director of the Adult Attention Deficit Disorder Center of Maryland and an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, points out,\u00a0the ratio of boys to girls with ADHD in childhood is about three to one, while in adults, it\u2019s about one to one, suggesting that ADHD prevalence is more equal across genders, with women being diagnosed later.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"FITT_Article_main_group_wrapper VZTD UeCOM jIRH oimqG DjbQm UwdmX Xmrlz ReShI KaJdY lqtkC ssImf HfYhe RTHNs iJVrZ \" data-testid=\"prism-GridContainer\">\n<div class=\"Kiog kNVGM nvpSA qwdi bmjsw \" data-testid=\"prism-GridRow\">\n<div class=\"theme-e oBTii mrzah \" data-testid=\"prism-GridColumn\">\n<p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Children get diagnosed because they&#8217;re disruptive and a pain to other people.

Hyperactivity may manifest as inner restlessness, inattention may look more like struggling to complete chores or meet deadlines, and impulsiveness can appear as difficulty managing a budget. Despite these challenges, many women with ADHD may appear externally as high-achieving perfectionists. But the consequences of a missed or misdiagnosis can be severe.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">(<i>Is there a link between ADHD and binge eating?<\/i>)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Compared to their neurotypical peers, women with ADHD are more likely to\u00a0suffer from anxiety and depression,\u00a0substance\u00a0abuse, and\u00a0eating disorders. They are also\u00a0five times more likely\u00a0to experience intimate partner violence,\u00a0seven times more likely\u00a0to have attempted suicide, and have higher rates of unplanned or early pregnancy. One Danish\u00a0study\u00a0showed that the risk of premature death in women with ADHD was more than twice that of men with ADHD, potentially due to women being less likely to be diagnosed and receive treatment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"RxNCg PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A shortage of ADHD specialists\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The explosion in diagnoses coincided with two potentially related factors: the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of TikTok. One survey\u00a0found that about 75 percent of newly diagnosed adults said the pandemic played a role in prompting them to explore an ADHD diagnosis, in part because of more time on social media platforms like Twitter and TikTok. Google search trends for ADHD rose faster between 2020 and 2022 than any other period since 2004, and the hashtag ADHD has amassed\u00a035 billion views\u00a0on TikTok in the United States in the past three years. Many women\u00a0report receiving a diagnosis only after self-referencing to a mental health professional, some having been spurred by a post on social media.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Even for those who decide to get a neuropsychological evaluation, finding a skilled provider is a challenge.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Psychiatrists get about half a day of training in adult ADHD over three years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">For decades, the prevailing attitude among psychiatrists was that kids grew out of ADHD.
