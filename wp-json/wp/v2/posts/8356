Stankey<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cWilderness is a cultural construct, rather than an intrinsic biophysical reality. To understand the meanings and values associated with wilderness today, it is necessary to understand the cultural context within which the concept was embedded initially\u2026 This essentially involves an examination of Western religious traditions and the effect these traditions have had on society\u2019s view of nature\u2026Because wilderness holds a variety of culturally imbued meanings, it is necessary to understand its cultural origins. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Judeo-Christian origins of Western society generally are credited with portraying wilderness as a synonym for desolate, wild, and uninhabited lands manifesting God\u2019s displeasure. But wilderness also served an essential function in Christianity as a place where one could prepare for contact with God. Such countervailing perspectives created an ambivalence that still prevails. Yet, despite the ambivalence, early Europeans and North American societies perceived wilderness as a threat. Although a variety of factors, including an increased scientific understanding of nature and the growing scarcity of wild country, have contributed to a greater appreciation of the value of wilderness and efforts to protect wilderness, there remain deep-seated emotions about wilderness. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As the antonym of civilization, wilderness retains an image for many people as a place of fear and foreboding and as an active challenge to civilization\u2019s survival. Perhaps deeply embedded in the genetic code of humans are the concerns of our ancestors as they huddled around the fire, listening to the sounds of the night around them, ever mindful of their precarious status and vulnerability. Today, it is civilization and society that surrounds the wilderness, its survival dependent upon our capacity to recognize the values it possesses and our willingness to ensure its preservation.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>WILDERNESS: A WESTERN CONCEPT ALIEN TO ARCTIC CULTURES. <\/strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br \/>\nBy David R. Klein<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The concept of wilderness in Western culture has its roots in Judeo-Christian fundamentalism. Europeans introduced this concept to North America as they set out to tame the western frontier. It was only after the wave of settlement had reached the Pacific coast that the desire to protect samples of wilderness emerged.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Humans now controlled the land and viewed themselves as separate from nature. This view of nature is embodied in the United States Wilderness Act of 1964. Indigenous peoples, however, whose cultures have evolved within wild lands based on hunting and gathering, are at home in these lands. Their lifestyles and very existence have been dependent upon a sustained harvest of resources from the land without altering nature.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Indigenous peoples are at the top of the trophic relationships within Arctic ecosystems and view themselves as part of nature. Although conservation of nature in the Arctic is today a common goal of both indigenous cultures and elements of Western culture, an increased understanding of culturally based differences in perceptions of nature is necessary if mutually acceptable conservation efforts are to succeed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Indigenous peoples of the Arctic are gaining deserved legal authority and responsibility for the administration of their homelands, which have only recently been recognized as such in Western society. Wilderness advocates are now turning their eyes northward and are beginning to perceive the as-yet-unrealized potential for wilderness opportunities in the Arctic. If the Arctic is to serve the growing interests of wilderness seekers from the south, those interests must be compatible with the interests and the well-being of the residents of the Arctic. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">This is particularly relevant given the current and presumably continuing trend in world politics toward recognition of the rights of indigenous peoples relating to the lands they occupy and their desire to protect values they cherish in their cultures. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But how differently do people who live south of the Arctic and indigenous people of the Arctic view the concept of wilderness? Aldo Leopold in the book Sand County Almanac (1949) described wilderness as: \u201cthe raw material out of which man has hammered the artifact called civilization&#8230;. To the labourer in the sweat of his labour, the raw stuff on his anvil is an adversary to be conquered. So, was wilderness an adversary to the pioneer? But to the labourer in repose, able for a moment to cast a philosophical eye on his world, that same raw stuff is something to be loved and cherished, because it gives definition and meaning to his life.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">These few perceptively chosen words by Leopold encompass two essential aspects of the evolution of the wilderness concept in Western society: first, the human striving to transform nature, and second, the more recent nostalgic and aesthetic valuation of wilderness by an affluent society no longer in direct contact with nature. This pattern, perhaps not surprisingly, parallels the historical shift in Western culture from its land-based origin to the technological industrial dominance of this century. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Western civilization has its roots in the city-states bordering the Mediterranean Sea, where the separation of urban dwellers from nature was considered a desirable outcome of civilization. Wilderness became antithetical to the development of Western society, as it was seen as an obstacle to human dominance over nature. However, as humans increasingly became separated from the natural environment, familiarity with it was lost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Thus, wilderness, which had nurtured humans throughout their evolution into the Stone Age, was now abandoned by civilized man and was relegated to the realm of the unknown, engendering the fear and foreboding that humans so typically ascribe to the unknown. The emerging new religions in the Mediterranean basin focused on the urban dweller. They reinforced the belief that wilderness was threatening to human society, harbouring the spirits of pagan animism as well as demons and devils of the new religions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Religious ideology underwent a transformation from the nature-based spirit world of hunter-gatherer societies to the abstract, single, human, and male all-powerful God of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Jerry Mander (1978) stresses that between 3000 and 2000 B.C., Hebrews won a political victory by renouncing worship of graven images, which were the symbolism of nature-based religions, while substituting their new anthropocentric religion that flourished in the expanding Western civilization. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Much later, the Industrial Revolution brought about an acceleration in the rate of human exploitation of the earth&#8217;s environment, fostered by the Reformation and the emergence of fundamental Protestantism. Max Weber (1930) ascribed the rapid development of industrialization and the associated growth of capitalism to the Protestant ideology that viewed the earth as a storehouse of resources explicitly available for human exploitation. Protestantism also provided a work ethic that supported and was supported by the rapid rise of capitalism. Human populations were exploding at the expense of wilderness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Nonetheless, by the beginning of the nineteenth century, the dominant view of wilderness in the West was shifting from the fundamentalist Judeo-Christian negative image of darkness and the home of evil and threatening elements to a more positive view that melded the rural pastoral landscape with undisturbed nature. An appreciation for wild nature was evolving, particularly in North America, where European immigrants had developed the land near the wilderness as the frontier was pushed westward across the continent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Appreciation of wild nature had become the central theme among an emerging cadre of American writers, including Charles Carleton, Henry David Thoreau and John Muir. Thus, the wilderness movement was born in North America as a satellite to the growing conservation movement that had been instrumental in bringing about the establishment of the world&#8217;s first national parks. For many, the culmination of the wilderness movement in the United States was the recognition by the U.S. Congress of the values of wilderness and the importance of wilderness preservation through the passage of the Wilderness Act in 1964 (U.S. Congress, 1964). This act designated federal lands, primarily within existing federal reserve lands (national parks, national forests, and national wildlife refuges), as wilderness and offered protection to assure its continued &#8220;community of life &#8230;untrammelled by man.&#8221; <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Official recognition of wilderness values by the U.S. Congress was primarily a consequence of the vigorous educational and lobbying activity of the environmental movement through citizens&#8217; advocacy organizations, the Wilderness Society, the Sierra Club, and the National Audubon Society. At the time, the Wilderness Act was branded by outspoken opponents, perhaps validly, as elitist legislation, serving the interests of a wealthy minority of the United States population. Subsequently, however, areas designated as wilderness throughout the United States under the Act have experienced rapidly increasing visitation, dominated by young people, often with only moderate or meagre levels of income. Nevertheless, only a minority of the American public visits wilderness areas. For most people in Western society today, wilderness is a concept, the reality of which they have not personally experienced. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The image of wilderness in the minds of many urban Americans, however weak it may be, is derived almost totally from television (the average American adult spends 4 hours per day in front of the TV screen). The proportion of TV time in support of wilderness preservation in the United States is probably a fraction of 1% (and most of that is on public TV, which is watched by less than 5% of the TV-viewing public). Contrast this with about 20% of commercial TV time in the United States devoted to advertising products that either directly or indirectly result in loss of the natural environment or damage to it through pollution, deforestation, land lost to development, overharvesting of marine resources, and scarification of the land through extraction of nonrenewable resources. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Even when the effort is made through TV, it is not possible to represent the depth, smells, and feel of wilderness through electronic media. Television lacks the potential to convey complexity to the viewer. The electronic media are flat, affecting only the visual and auditory senses in a filtered, superficial manner. It cannot express the nuances of life or the complexity of ecosystem relationships. Those who have not experienced nature by being in it, a part of it, cannot understand the beauty and richness of nature solely from the television screen. The aura of living systems does not lend itself to any abstract form of communication. It must be experienced in situ (Mander,1978). There is no simple solution to the conundrum of the perceived reality of the natural environment as depicted by TV. TV has captivated the minds of a majority of Western society. But TV, even in the unlikely event that the program time and motivation were to become available, is technologically incapable of conveying an understanding, an appreciation, and a reverential respect for wilderness values. Suppose television is able, in rare instances, to engender support for wilderness protection through programming. In that case, it is only through the viewing public&#8217;s willingness to accept the voice of electronic media as authority. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Unfortunately, the voice for the wilderness that comes from television is minuscule in contrast to the dominant materialistic, consumer-oriented, resource-exploitive voice that occupies the majority of prime-time TV. I do not intend these comments as merely an attack against television, but rather to emphasize the almost ineffective role that television plays in conveying the concept and reality of wilderness to the viewing public. Nevertheless, TV plays an effective role in shaping the views of the public, however distorted from reality they may be. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It is ironic that Western society, with its materialistic, technological preoccupation, its present economy that is unsustainable through its dependence on massive worldwide exploitation of non-renewable resources, and its dissociation from nature, has also been the source of political activism to protect remaining areas of the world&#8217;s wilderness. The wilderness preservation movement has its roots in America, fostered by the biocentric writings of John Muir and Aldo Leopold, and more recently supported by advocates of deep ecology (Devall and Sessions, 1985). The concept of humans as part of nature, which has remained an integral component of non-Western cultures, is viewed as a threat to the environment by many Western wilderness advocates (Guha,1989). <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The act of offering legal protection for the wilderness that is far removed from our everyday lives provides salve for our conscience, perhaps in recognition that we have lacked the will to initiate the major governmental and economic restructuring necessary if we are to move toward the sustainability of Western society. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But what is the meaning of wilderness in the Arctic? Is wilderness a concept alien to Arctic cultures? Cultures have evolved within the constraints imposed by the environments where they occurred. Indigenous people who have lived compatibly with nature have done so by necessity. Those that exceeded the bounds of their environmental constraints died out, and there are numerous examples whose artifacts left upon the landscape have provided fertile fields for archaeologists. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Cultures have waxed and waned about resource abundance, sustainability, and the level of exploitation. When cultures persisted and human populations remained stable, it was usually because the level of technology available for resource exploitation did not permit overexploitation. When new technology became available, either through innovation or by adoption from other cultures, increased exploitation of resources became possible. Human populations then expanded until either a new level of capability of resource exploitation was reached within the sustainability of the resources or overexploitation occurred and the human population declined, often to extinction, taking with it the associated culture. When advances in technology have led to increased human density, social interaction flourishes, and time becomes available for activities beyond subsistence. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Artistic skills developed, and spirituality became more complex, often incorporating feedback from resource limitations. If the food base was diverse, overexploitation of one resource did not necessarily lead to the demise of the human population. Given that the time was available, awareness of the need to regulate future use of the overexploited resource may have developed. Constraints may have become incorporated into the culture as taboos, moral injunctions, or religious sanctions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Cultures characterized by stability over long periods were logically those that did not overexploit, that were relatively free from influences of other cultures via technology exchange, competition for similar resources, warfare, and introduction of disease. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Cultures undergoing rapid change, due to the introduction of new technologies and ideologies, the exploitation of newly available resources, the domination and absorption of minority cultures, the occupation of new lands, or a population explosion, are likely to lose those constraints against resource overexploitation that had evolved with the cultures. This occurs because cultural attributes that yield long-term social benefits are lost in cultures undergoing rapid social change with associated population growth. Under such conditions, all aspects of culture, including value systems, become flexible and subject to change. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Cultures in isolation with stable or even declining population growth are resistant to change. Witness the stability of the Norse culture in Iceland during its isolation throughout the Little Ice Age. The written Icelandic language and agrarian-based culture remained intact, even though the sustainability of the land for livestock and crops declined to submarginal levels as a consequence of the cooling climate, widespread overgrazing, and soil erosion. A similar pattern appears to have preceded the demise of the Norse settlements in Greenland (Fredskild, 1988). The Norse in Greenland were so inflexibly tied to an agrarian economy and culture that they failed to transfer their dependence from the land, which could no longer support them, to the more abundantly available resources from the sea that became the sustenance for the Inuit who ultimately moved southward to replace them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Western concept of wilderness often includes the homelands of indigenous peoples. The Gwich&#8217;in people, Athabascan Indians living close to the northern limit of forests in northwestern Canada and adjacent Alaska, have a saying that &#8220;to understand our way you must stop for a moment and feel the rhythm of the land. For we are part of it&#8221; (S. James, pers. comm., l993). Before contact with Western culture, the Gwich&#8217;in knew of the caribou only in fall and winter, when they were present in their homeland. When the caribou left their wintering grounds in spring migration north to the calving grounds, they left the land of the Gwich&#8217;in. The calving grounds were in the land of the Inuit, the people who lived at the edge of the sea. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Caribou Cree of the northern coniferous forests of central Canada have had a similar relation to caribou (Ingstad, 1993). They knew that the caribou were in the north and absent from their lands in summer, to return in fall and winter, but not always. Wintering areas varied from year to year, and the migration routes followed. They spoke of the caribou as mystical and often unpredictable creatures, even though their culture had mainly evolved around caribou, their existence was dependent upon them, and they had intricate knowledge of the winter ecology of caribou. Nevertheless, they had a saying that &#8220;no one knows the way of the winds and the caribou&#8221; (Munsterheilm, 1953:97). <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The calving grounds of the caribou might be viewed as an analogue, in these caribou hunting cultures, to the Western concept of wilderness &#8211; a land beyond the realm of the known homeland. Similar areas might include those areas of the Arctic that could not support indigenous people, areas without harvestable resources and therefore of no utilitarian value, such as the tops of high mountains, ice caps, and expanses of the sea beyond safe exploitation. Such areas, although not visited except perhaps by shamans seeking powers from the spirit world, were, nevertheless, usually endowed with spiritual entities or power. They commanded respect even though they seldom or never visited. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But suppose such lands can be considered wilderness by the indigenous cultures of the Arctic. In that case, the concept is far removed from the wilderness of Western culture, which has values that can, for most people, be personally appreciated and exploited only through visitation, a place of retreat and restoration of self and soul. In indigenous cultures, the land is the source of being and is understood as such. In urban, industrialized, and monetarily-based cultures, the individual has lost direct contact with the land and has no genuine appreciation for the relationship of culture to the land via the commodities consumed that are products of the land (e.g., food, clothing, materials to construct homes, and paper that brings the printed word). <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In the Western concept, wilderness is valued by indigenous cultures for its productivity in their traditional homelands. In Western urban society, however, wilderness is valued not for its productivity but rather for its lack of productivity for human consumption. A significant disparity exists between the Western view of the Arctic wilderness and the indigenous view of the Arctic homeland. Is a marriage of the Western concept of wilderness with indigenous peoples&#8217; views of the land possible? Can the protection of natural areas in the Arctic serve the thirsts of Western society, while respecting and protecting the interests of indigenous peoples within their arctic homeland? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Because surviving cultures are not static, and both Western and Arctic indigenous cultures are undergoing rapid change, the targets that are the focus of legal action to protect wilderness in the Arctic are moving targets. It is not surprising that a divergence of views on measures for land protection exists within both cultures. Western culture is an amalgam of cultures (essentially, but not exclusively, European) that has and is undergoing rapid change. This accelerated change is the product of the industrial\/technological revolution. Unlike most of the cultures that it has absorbed and that had evolved over millennia of relative stability, Western culture is now a culture in transition, fuelled by the rapid increase in human population density and exploitation of largely non-renewable resources that are far removed from their consumers. It is a culture with little likelihood for the adoption of timely self-imposed constraints on its manner of resource exploitation that could lead to population and cultural sustainability. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Wilderness, as a concept, is also changing Western society. In the three decades since the passage of the Wilderness Act in the United States, there has been a rapid growth in wilderness visitors (users) in areas designated as wilderness. The wilderness experience, as defined by the Wilderness Act, should provide opportunities for solitude. Now, however, the experience must be shared with an increasing number of users in most designated wilderness areas. A consequence is that the wilderness character of these areas is being lost, but it is the concept that is being eroded, whereas the land remains largely unaltered. Jay Hansford Vest (1987) has pointed out the difficulty that federal agencies have encountered in attempting to manage wilderness areas to serve the aesthetic and poetic ideals encompassed in the Wilderness Act through objective management technology. The Wilderness Act is an attempt by a legal mandate to designate and protect areas of natural beauty to preserve wilderness. Naturalness and the solitude that can be experienced in the wilderness are lost to the wilderness seeker if numerous other humans are encountered. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Because concepts are in the human mind and not in the land itself, merely designating areas as wilderness does not guarantee that they will continue to fit the definition. Now, when I wish a wilderness experience, I increasingly select de facto wilderness, which remains less visited by wilderness seekers than those areas designated as wilderness, and advertised as such by the eco-tourism industry and government agencies responsible for administering them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The association of wilderness with solitude is being eroded in Western society. The wilderness concept has evolved throughout the history of Western civilization, and it would be naive to assume that further development of the idea will not occur. However, the concept remains a Western one, and the pressures of an increasing human population and urbanization drive the changes it is undergoing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Designation of wilderness areas in the homeland of indigenous peoples of the Arctic by governments and pressures based outside of the Arctic is an ethnocentric act that reflects ignorance of, and insensitivity to, the cultures, interests, and concerns of Arctic peoples. Although wilderness designation may protect the fish, wildlife, and other resources that are essential to the subsistence economy of arctic peoples, this benefit to arctic peoples is usually incidental to the primary intent of the designation and reflects a Western cultural bias. Similar results can be achieved, without invoking or reflecting cultural dominance, through intercultural negotiation leading to land use classifications designed to maintain the productivity of the land and waters for sustained harvest of resources by indigenous peoples, while offering opportunities for visitors from the south to experience the pristine nature that usually characterizes such environments. It is encouraging to note such a trend in Canada, where several new parks and other protected areas in the Arctic are the product of joint negotiations and efforts of cross-cultural groups. Visitors from the south should be fully aware when visiting the Arctic that they are usually guests in the homelands of cultures other than their own. Gaining an understanding of these cultures offers the potential to enhance rewards from their visit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Conversely, most Westerners, since the first Arctic explorers and whalers, have entered the Arctic assuming or claiming possession of the land and resources for themselves or their own countries, without consideration for the endemic cultures and peoples of the Arctic. The recent trend by arctic countries to recognize claims of arctic peoples to lands and resources is an encouraging sign that the historical perception held by Westerners of the Arctic and its peoples is being revised. It is only through mutual understanding and respect between cultures that there can be a marriage of interests to assure the long-term protection of natural areas in the Arctic. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Alternatively, the failure of people from diverse cultures to understand one another and to respect their differences inevitably leads to increasing polarization and alienation when contact between cultures occurs. Witness the opposition originating in southern urban centres to the harvest of marine mammals by arctic peoples, and the subsequent boycott of sealskins in Western markets. The future offers promise for the protection of nature in the Arctic. Still, it can be accomplished with the assurance of lasting benefits to the peoples of the Arctic and Western society only through increased mutual understanding and communication. Westerners must learn to find wilderness gratification when visiting the homelands of the Inuit, Sami, Evenki, and other arctic peoples without their specific designation as wilderness. We must continue to support the protection of the Arctic environment and the sustainability and productivity of the biological systems it encompasses. But its protection should be negotiated within the terms and conditions of the Arctic rather than by imposing cultural concepts that are alien to Arctic cultures. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>References<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Devall, B., and Sessions, G.1985.
