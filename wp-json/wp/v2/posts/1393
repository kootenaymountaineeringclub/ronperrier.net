Nelson, in particular, has a rich climbing history, with almost all of its trips based at Kokanee.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> On August 8, 1907, a letter from JW Cockle of Kaslo discussed the practicality of erecting a mountain chalet at the Kitchener Glacier (now Kokanee Glacier) in order to promote tourism in the Kootenays. He argued that the Kaslo route (Keen Creek) is superior to the Kokanee Creek route. \u201cThis is the second lying attempt to disparage the Kaslo route to the magnificent glacier and anyone who has ever been over the ground could not fail to see that the only feasible route was via Kaslo, and the finest chalet site in the world is on the Kaslo slope.\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> In response, FG Ebbutt of the Nelson 20,000 Club denies that his club has disparaged the Kaslo route and \u201cthis club would only be too happy to cooperate with you in anything that would tend to develop the possibilities of the district as a whole from the tourist point of view.\u201d The dream of a chalet at the foot of the glacier never materialized, and it is interesting how business-oriented these men are. Tourism seems to be much more critical now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">From the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Nelson Daily News of September 8, 1921<\/span>, is an article entitled \u201cMountaineers Storm Heights of Kokanee Glacier District\u201d. 39 climbers were enthusiastic about their trip \u201cThe memory of the enchanting glimpses of the enormous ice field, the magnificent rock buttresses, terraces, and pinnacles, no less the genial gaiety of their fellows throughout the trip, will live long with the novices as well as the veteran climbers of the party\u201d. They made their way from Nelson by boat and car to Molly Gibson Landing and then by foot to the camp at Molly Gibson Concentrator. All were \u201cmerry and bright\u201d and entertained by Pipe Major William McLeary. With bad weather, they didn\u2019t start for Kokanee Lake until 1:30 p.m.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Back in camp, they held the annual business meeting of the KMC, the Kokanee Mountaineering Club. Discussions were held about circulating photographs to boards of trade, tourist associations, and hotels. The provincial photographer was tasked with producing a film that would be sent on tour. The guests from Minneapolis and Ann Arbour, Michigan, wanted the film to be used in lectures back home. New officers were elected with Capt. CW Busk as honorary president and Ross Fleming as president. There were three committees: the Route Committee, the Park Committee, and the Publicity Committee.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> With good weather, they were up at 6 am and 20 members started for Mt Ganser, the highest peak in the range (Cond \u2013 9,200\u2019). Under deteriorating weather, 15 made it to the top, including Mrs. C.H. Ganser, in whose honour the club named the peak. The pipe major played his pipes against the forceful driving wind. A bottle with all participants&#8217; names was placed under a newly built cairn. They sang \u201cGod Save the King\u201d. That night, they were formally buried in a casket by Johnny Walker to the tune of \u201cFor He\u2019s a Jolly Good Fellow\u201d. \u201cOne member of the party, no less a person than Johnny Walker of international fame, who by a process of attrition had been laid low the night previous, had, unknown to the majority, succumbed, killed with kindness\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">September 5, 1932 \u2013 Nelson Daily News.<\/span> The article described a trip to Kokanee with a group of 22 led by Rev. George Kinney, who led the first, but unsuccessful, attempts on Mt Robson in 1908\/1909. It took 1\u00bd hours to drive from Kaslo to Joker Millsite, \u201ceven though the road was littered with remains of snakes which had broken their backs trying to get around the turns\u201d. They slept out in the open on balsam boughs.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Up at six, breakfast consisted of bacon and eggs, hotcakes, and coffee. They were divided into four groups. The third group wanted to be the first to eat fried pork sausages on the glacier and started off carrying dry wood, a large tin of sausages, and a frying pan. The two nurses present took everyone\u2019s pulse as their breathing was coming in short pants, and that their \u201cpants were getting shorter and shorter the higher they climbed\u201d. It was getting late when they crossed Coffee Pass; some turned back to avoid darkness, and \u201ctheir pants had grown too short\u201d. The sausage was cooked at the crest of the glacier between Cond and Esmeralda. \u201cThe 9000-foot elevation may interfere with the proper cooking of eggs, but it has no effect on the frying of sausages.\u201d Kinney became ill and finally got back to camp in the dark.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> After the rest left for home, group 3 hiked on the western trail to the Slocan Chief mine and Kokanee Mountaineering Club cabin. After signing the register of their climb at the cabin, they returned to camp and had a dinner of sirloin steak, French fried potatoes, fruit salad, and super-saturated coffee. Planning to get up at 5 to climb Kokanee Peak, they woke up after 8, didn\u2019t go, and spent most of the day eating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In 1989, <strong>Sue Port<\/strong> wrote about the club&#8217;s history on the occasion of its 25th anniversary. It was published in the Karabiner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>THE CLUB&#8217;S HISTORY<\/strong> <strong>&#8211; <\/strong><em><strong>A Brief History of the Kootenay Mountaineering Club and its Antecedent, the Kootenay Section of the Alpine Club of Canada<\/strong> \u00a0<\/em>by Sue Port\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In the 1950s and early 60s, there were many active hikers and climbers in the Kootenays. A few of them belonged to the national Alpine Club of Canada and wondered if more might join if a Section of the ACC was formed. Rick Askew and Jack Steed gathered information, while Kim Deane drew up a constitution. In April 1964, the Kootenay Section of the Alpine Club of Canada was formed, with 12 charter members. With it began the Club journal, the KOOTENAY KARABINER, created and edited for the first years by Chris Penn and Jack Oswald. Kim Deane was the first chairman, followed in November by Helen Butling.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> In the spring of 1968, Karabiner, Chris Penn, outlined the accomplishments of the early years: \u201cThe Kootenay Section of the Alpine Club now has some seventy members, and a more cheerful, lively, likable bunch would be hard to find. In the short time since the Section was founded, members have made climbs, explorations, and first ascents almost all over the Kootenay Region, they have cut and cleared trails, developed an excellent weekly rock school (at which it is nothing to see thirty people climbing), put on a year-round program of climbs and ski tours, held their own Centennial Climbing camp, produced their journal, fought hard for the preservation of Kokanee Provincial Park, and completely renovated the old Slocan Chief Cabin there.\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> There was indeed very active involvement in the Club at that time, with a very high attendance on many weekend trips (18 on Mt. Loki without a recce was judged excessive), a significant expenditure of energy on the Mulvey trail, and large work parties at the Slocan Chief (32 people over four weekends in 1965). There were also notable first ascents of Mounts Pambrun and Thor, as well as peaks and routes in the Mulvey area.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> However, the overwhelming majority of those seventy lively members were merely Section Associates. An ACC bylaw required that full ACC members fill certain executive positions, and these became too few to continue rotating as Club officers. Although the Kootenay Section tried to introduce changes to its Constitution that would allow it to continue, when an executive was elected that violated the bylaw, the ACC dissolved the Section in early 1969.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The executive continued, and as Chairman, Iain Martin stated in the Spring 1969 issue of the KARABINER. \u201cUnder the new name of Kootenay Mountaineering Club, it is business as usual for us.\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> What did the next 20 years bring? They brought in many new members, totalling 225 in 1988. However, the core of those who are very actively involved has not increased proportionately, and the problem of finding leaders and executive members seems to be a constant one. The weekend trip schedule has expanded since the early years, when there were trips approximately every other weekend. The Club now offers a choice between an easy and strenuous trip each summer weekend, with weekly ski, hiking, or climbing trips available much of the year. Fewer trips are into Kokanee Glacier Park now that logging roads and four-wheel drive vehicles have opened up so many other areas, but many of the familiar trips are still as popular.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The popular annual ski trips into the Slocan Chief Cabin at Easter and May 24th are no more. Instead of KMCers being almost the only users of the cabin, it is now widely known, and its winter use is determined by an elaborate \u201clottery.\u201d Rogers Pass has become the new Easter weekend destination. With the advent of telemark gear, there are many more skiers in the backcountry, with some Club members enthusiastically using any open logging roads as access to the slopes.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Week-long camps have always been an essential part of KMC activities, from the first Centennial Camp at Earl Grey Pass in 1967 to the four-week climbing and hiking camps, attended by 80 members in 1988. The first six camps were \u201cgeneral\u201d ones, with the first separate hiking camp being held at beautiful Bonnie Gem Lake in 1974. The comfort level increased considerably with the purchase of a large cook tent and propane stoves before the 1973 Gold Range camp, and the acquisition of a second set of gear in 1979 greatly improved relations between competing hikers and climbers. All could now hope to enjoy that sometimes elusive, fine summer weather as camps could now operate simultaneously.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Some climbing camps have been held in rarely visited areas and have resulted in several first ascents, new routes, and the naming of mountain features, while hiking camps, which have also provided a few new routes, have often inspired poetry, paintings, and masquerade madness.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The debate over huts \u2013 do they lessen or increase the wear on fragile alpine areas? It is still with us. The Club has built only one hut, but it has been involved with several others over the years. Much time and effort went into the Slocan Chief Cabin in the early years, both in saving it from collapse and in the annual maintenance and wood gathering (the fall work parties were social events as well, and there was the lure of Helen\u2019s lemon pies!). This maintenance was taken over by the Parks Branch in 1977.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> From the start, the Club was interested in building its Section hut. In 1969, the Mulvey hut was prefabricated in Rossland by members and other volunteers and subsequently erected during a camp in Mulvey Meadows. What a welcome sight it was after the struggle up the Mulvey headwall. By the mid-1970s, there was easier access up Bannock Burn Creek, and the hut received heavy use. However, with the closure of the road in 1980, the hut\u2019s use declined drastically. Once again, it is accessible, but its future in the new Valhalla Park is uncertain. In the late spring of 1989, the Parks Branch had to burn down the Mulvey Hut, a victim of twenty years of weather and wear, and of a bizarre and tragic accident.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Huckleberry Hut, an old mining cabin, has been maintained since 1963, with major reconstruction at that time and again in 1986. The Ridge Cabin, on the way to Old Glory, was preserved in the 1970s, but in July 1989, it burned to the ground. The cause of the fire is unknown; however, lightning is suspected to be the cause.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> New responsibilities were undertaken in 1986 with the KMC sponsorship of a federal work grant project to build ski touring cabins in the Bonnington Range. This resulted in the construction of the Copper and Grassy Mountain Huts, with plans for a third hut near Siwash Mountain in the future, part of the Kootenay Haute Route.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> With the completion of the Mulvey Creek Trail in 1968, the Club has not been as involved in trail building since. This trail fell into disuse with the opening of the Bannock Burn road access and has now been abandoned to the grizzlies, who made memorable trips of a couple of climbing parties. Most subsequent years saw at least one trail-clearing trip on the schedule \u2013 Joker Lakes, Paupo Basin, Enterprise Creek, and Drinnon Lake &#8211; but the turnout has decreased over the years.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> There have also been numerous KMC letters written to request improved access to the mountains, with some notable successes including the Woodbury Creek bridge (both in the 1960s and the 1980s), the Keen Creek bridges, and the removal of the gates on the Little Slocan Road.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> When the Club began, there were many enthusiasts but few climbers. An informal Wednesday evening Rock School at the Kinnaird Bluffs proved popular and has evolved over the years into the present mountaineering course, comprising lectures, rock climbing evenings, and day and weekend courses on snow and glacier travel at Ymir Mt. and Glacier Creek, subject to access permitting. Tape waist slings have given way to standard-issue harnesses and hard hats, but the same question remains: Where do all the students go after they complete the course?<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> It was expected that some of these enthusiasts might get lost or hurt. Soon after the formation of the Kootenay Section, an active Mountain Rescue group began training and continued for about ten years. Although it was mentioned on a few occasions, enthusiasm waned, and it was disbanded in 1977.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> In 1963, Club members took on the responsibility of recording data from the snow survey course near the top of Old Glory to continue the long record kept by the former Weather Station there. This involved monthly trips from January to May \u2013 the early and late trips being made more interesting by the lack of daylight or snow. In 1975, this was moved to the more accessible Record Ridge, although Old Glory was also surveyed until 1983.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Since members spend, or dream of spending, so much time in the backcountry, it was natural that the Club has become involved in many conservation issues, local and provincial, over the years. The protection of Kokanee Park has been an ongoing struggle. The early protests against the downgrading of the Park to Class B to allow mineral exploration\/exploitation were repeated against specific provisions of the Park Master Plan in 1987. Currently, the Park core is Class A and secure, but undoubtedly, the struggle will continue in the adjacent Recreation Areas.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The KMC was the first organization to work on creating a park in the Valhallas, submitting its brief to the Provincial Government in 1970. It continued to lobby for this over the years, supporting the Valhalla Wilderness Society and participating in the 1987 Valhalla Park Master Plan process. Fifteen years ago, when the Fry Creek drainage was threatened by logging, the KMC prepared a brief on Fry Creek and the Purcell Wilderness Conservancy, which is now in the midst of a Master Plan process. Once again, the KMC is collaborating with other groups to preserve these areas.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Numerous other letters have been written to voice members&#8217; protests against the short-term gain philosophy of some government bodies and businesses, and submissions on both Kokanee and the Purcells were sent to the Wilderness Advisory Committee during its hearing in 1985\/1986.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> There is also involvement in other provincial conservation and land-use issues through KMC&#8217;s membership, dating back to 1975, in the Federation of Mountain Clubs of BC. Although we at times feel far removed from this coast-dominated body, it is becoming an important and respected voice in the province, and stronger ties are being sought.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Of course, we KMCers get together not only in the mountains but at semi-annual dinners (how else to get a quorum for an AGM?), for evenings of slides and various other excuses for a party. Club members have shared their travels and exploits in many mountainous parts of the world \u2013 Nepal, Peru, the Haute Route, the Coast Range, and other exotic places \u2013 and guests such as Hans Gmoser, Doug Scott, Gaston Rebuffat (such a flurry of bilingual correspondence in 1966), Pat Morrow, Jon Jones, John Roskelley and many others in the community.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Through the years, the KOOTENAY KARABINER has recorded most of these activities. The semi-annual journal became annual in 1970, and a monthly Newsletter was added. The Club is also very fortunate to possess a complete set of the CANADIAN ALPINE JOURNAL. Most of the volumes were the gift of Dr. Anne Norrington in 1964, with others contributed by Helen Butling. These, along with a few dozen mountaineering books and related items, comprise the KMC library.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> What is missing from this account is the most essential item: the names of the many individuals who have worked hard over the years to make everything happen. They have led trips, organized camps, kept the finances in order, ruled over unruly meetings, edited the Karabiner and Newsletter, written briefs and letters, built huts, cleared trails, shown slides, tied students up in knots at the bluffs and thrown them down crevasses in the Truce Glacier, some for a season or two, and others for more years than they care to remember.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> We hope that the members will continue to do so for the next 25 years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>KMC HISTORY 1989-2017<\/strong>\u00a0by Ron Perrier<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">By 1989, Valhalla Provincial Park, Fry Creek Canyon Recreation Area, and the Purcell Wilderness were all established, and the club played an active role in that process. A big Anniversary Party was held, featuring entertainment from the \u201cKootenay Puppet Theatre Group.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong> Helen Butling,<\/strong> one of the founding members of the club, served as president for several years and was a driving force in all club affairs, passing away in 1989. Her \u201ccookbook\u201d served as the basis for many of the recipes that are still used today in Hiking Camp. She also organized the volunteers who worked yearly on the Slocan Chief Cabin. Fighting hard on conservation issues, she was awarded the ACC&#8217;s prestigious service award for outstanding contributions to Canadian Mountaineering.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Another founding member of the club, Jack Steed, and his son, Jamie, died in an avalanche in Kokanee in 1990. Two mountains south of Mt. Pambrun in the Purcells were named the \u201cSteeds\u201d on the recommendation of the club, and a cabin in the Bonnington Range is the Steed cabin. The constitution of the club was amended to allow only residents of the Kootenays to become new members. The climbing and hiking camps had become too successful. I believe that Kal Singh was the only member still in the club in 2014 who had never lived in the West Kootenay. Hiking camp was extended to three weeks in 1985. Firewood was flown in for the first time, and we used a fire pan for the first time in 1990. Seven members skied from Rogers Pass to the Bugaboos.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> In 1991, the club&#8217;s primary concern was the resort at Jumbo Pass. In 1992, <strong>Laurie Charlton<\/strong> took over responsibility for Hiking Camp, and as a one-person committee, made a considerable contribution in organizing it. John Walton was our representative to the provincial CORE process and spent many hours and weeks on that project, which continued until 1994. The Siwash Hut was constructed between 1993 and 1996. The new Silverspray Cabin was built by the Friends of West Kootenay Parks Society under the leadership of John Carter in 1994. Forty-six helicopter loads were brought up in one day, and the cabin was not finished until November.<\/p>\n<p>The unfortunate death of 6 skiers in an avalanche in 1999 at Silverspray resulted in it being closed for the winter. The cairned route from Drinnon to Mulvey was removed for safety reasons! The trail to Wee Sandy Lake was improved.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In 1995, six new provincial parks were created, and additions were made to several, including many in the West Kootenay region. Lockhart Creek, West Arm (protecting the Nelson watershed), Gladstone (at the north end of Christina Lake), Granby, and Goat Range were all established. Syringa and Kokanee both saw extensions, and the Purcell Wilderness Conservancy was created with significant additions at Fry and Carney Creeks. The club continued to play an active role in conservation issues.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The Kinnaird Bluffs, the club&#8217;s primary climbing area, were sold in 1995 for real estate development; however, access has been maintained, and the Bluffs remain an active climbing area. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>John Carter,<\/strong> the author of the original hiking guide for the area, \u201cHiking the West Kootenay\u201d (1993), a park ranger at Kokanee, and a 30-year member of the KMC, was killed in an avalanche on Smugglers Ridge on February 26th, 1996. Bob Dean, after years of organizing and leading summer trips, resigned in 1996. This was also the 100th anniversary of the Slocan Chief Cabin. Hamish Martin died while climbing on the Mt MacBeth Icefields in June 1997. He was 25.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Ron Perrier started the register program in 1997. The club paid for the manufacture of summit registers, and they were placed wherever the club was going, beginning in 1998. The first 50 had orange test caps, which the rodents liked to chew, and most of these required replacement. Producing a waterproof tube is more difficult than one would imagine. They are now on over 200 summits throughout the Kootenays. Vicky Hart is now the coordinator of the register program. Visit the website to view a list of all the summits with a registration form.<\/p>\n<p>Bicycle trips were added to the summer schedule on Fridays in the good hands of Carol Potasnyk. Digital reports were becoming common, greatly appreciated by the editors of the Newsletter and Karabiner. Hamish Mutch finished climbing all 17 peaks over 11,000\u2019 in the Interior Ranges with his climb of Farnham in August 1998. The conservation committee was active in the Jumbo Resort and Retallack Alpine Adventure (their expansion to the north side of Hwy 31A was denied) applications. The Bonnington Huts received improvements under club direction. Work parties continued to experience difficulties in recruiting volunteers.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The go-ahead for a KMC website was given after much discussion in 2000. This was the last year for the Mountaineering School run by a large group of climbers in the club. After some classroom nights, there was rock climbing at the Kinnaird Bluffs, a day of ice axe use and belaying on Mt Ymir, and then a weekend on the Horseshoe Glacier at Glacier Creek. Sandra McGuiness then ran the mountain school very capably until 2012.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br \/>\n<strong>Earl Jorgenson<\/strong> died in February 2001. He was an active 25-year member of the club and the designer and builder of the kitchen counter, the little yellow stools, the ironing board on which we do dishes and hold coffee, tea, and wine, and the seat for the bathroom, all for Hiking Camp. Bob Dean was given a lifetime membership to the club \u2013 a well-deserved honour. Mt John Carter was named for the highest point on the ridge of Outook Mountain.<\/p>\n<p>The last Karabiner covered the period from 1998 to 2000 but was not available until 2003. It was decided, due to cost reasons, workforce issues, and a lack of interest, to discontinue it permanently in 2003 after 40 volumes. The KMC Newsletter was to take on both functions. The conservation committee was involved in the applications for Red Mountain and Baldface.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br \/>\nIn 2002, the club was involved in the site selection and design of the Kokanee Glacier Alpine Hut. $800,000 was raised by the Trudeau legacy. The northeast corner of Kaslo Lake was selected, and construction began in 2002. The Slocan Chief Cabin was converted into an interpretive center. The existing Ranger cabin, Ranger Workshop, and the Kalmia Campground were closed. The Ministry of Forests had its budget reduced by $188 million, and the main casualty was road maintenance. We saw the adverse effects of this in 2012, as three roads into Kokanee were not usable \u2013 Enterprise Creek, Keen Creek, and Woodbury. The constitution was amended in several areas to allow for limited membership to non-West Kootenay residents. The ACC took over the operation of the Kokanee Glacier, Woodbury, and Silverspray Huts.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br \/>\nIn 2005, we rejoined the Federation of Mountain Clubs of BC to obtain more affordable liability insurance. This effectively doubled our membership dues. Norman Thyer, a member of the club for 40 years and a proponent of the esoteric, died in 2006. Steven Horvath, another long-time, 35-year member of the club and one of the \u201cclimbers,\u201d died after falling down a crevasse in July 2008. The Nature Conservancy of Canada bought Darkwoods, a large tract of private land south of Nelson. Snowshoe trips were added to the winter trip list, initiated by Don Harasym.<\/p>\n<p>Some members were real forces in their area &#8211; Ross Bates and the Sheppards in Castlegar, Bill Sones in Nakusp, and Marlene Johnston in the Kaslo area. In 2012, 2 valuable members, Sandra McGuiness and Doug Brown, moved out of the area. They advanced technical issues in mountaineering, ran the mountain school, held many executive positions, and organized and led numerous trips both in the summer and winter.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br \/>\nAs of 2013, our 50th Anniversary Year, the club has several continuing issues. Our conservation committee continues to deal with the Jumbo Resort and the Glacier-Howser power proposal. It has been a strong voice in preserving the West Kootenay as wild as possible. Ted Ibrahim and Kim Kratky have shouldered the majority of that responsibility. The Karabiner is gone. The Kinnaird Bluffs, along with many other climbing areas around Nelson and Castlegar, provide great sport climbing opportunities. Reduced funding in the Ministry of Forests and Parks has decimated road access to some of our most popular hiking areas. The Friday bicycle trips don\u2019t seem to be as frequent. Climbing Camp hasn&#8217;t been held for several years. Organizing work parties, especially for trail work, gets more difficult with each passing year.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The Bonnington Huts have been maintained to a high standard. Hiking Camp remains hugely popular and is considered the best week of the year. Run entirely by volunteers with rarely a glitch, the cost remains relatively low (although primarily due to helicopter costs, the price is twice what it was 20 years ago). The hiking camp retains a surplus in the bank and has recently purchased new tents. The Website has been a resounding success, and it was redesigned in 2014. Most members receive the Newsletter electronically on the website. <strong>Kim Kratky<\/strong> has always been the major contributor to both the Karabiner and the Newsletter. Having climbed virtually every mountain in the West Kootenay and beyond, he has been generous with his superb articles. Unfortunately, Kim died in 2013 after a battle with brain cancer. A well-attended memorial was held. He will be missed.<\/p>\n<p>The constitution has undergone two major updates to keep it current. AGMs continue to be held after dinner. The social aspects of the club are well-run, producing a real sense of community. We continue to offer an active winter schedule of skiing, snowshoeing, and summer hiking.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The club itself has had a legion of volunteers committing vast amounts of time to making the club run very effectively. That is our real strength. I apologize if I have left out anyone, as many members contribute to the club. Our membership numbers remain strong, although we could always use more young members.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The club is aging gracefully. We have a club we should all be justly proud of. The 50th anniversary took place in 2014, and several activities were held. The AGM of the Federation of Mountain Clubs was hosted in June in Castlegar by the club, featuring Dave Quinn as the guest speaker. Badges were produced for members succeeding in climbing ten, twenty-five, or fifty mountains.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The membership steadily increased from 336 in 2013, to 352 in 2014 and to its highest level ever, 375 in 2015. The Jumbo project, which the club has vigorously opposed for over two decades, appears to have finally been put to rest, a great relief to everyone. The club contributed $10,700 to the building of the Lepsoe Basin Hut in the Rossland Range. The club made a record revenue of $11,000 from the rental of its Bonnington Range cabins, very popular with winter tourers from all over the province. At least 70% must be used for maintenance, but up to 30% can be directed towards other club activities.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Another long-time member, Graham Kenyon, passed away. He attended the first Hiking Camp and contributed many philosophical meanderings to the newsletter and Hiking Camp reports. Ross Scott passed away in December 2015. We will all miss his annual Hiking Camp slide shows and CDs of photos from hiking camps, which he distributed for free to all camp members.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In 2016, the club contributed $1,000 (with matching contributions from individual KMC members) to the purchase of Kinnaird Bluffs, ensuring access to climbing. The 17 acres were purchased by the Association of West Kootenay Rock Climbers, to eventually transfer the land to the City of Castlegar for use as a park and for rock climbing. The Lepsoe Basin Cabin in the Rossland Range was used heavily by KMC members. The future of the Bonnington Huts was questioned, as they are showing their age and require a significant amount of volunteer work by the club (Graham Jamin, in charge of the huts, has resigned). They are not used much by members, but are used much more often by snowmobilers. The 3-year contract with Darkwoods was renewed (5 visits\/year, weekends only). Trail clearing occurred at Cody Caves, Mt. Ferrie, Siwash, and Lost Mountain. There were 364 members, comprising 205 individuals and 178 couples.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Ron Perrier<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Sue Port &amp; Ron Perrier KMC &#8211; Kokanee Mountaineering Club In past issues of the KMC Karabiner, older articles from the Nelson Daily News were published, providing fascinating insights into mountaineering in the early 1900s.
