It is the single most important thing you should get but hope to never have to use. And for the little money it costs a day, you\u2019re foolish not to get it. Travel insurance is something you absolutely need on the road. You never know what could happen.<br \/>\nBecause of the myriad types of plans and companies out there, travel insurance is one of the most complex and confusing aspects of trip planning. Travel insurance is accident insurance. It is there to protect you in case of emergency.<br \/>\nThe kind of insurance depends on a lot of factors. You\u2019ll have to ask yourself a few questions. Are you a short-term traveler going away for a few weeks\/months? Or are you a long-term traveler leaving for a year or more?<br \/>\nDo you carry a lot of very expensive gear, or not? Do you have pre-existing conditions? Are you the type of person who books hotels\/flights\/activities in advance? Or do you just wing it and pay for services as you use them? If you never book flights more than a few days in advance, then trip cancellation insurance may not be necessary.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What to look for in a great plan<\/strong><br \/>\nThere are a lot of options out there, and, often, in the fine print, you\u2019ll find that plans aren\u2019t as good as you thought. They should cover most countries in the world.<br \/>\n1. <strong>Travel Health Insurance<\/strong> is coverage for accidents, injuries, and hospital visits while you are away from home. Most health plans don\u2019t cover you overseas. Travel medical insurance covers your medical expenses for injury, sudden accident and sudden illnesses and 24-hour emergency services but not preexisting diseases, routine health care like check-ups or regularly prescribed medications (like insulin). For example, if you have a heart condition and develop a problem on the road, you will likely not be covered. The medical portion of travel insurance is more about emergency care than being a replacement for your normal health care.<br \/>\nMake sure they have a high coverage limit &#8211; good companies provide at least $100,000, and many plans have a maximum of $one million. Hospital bills can be very expensive especially in the United States (travel insurance for the US will be more expensive than other countries).<br \/>\n2. <strong>Medical Evacuation Insurance<\/strong> is coverage for transporting you to a major hospital for treatment. This means evacuation from a natural disaster, to a hospital, or from the hospital back to your home country. Some evacuation insurance may cover emergencies, strife or civil war in the country visited, etc., that cause you to head home early.<br \/>\n3. <strong>Baggage\/Property Insurance<\/strong> is coverage for theft or damage to your gear while traveling. It covers lost, damaged or stolen possessions like jewelry, baggage, documents, cameras, and your electronics (most companies only cover a small amount, usually up to $500 USD as part of their basic coverage for electronics. You can often buy supplemental insurance to get a higher amount of coverage. Clements Insurance offers special coverage for your electronics with prices varying depending on the country you visit (between $145-195 per plan) but they don\u2019t have worldwide coverage. You have to get coverage for your specific country. Moreover, many regular and home insurance companies such as State Farm offer plans that can help you cover your electronics.)<br \/>\n4. <strong>Trip Cancellation Insurance<\/strong> is coverage for unexpected interruptions in your travel plans. It covers cancellations such as hotel bookings, flight, and other transportation bookings if you have a sudden illness, death in the family, or some other emergency. Have financial protection if any company you are using goes bankrupt and you are stuck in another country.<br \/>\n5. <strong>Legal Expenses<\/strong>. Some plans may cover any legal expenses that may be incurred.<br \/>\n6. Coverage for Countries with Travel Advisories<br \/>\nTraveling in countries with travel advisories can invaludate Nowhere do some of the issues of exclusion clauses come into play more than in Africa.<br \/>\nThe Canadian Government issues four categories of travel advisory. What follows are the categories as applied to this trip from Morocco to South Africa.<br \/>\n1. Avoid all travel: Mali, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.<br \/>\n2. Avoid non-essential travel: Mauritania, Nigeria, Republic of Congo.<br \/>\n3. High Degree of Caution (some with regional exceptions where it is safer): Senegal, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Togo, Ghana, Benin, Gabon, Cameroon and Angola.<br \/>\n4. No restrictions: Morocco, Namibia, South Africa.<br \/>\nThe government of the UK has different classifications and different warnings.<br \/>\nNo travel insurance company covers acts of terrorism, war or political upheaval in addition to all the usual multitude of exclusions. Basically all insurance covers normal illness and accidents.<br \/>\nOasis Overland has an affiliation with Campbell Irvine Insurance of the UK that offers travel insurance for these countries. Several clients on this trip purchased this insurance. It was at least twice the price of the insurance I had. But many others didn\u2019t as the sales pitch for their policies stated they covered every country when in fact they didn\u2019t. Not many people go to Mauritania, Mali or all these dodgy places.<br \/>\nIt certainly was not clear that it was mandatory to have insurance for every country we pass through. Without it, it appeared that continuing on the trip would not have been possible. We all came to understand this about two weeks into the trip as we approached Mauritania. Nine clients purchased a supplemental policy through Campbell Irvine then over the phone via Oasis. The average cost was 83\u00a3.<br \/>\nPersonally, I started the trip with two policies. One is a 31-day, multiple trip policy that I used for the first 31 days. I hadn\u2019t bothered reading it closely, but exclusion #23 cited any country with a travel advisory. The category of advisory was not stated. As a result, I would not have been covered until December 11.<br \/>\nMy second policy (TuGo offered through the BCAA) however covered them all and I was able to top up the policy to the beginning of December for a small fee, before we were to enter Mauritania. TuGo covers diving.<br \/>\nTravel insurance, especially since 9\/11, has become increasingly expensive. At age 60, prices climb appreciably until they are almost unaffordable by 70. For Canadians, it is also almost impossible to buy travel insurance if you are not a member of your provincial health plan. I never purchase trip cancellation insurance. Most of my flights are not booked long before and exclusions often prevent payouts anyway. I avoid extreme adventure activities and don\u2019t purchase insurance for my electronics.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What isn\u2019t covered is just as important as what is.<\/strong><br \/>\nMost policies do not cover accidents sustained while participating in extreme adventure activities such as hang gliding, paragliding, diving or bungee jumping unless you pay extra. The majority of companies won\u2019t cover you if you injure someone on the road (called third-party liability). Policies do not normally cover alcohol- or drug-related incidents, or carelessness in handling your possessions and baggage. You won\u2019t get reimbursed if the problem happened because you were reckless, and how \u201creckless\u201d is defined is a matter up to each company. Simply put, if a reasonable person wouldn\u2019t partake in what caused your accident, you won\u2019t be covered.<br \/>\nTravel advisories (see above) may invalidate insurance. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Making a claim<\/strong><br \/>\nIf you make a claim, remember that any travel insurance company, no matter how good, is there to make money and will try to avoid paying out as much as they can. Good medical insurance will not require the bills to be paid by the claimant. In order to ensure that you do get paid your claim, make sure you have all your receipts, necessary forms, and proper documentation like police reports (Keep the story simple. The longer &#038; more in-depth the report, the easier it will be for the insurance company to find a loophole that they can use to deny your claim!).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Insurance Providers. <\/strong><br \/>\nShop around before you make your final purchase. All plans are different and you want one to suit the type of trip you are taking. For example, if you don\u2019t participate in high-risk activities, avoid expensive plans that cover those. Or if your credit card has trip cancellation insurance on purchases made with the card, or you don\u2019t book your tickets months ahead but just before you need them, you do not need trip cancellation insurance.<br \/>\nHere are a few of the top travel, medical, and personal property insurance providers with a short description of what they do &#038; do not cover. These are definitely not the only insurance options out there though.<br \/>\nThere are many available plans that are more specific for your country. For example, for Canadians: surehealth.ca, bcaa.com, skymed.com,<br \/>\nExample quotes were obtained using these details: 30 year old single male with no pre-existing conditions.
