It was home to thriving cities and thousands of people, but over the course of two centuries, major cities would be emptied, with their grand temples abandoned and vivid artworks unfinished.Much like its ending, the exact beginning of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/history\/article\/who-were-the-maya\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Maya culture<\/a> has been difficult to pin down. Many scholars believe it first coalesced sometime between 7000 B.C. and 2000 B.C. after hunter-gatherers from South America moved into Mesoamerica and settled there. Sometime around 4000 B.C., the cultivation of corn, their staple crop, exploded, allowing Maya culture to flourish and expand.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"EmbedInline\">\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--below-paragraph InlineElement--content-width InlineElement--desktop\" aria-label=\"markup\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption Caption--hideEndBug\">\n<p class=\"Caption__Title\" aria-hidden=\"false\"><span class=\"RichText\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">THE MAYA WORLD<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span class=\"RichText\">At its height, during the Late Classic period (A.D. 600-900), Maya civilization formed a constellation of kingdoms and cities that stretched across the Yucatan Peninsula and Central America, almost 125,000 square miles. Scholars estimate that there were as many as 40 Maya cities controlled by powerful local rulers. The largest ones, like Tikal, had up to 50,000 residents, while the smaller cities\u2019 populations were closer to 5,000.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"static--markup\">\n<div class=\"ng-locator-map ng-locator-map-theme-light\" data-ng-locator-map=\"\" data-ng-locator-map-processed=\"true\">\n<div class=\"ng-locator-map-inner maplibregl-map mapboxgl-map\">\n<div class=\"maplibregl-canvas-container mapboxgl-canvas-container\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Interaction with the neighboring Olmec civilization is believed to have spurred advances in Maya architecture, resulting in the construction of huge ritual complexes surrounded by cities. Among the most important urban centers were Uxmal, Palenque, Chiche\u0301n Itza\u0301, Tikal, Copa\u0301n, and Calakmul. Built during the Classic period (A.D. 200-900), the Maya\u2019s soaring pyramid temples and grand buildings\u2014believed by some to be palaces\u2014were richly decorated with sacred art dedicated to the gods.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/history\/article\/maya-laser-lidar-guatemala-pacunam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Laser scans reveal Maya megalopolis beneath the jungle<\/i><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Power struggles<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Scholars have determined that the Maya did not rule as a unified empire.

It occupied a strategic position on the region\u2019s trade routes and was linked politically with the powerful Maya city of Calakmul.

In the first decades of the ninth century, a political and social crisis affected almost all Maya cities. By the end of the Classic period, Maya sculptors had stopped carving monuments, scribes had ceased recording their rulers\u2019 deeds, and workers had halted construction on palaces and temples. Cities were abandoned. What became known as the Maya collapse was just beginning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The collapse\u2014a decline that spread from city to city\u2014lasted more than a hundred years.

Whatever struck these cities hit them quickly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Maya collapse has been studied by countless scholars, who have developed fascinating theories to solve the mystery of the collapse. Many agree that there was no single cause but rather a complex combination of factors that led to the fall of Maya society.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Stresses and strains<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There are many collapse hypotheses, and most draw on several common factors. One is that overpopulation in Maya cities helped trigger this crisis by overstraining local resources. At the beginning of the ninth century, Maya civilization reached the peak of its demographic curve. Tikal, in present-day Guatemala, was the most populous of all the Maya cities and had grown to around 50,000 inhabitants. Some scholars believe that local agriculture, even if expanded, would struggle to support the population. In terms of demography, it\u2019s not clear how the populations redistributed themselves after abandoning the cities.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--content-width InlineElement--desktop ImageGroup__Wrapper\" aria-label=\"Image Pair\">\n<div class=\"ImageGroup__Images\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure id=\"561ac241-d46a-42e3-a4ca-e196abeb6007_0\" class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/050c3c66-5a7b-4249-92b6-58a5b0580624\/Maya11.jpg?w=1144.7999696731567&amp;h=1488.599960565567\" alt=\"A bust of a Maya high dignitary from circa A.D. 600-900\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/span><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"CenterCropFrame\">\n<div class=\"CenterCropFrame__Frame\">\n<div class=\"CenterCropFrame__Child-Wrap\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure id=\"561ac241-d46a-42e3-a4ca-e196abeb6007_1\" class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent\">\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/b9acfd11-a784-4390-95de-da6f994b3a1e\/Maya5.jpg?w=1144.7999696731567&amp;h=1241.999967098236\" alt=\"A figurine of a Maya dignitary from the late classic period, A.D. 600 to 900\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/span><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<p class=\"Caption__Title\" aria-hidden=\"false\"><span class=\"RichText\" style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">MAYA DIGNITARIES<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A strong contender is that drought led to the collapse. Recent studies on the Mesoamerican paleoclimate suggest that around the ninth century, a prolonged water shortage occurred in some regions of the Maya lowlands, leading to crop losses and localized famines. Food shortages challenged the Maya leaders\u2019 control of the region. Perhaps people fled to search for more fertile lands, or maybe they rebelled against their ajaws.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Another factor that undoubtedly contributed to the Maya collapse was armed conflict stemming from power struggles. Fighting blocked roads and trade routes, so that goods could not be moved around quickly, leading to shortages, economic collapse, and mass population migrations. In the ninth century, there was an increase in the number of texts that allude to warfare between cities. Various carved panels show ajaws holding enemies captive. The names of these defeated rulers are carved on their legs and tunics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/magazine\/article\/maya-empire-snake-kings-dynasty-mesoamerica\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Who were the Snake Kings, the Maya&#8217;s most powerful alliance?<\/i><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--content-width InlineElement--desktop ImageGroup__Wrapper\" aria-label=\"Image Pair\">\n<div class=\"ImageGroup__Images\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure id=\"c73c24fa-5361-4e0a-b1c1-c69012459c35_0\" class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/53683262-942f-40bc-b9d8-c8ba8740616a\/Maya6.jpg?w=1144.7999696731567&amp;h=2726.9999277591705\" alt=\"Stela 12, a block of stone with a scene carved into it\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/span><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"CenterCropFrame\">\n<div class=\"CenterCropFrame__Frame\">\n<div class=\"CenterCropFrame__Child-Wrap\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure id=\"c73c24fa-5361-4e0a-b1c1-c69012459c35_1\" class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/a5b5d176-6114-4e0d-9dfc-ee9f916902c1\/Maya16.jpg?w=1144.7999696731567&amp;h=2404.7999362945557\" alt=\"A 1986 drawing of stela 12 by Linda Schele\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/span><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<p class=\"Caption__Title\" aria-hidden=\"false\"><span class=\"RichText\" style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">FATE OF THE DEFEATED<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate\" style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span class=\"RichText\">Known as stela 12, the stone on the left and a drawing of the carving on the right, a monolith from the Classic Maya period depicts the humiliation of captives after a battle fought between the city of Piedras Negras (in modern Guatemala) and the city of Pomona\u0301 in spring 792. The victorious ruler of Piedras Negras, K\u2019inich Yat Ahk II, sits high above his defeated prisoners. His nobles wear headdresses and are richly adorned with jewelry. At the ajaw\u2019s feet kneels a captured sajal (noble or governor). Other prisoners appear bound and stripped of their clothes and adornments. The figures are identified; their names are written in glyphs behind them. Some are secondary sajals from Pomona\u0301 and are shown in a position of respect toward the captor, with their right hand on the left shoulder. The style of the stela seems to fit the artistic canons of Pomona\u0301. It may be that it was made by artisans of that city who were captured in the same battle and forced to make this monument. Conflict between Maya city-states increased around the time of the collapse. Piedras Negras might have won the day in 792, but it would be defeated by Yaxchila\u0301n. By 930, Piedras Negras was abandoned.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Political unrest<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Even more of an enigma is the fact that a century and a half later, Maya cities in the northern areas of the Yucatan Peninsula experienced a collapse that seemed to mirror the first. The city of Uxmal, for example, during the 10th century had become the main center of power in the Puuc region. An enormous palace served as both a royal residence and the place where the nobility would hold councils. There was also a ball court, along with a ceremonial complex called the Nunnery Quadrangle. The reliefs, paintings, and inscriptions from this period evoke scenes of war, with warriors decked out in full battle regalia and prisoners being sacrificed.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--below-paragraph InlineElement--content-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/4bc65c33-bf5e-4a89-8ce4-cd62142b8abf\/Maya12.jpg?w=1144.7999696731567&amp;h=730.7999806404114\" alt=\"The ancient ruins in Uxmal, which thrived between the sixth and tenth centuries, are among the finest examples of Maya architecture.

Construction ons everal monumental works was never completed. The immediate cause of this crisis appears to have been the expansion of the neighboring city of Chiche\u0301n Itza\u0301. In parallel, the eastern region of Puuc became increasingly depopulated until it was totally abandoned by the beginning of the 11th century.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Researchers have tried to look beyond simplistic catastrophizing to the myriad complexities and regional idiosyncrasies that might explain the collapse of the Maya civilization. This collapse meant the end of a political and economic system and the abandonment of cities across the southern lowlands. The cities of the northern lowlands also were abandoned 150 years later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Maya civilization never recovered, at least in the form it had once known. However, the descendants of Maya nobles, priests, warriors, and farmers today inhabit the same lands as their ancestors and perpetuate their culture in the still spoken Indigenous languages and in religious rituals. Ancestral farming practices have not been forgotten, nor have traditional styles of clothes and jewelry. Although the Maya collapse seemed to spell the end for the Maya civilization, in fact, Maya culture continues to thrive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/history\/history-magazine\/article\/this-seventh-century-maya-city-was-a-glorious-center-of-power\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>This Maya king transformed Palenque into a glorious center of power<\/i><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"Listicle__Content\" role=\"complementary\" aria-labelledby=\"9abdbb21-dc71-422f-b031-77711d1f7f92-title\">\n<div class=\"Listicle__Content__Title\">\n<h3 id=\"9abdbb21-dc71-422f-b031-77711d1f7f92-title\" class=\"Listicle__Content__Title__Head\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">THE END OF AGUATECA<\/span><\/h3>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/e6895bbe-197a-4bfd-8446-c5a64097ad4a\/Maya13.jpg?w=1144.7999696731567&amp;h=727.1999807357788\" alt=\"An illustration of Aguateca as it may have appeared in the eighth century\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/span><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption Caption--hideEndBug\">\n<p class=\"Caption__Title\" aria-hidden=\"false\"><span class=\"RichText\" style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">THE END OF AGUATECA<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\" style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span class=\"RichText\">An illustration of Aguateca as it may have appeared in the eighth century<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"RichText Listicle__Content__Text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The twin cities of Dos Pilas and Aguateca stood on a high plateau above Lake Petexbatu\u0301n (modern Pete\u0301n, Guatamala).

But a new population analysis of the upper Yucatan Peninsula adds to evidence that the Classic Maya never truly collapsed and disappeared.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cDefinitely, the idea of the collapse of the Maya in the Postclassic era is very debated,\u201d says\u00a0<a class=\"zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE \" href=\"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/scientific-contributions\/Pedro-Delgado-Ku-2087873106\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-testid=\"prism-linkbase\">Pedro Delgado K\u00fa<\/a>, an archaeologist at the Autonomous University of the Yucatan and coauthor of the new study.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK \"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Mayapan vs. Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1<\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In some cases, Postclassic cities rose from the ashes of their predecessors.
