Instead of turning left (north) into the Gimli Ridge parking lot (located in an old cut block), continue up on the rough, little-used road that keeps left. It ascends and turns north to enter a cut block above the cut block for Gimli parking. The road tends to wash out and you may need to park outside the cut block. It gets no maintenance, deteriorates with each year and may not be passable into the cut block.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">(From a 2002 trip to climb Dag, it is mentioned that the above road was followed for 3 km.

I believe this is the same as above)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">After parking, continue along the road into the cut block. A ribboned trail exits from the end of the road. It ascends the south ridge of the West Wolf Ear, crosses into Robertson basin and follows a cairned route that crosses the headwaters of Robertson Creek and ascends the west side of Dag.<br \/>\n2. North Bannock Creek FSR. This road is the access to the Gimli Trail; from the switch back to the Gimli parking area, continue straight ahead and slightly downhill. Follow the well-traveled road as it switches backs twice going downhill. The next intersections were marked with rock cairns. The road ends in a very good turn-around eight kilometres from the Gimli turn.<br \/>\nA route was flagged through the bush and timber to the base of the large avalanche path leading up to the Mt Dag basin. This is a spectacular hiking area with a very short approach\u2014only 1.5km from the road end to the slide path. Late June is the best time to go before the snow leaves the upper slopes and the green succulents erupt. Expect to see bears.<br \/>\nDriving to the very end of the north Bannock Cr FSR is some 32km from the pavement at Slocan City. In 2012, the road was in excellent condition with no impediments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">1. <strong>South Slopes.<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><em>FRA August 1927, exact route unknown.<\/em><\/span><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">A ski ascent of Mount Dag was made by Leon Blumer and Loren Calder in May 1954. Go up the talus slopes of the east ridge (just south of Mulvey Creek) to the south snow slopes to 50 meters from the top, and climb the rest. See Route 7.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">This is probably close to the route of the first ascent, from the south or southeast, from the Little Slocan River or Mulvey Creek.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">2. <strong>South Ridge<\/strong>. From the Mulvey Basin, go to the East Wolf\u2019s Ear-Nott col, traverse the south side of the Nott-Batwing ridge (alplands, trail with cairns) across the headwaters of Robertson Creek to the west side of the south ridge of Dag. Ascend the prominent couloir (loose rock), and then a 5-meter chimney to the south ridge (belay).<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">There is a large, loose boulder at the top of the chimney; the chimney may be difficult to find from above on return. One may rappel. An ascent was recorded in 1983 but this route was certainly done much earlier.<br \/>\nFrom the top of the chimney, it is an easy 1-hour walk up the ridge to the summit.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Round trip, 11 hours from the road access, mostly hiking. The chimney is the one spot where the rope may be necessary. (III,4,s)<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">3. <strong>Traverse Nott, Batwing and Little Dag to Mt. Dag.<\/strong>\u00a0Descend the south ridge of Little Dag, easily gain the Dag-Little Dag col and make a rising traverse right or east on Class 3 &#8211; 4 broken rock. Most parties rappel off Batwing and leave a fixed rope for the return, but the wall at the Batwing-Little Dag col is climbable at about Class 5.5. See Little Dag Route 1, and Route 2 descent.<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">At least one party has done a Tyrolean traverse across the Batwing- Little Dag notch.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">4. <strong>North Buttress<\/strong> (Sweet Judy Blue-Eyes). Ascend up and right from the bergschrund to the large couloir between Dag and Little Dag. Go left on Class 3 and 4 ramps for about 100 meters or so. Class 5 cracks lead to a large ledge system (Smorgasbord Ledge).<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The route is on the right-hand side of the north face, where 2.5 days were spent cleaning and nailing moss-filled cracks. There is also free climbing, mainly in slanting jam cracks and one short, extremely difficult, chimney.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">From the prominent ledge that cuts across the entire face near the top (the White Whale), several difficult leads, including aid, put one on top.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Just below the White Whale ledge, the crack system ends and expanding flakes and loose blocks on the right were encountered. Cliff-hangers used on nubbins on a wall, and then hard free climbing, lead to the ledge.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Take a good selection of 50 pitons, mostly angles up to 7.5 cm, cliff- hangers and hammocks. Several bolts with hangers in place were used for belays only.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Ice, Glacier (VI,5.9,A3,s).<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><em>FA Roy Kligfield, John Roskelly, 4-7\/8\/1971.<\/em><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Another ascent of this route was on August 6-10, 2000, by Craig Clarence, Andrew Magness and George Ortiz, who rated it at Ice, Glacier (VI,5.10, A2+,s). Approach from the north side of Mulvey Basin.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Start from the top of the bergschrund just left of the gully between Dag and Little Dag. Climb up and right (Class 4, easy Class 5) on ramps to just below a car-sized chockstone in a gully. Bypass the chockstone to the right via easy but dirty Class 5 for three pitches, then rappel onto the top of the chockstone from trees above. Fourth-class ledges up and left, above the chockstone, lead to a good bivouac.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Climb three fourth-class pitches to Smorgasbord Ledge. Go up a steep corner at the left end of Smorgasbord Ledge. Mixed free and aid climbing for three 50-meter pitches above Smorgasbord Ledge go to a tension traverse left below a roof; belay at an alcove.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Climb free for two pitches to a ledge. Bypass an ugly chimney system at the left of the ledge by climbing directly above the ledge (A2+), which leads to one bolt and a bolt at the belay.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Continue up a chimney\/flake (Class 5.9+) and wander back left to belay in a crack system. Climb up a steep ramp, just right of the main chimney system, to a good ledge (5.10, 50m).<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Go to the left end of the White Whale ledge via Class 4 climbing.

At the top, head left along flakes to a stance belay below and left of the roof system.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Pitch 12. 5.10. Stem up a corner, then an easier crack system.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Pitch 13. Now above roofs. Class 5.10 up left-sloping corner, then traverse right toward large dihedral. One bolt, delicate slab moves. Finish on good ledge.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Pitch 14. From the right side of the ledge, climb up and right into the corner (5.9+) that leads to below roofs in the dihedral system.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Pitch 15. 5.11. Turn the roof, up the corner\/square-cut stem box to the roof; turn the roof. More corners to the little ledge with a tree. (This pitch is the start of the steep climbing, and doesn\u2019t stop until the top.)<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Pitch 16. 5.10+. Continue up corner\/flake on right face to a bad stance where flake becomes a mini left-facing corner.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Pitch 17. Continue up to the top of the pedestal (5.10+). One is now below <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">a wide off-width crack and corner system and arching roof above. <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Place a large piece and pendulum left to a crack system around the arete. Dirty climbing, french free, wide, layback, jamming, stemming. Would be outstanding if clean. Stance belay.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Pitch 18. 5.10+. Finish at dark at a great ledge, \u201cPercocet Ledge\u201d. Wall rat chews on Jason\u2019s shoes and climbing gear. Bivouac.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Pitch 19. 5.11, A1. Climb the above ledge to clean the crack system left of the main chimney dihedral. Four points of aid were used to get into it. Steep, clean laybacking. Classic stance belay.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Pitch 20. 5.10. Traverse across the mini \u201cThank God Ledge\u201d and into a wide chimney\/off-width crack. Belay on the block and an alcove below the roof.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Pitch 21. Class 5, is nasty. Continue up, and turn the roof, until reaching another ledge below a big chimney.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Pitch 22. Class 5, is nasty. Go up a big chimney through convoluted unpleasant mossy roofs to a \u201cwater cave\u201d. Sam squeezed water from moss.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Pitch 23. Traverse out right onto the face and follow the crack system. A thin Class 5.11 move leads to an off-width crack, the roof. Once through this, climb a Class 5.10 crack to the top. Excellent. <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Some Class 4 climbing remains.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Ice, Glacier (VI,5.11,A1,s).<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><em>Mike Brown, Jason Magness, Sam Price, August 7-9, 2000.<\/em><\/span>\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">6. <strong>Northwest Corner, North Face<\/strong>.
