Bob is chronically unhappy. He is often glum, frequently irritable, and sometimes hopeless, though he has never been clinically depressed. By contrast, Peter is a remarkable happy person. Although he has his low moments and periodic stress, he manages to find joy in his days and is quite content with the way his life is going. To understand why these two men are so different, let me tell you a little bit about them. Both are in their early 40s and doing well in their careers. Bob is a professor of psychology at a prestigious university, who has reasonably bright students, a fair amount of autonomy in his work, and many opportunities for travel. His research program has been successful, garnering attention from all over the U.S. Peter is a deputy city attorney in a small but beautiful city right on the Pacific Ocean. He specializes in landlord-tenant disputes and other civil matters, and his success as a litigator has led to occasional media appearances, in which he is asked to speak about his latest cases. He gets a kick out of doing that.<\/p>\n<p>Both have close-knit families. Bob is married to Allison, and they have 5-year old twin boys. Peter is married to Holly. They started dating in law school, and now have a boy, 6 and a girl, 3. Both men own homes in the suburbs of a major metropolitan area, about half an hour from the city and their jobs.<br \/>\nSo, why is Peter happier than Bob? Was he simply lucky to be born with a sunnier disposition? Or, is he more fortunate with regard to the events and circumstances of his life?<\/p>\n<p>Knowing them, I would be hard-pressed to assert that the life situation of one is clearly superior to the other. On balance, neither seems to have the better job, wife, kids, house, or car. Furthermore, scientific research has shown that prosperity, health, and physical attractiveness are only minimally related to one\u2019s overall happiness. For example, a study by Ed Diener from the University of Illinois demonstrated that the richest Americans \u2013 those earning more than $10 million annually \u2013 report levels of personal happiness only slightly greater than the people who work for them. So, even if Bob had fewer of life\u2019s \u201cgoods,\u201d this shortfall wouldn\u2019t explain his acute unhappiness.<\/p>\n<p>What about genetics? Growing research done with identical and fraternal twins suggests that each person is born with a particular \u201chappiness set point\u201d \u2013 that is, a baseline or potential for happiness to which he or she is bound to return, even after major setbacks or triumphs. The set point for happiness is similar to the set point for weight. Some people are blessed with a \u201cskinny disposition.\u201d Even when they\u2019re not trying, they easily maintain their weight. By contrast, others have to work extraordinarily hard to keep their weight at a desirable level and the moment they slack off even a bit, the pounds creep back on. So, Peter may simply possess a higher set point for happiness, a higher potential for well-being. He doesn\u2019t have to work hard at it \u2013 he just is happy.<\/p>\n<p>So if Peter&#8217;s happiness is due to genetics, what is left for Bob to do? Are we all doomed to obey the directives of our genes? The answer is \u201cno.\u201d Intervention studies to increase and maintain a person\u2019s happiness level over and above his or her set point, suggests that sustainable happiness is attainable regardless of genetics, if one is prepared to do the work. Much like permanent weight loss and fitness, becoming lastingly happier demands making some permanent changes, requiring effort and commitment every day of one\u2019s life. In sum, the set point determines just 50% of happiness, while a mere 10% can be attributed to differences in people\u2019s life circumstances \u2013 that is, whether they are rich or poor, healthy or unhealthy, married or divorced, etc. This leaves a surprising 40% of our capacity for happiness within our power to change. This means that Bob can be a great deal happier and Peter could be even happier too.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Let&#8217;s examine two people. Bob is chronically unhappy.
