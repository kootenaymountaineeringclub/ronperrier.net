The Gallipoli Peninsula is both a NM \u201cSight\u201d and in the \u201cXL\u201d series. Ataturk rose as a military leader during these campaigns.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Allies wanted to capture Istanbul and Turkey for several reasons in WW I. They wanted to eliminate Turkey as an ally to Germany; they wanted an ice-free access to Russia and they wanted another front on which to fight Germany and Austro-Hungary. The only way to capture Istanbul was via the Dardanelles.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">This was a 9-month battle fought between the British-led forces (including many Commonwealth countries, especially New Zealanders and Australians) and the Ottoman Empire allied with Germany in WW I. The first offence occurred between the British Navy and the land-based defence of the Ottomans on both sides of the Dardanelles on March 18, 2015. The second attack started on April 25 when the Allies attacked via land on the north shore of the Gallipoli Peninsula. The third major offensive started on August 8 with another land attack. The fourth phase was the evacuation of the peninsula in December 2015.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In the nine months from March to December 1915, the death tolls were: 34,072 British, 9,798 French, 8,709 Australian, 2,721 New Zealanders, 1,358 Indians, 49 Newfoundlanders, and 56,643 Ottoman Empire soldiers died.

In 1461-2, two fortresses were built on either side of the Dardanelles at the narrowest part \u2013 Kilitbehir on the European side and Kale-e Sultanye on the Asian side both fortified with cannons. Made ineffective by pirates and the 1650-57 Venetian attacks, 2 more fortresses were built in 1660. All were updated in the 1800\u2019s. The British managed to get through due to strong winds in 1807 and the forts were reinforced again. In 1907, the telegraph improved defences through better communication and 35 land batteries and ramparts were added.

The Troy citizens brought the horse into the town. Waiting until dark, the Greek warriors opened the gates and set Troy on fire.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">This model horse was used in the 2004 Warner Bros production starring Brad Pitt as Achilles and has been on display in Canakkale since September 2004.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Canakkale City Museum.<\/strong> The usual city museum but this one focuses more on the battle of 1915 and the fortresses lining the shore. 10 TL<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Military Marine Museum and Gelibolu Fortress<\/strong>, Canakkale.

On August 6, the British Navy artillery pounded Ottoman trenches (where Lone Pine is). The attack was intended to divert Ottoman forces from the major offensive at Sari Bay farther north. It was a brutal battle involving hand-to-hand combat in the trenches with revolvers, rifles and bayonets. 2000 Australians and 7000 Ottomans died in the next 7 months, but Lone Pine was held until the evacuation in December. 7 Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The one-way road snakes along the ridgeline, the control of which was the objective of the land-based attack.
