Filipinos have done both. The bomb-cratered moonscape I saw at Danajon Bank is the end result of one approach: destructive overfishing of reef ecosystems. But at Dauin, a municipality on Negros island, I saw a different legacy, one of reef protection that has eased pressure on marine life and sustained a living for communities on the coast.<\/p>\n<p>The approach was pioneered by Angel Alcala, a Filipino biologist who has championed the creation of small, community-managed marine protected areas (MPAs). Often the prime reason for creating these sanctuaries is to preserve biodiversity, but for Alcala the main focus is to benefit fisheries. \u201cFilipino people are fish-eaters,\u201d Alcala tells me when I meet him at the research center he leads at Silliman University, just north of Dauin. \u201cTo maintain that, there need to be marine reserves.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Alcala started in the early 1970s with two prototype reserves: one near an island that was inhabited (Apo, off the coast of Dauin) and one near an island that was not (Sumilon, near Cebu).

In 10 years, fish biomass for some species in the sanctuaries\u2014namely groupers, snappers, and jacks\u2014increased at least sixfold. As the density of fish inside the reserves increased, fishers reaped the benefit through the phenomenon of spillover: Fish \u201cspill over\u201d reserve boundaries into waters where they can be legally caught. The idea that no-take sanctuaries could replenish fish stocks on nearby exploited reefs offered a bright speck of hope in an otherwise dismal outlook for coastal fishers.<\/p>\n<p>Apo Island\u2019s success caught the attention of Rodrigo Alanano, who was elected Dauin\u2019s mayor in 2001. Alanano decided to increase the number of marine protected areas along the Dauin coastline.

Most of Dauin\u2019s MPAs are referred to by the names of fish species that serve as their celebrity attractions: Nemo\/Clown Fish MPA, Mandarin MPA, Frog Fish MPA, Ghost Pipe and Sea Horse MPA.<\/p>\n<p>As tourism has flourished, fishers have seen opportunities to switch from catching fish to providing services. In Oslob, a town on the coast of Cebu, few members of the fishers association fish anymore. They earn a handsome living enabling tourists to swim with whale sharks. Near Puerto Galera, on the island of Mindoro, I watched snorkelers being towed out to see giant clams by fishers in small outrigger canoes powered by chain saw and lawn mower engines.<\/p>\n<p>In Dauin, several fishers have retrained as dive masters. Amado A. Alar II runs Bongo Bongo Divers, down a side road from a Chooks To Go fried-chicken house. He tells me that when Dauin\u2019s MPAs were being established, some fishers refused to accept the loss of their fishing grounds.

Philippine law stipulates that 15 percent of coastal municipal waters must be protected within no-take MPAs. There are now more than 1,600 of them throughout the country. Unfortunately, most are tiny and not well managed\u2014mere \u201cpaper parks.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Only 3 percent of the country\u2019s coral reefs are protected, Alcala says, explaining, \u201cWe need 20 to 30 percent. It\u2019s a question of empowering local communities.\u201d And giving them the resources to protect the investment they have made. Even sanctuaries that are properly cared for by their communities are susceptible to poaching. The COVID-19 pandemic, which has devastated tourism, also has made marine protections precarious. Even local people, grasping the blade of desperation, have entered protected areas to feed their families.<\/p>\n<p><b>But poaching by outsiders\u00a0<\/b>is a greater threat, and a growing problem across the Philippines. With fast boats and scuba gear, professional poachers can strip a sanctuary in a night, Darrell Pasco tells me. Pasco works in coastal resource management for the island of Siquijor, a dozen miles from Dauin. One of Siquijor\u2019s MPAs was poached four times in a single year. The intruders come at night, during fiestas, or at times of bad weather, when there are fewer eyes watching, he says. They carry weapons. How can Siquijor\u2019s bantay dagat, who earn a pittance, oppose such people?<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--below-paragraph InlineElement--browser-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\" data-bumper-index=\"25\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/a511d5f4-f37a-4bde-a145-5e81d713ee13\/MM8431_160618_12056.jpg?w=2520&amp;h=1890\" alt=\"Picture of a silhouetted diver framed by the large wreck of the Belle Rose cement carrier.\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">The\u00a0<i>Belle Rose,<\/i>\u00a0a cement carrier, hit the reef off Malapascua Island, narrowly missing a spot popular with divers where typically hard-to-find thresher sharks are cleaned by wrasses.

As high-value fish such as grouper and snapper have become scarce, species that were formerly considered trash fish have become standard fare. Damselfish\u2014darting cobalt-blue beauties with mango dipped tails\u2014were never eaten, Pasco says. Now they sell for a premium in the market, alongside such delicacies as sea anemones cooked in coconut milk, spider conchs, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, and seaweeds that look like clusters of green pearls.<\/p>\n<p>I saw the struggle that Siquijor\u2019s fishers face when I slipped into the silky sea one morning to watch a group of men haul up a fish trap, or\u00a0<i>bubu<\/i>, from the seabed about 250 feet below us. Slowly it rose, a 15-foot-long woven basket spacious enough that I could have swum pirouettes inside it. The pattern of its bamboo weave was intricate, the work of skilled hands. As seven men heaved the bubu onto the deck of their\u00a0<i>banca<\/i>\u2014the traditional double-outrigger boat of the Philippines\u2014I peered inside, looking for the harvest that should have been there, for the baited trap had lain on the seabed for a week.

Empty. I winced as small jellyfish and broken arms of sea anemones fell from the trap and stung my skin. And I winced for the dashed expectations of the men and their families. Bubu fishers may earn as little as a dollar per trap per week. Their households are typically on the poverty line or below it, as is 60 percent of the country\u2019s coastal population.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--browser-width InlineElement--desktop ImageGroup__Wrapper\" aria-label=\"Image Pair\" data-bumper-index=\"27\">\n<div class=\"ImageGroup__Images\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure id=\"4505dca0-2819-4699-9a15-52eb6ed5ef38_0\" class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/f9e1edff-7a02-42b1-87e8-b517132dd25f\/MM8431_160618_5262.jpg?w=2520&amp;h=1678\" alt=\"Picture of the hull of the Belle Rose where deep scratches are seen from where the boat ran aground in the coral reef.\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure id=\"4505dca0-2819-4699-9a15-52eb6ed5ef38_1\" class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/dbbb05c6-0b78-4e50-b312-bc3d01cf7909\/MM8431_160610_10661.jpg?w=2520&amp;h=1678\" alt=\"Picture of a thresher shark\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<div class=\"Image__Copyright\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption Caption--hideEndBug\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\"><strong>Left<\/strong>: The\u00a0<i>Belle Rose<\/i>\u00a0damaged almost 1,600 feet of the coral reef at Monad Shoal when it ran aground, but it missed a well-known thresher shark cleaning station that attracts tourists to Malapascua Island.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\"><strong>Right<\/strong>: Around 5 a.m., thresher sharks arrive at the cleaning station and make slow passes to allow wrasses to nibble off parasites and dead skin.

Another way of relieving the demand on reef ecosystems is for fishers to take up alternative livelihoods such as marine farming. At a remote atoll in the Sulu Sea I met families living on bamboo platforms in reef lagoons, drying seaweed. The algae they farm produce carrageenan, a polysaccharide used as a stabilizer in medicines, toothpaste, pill capsules, cosmetics, and other products. Thousands of Filipino families have become seaweed ranchers.<\/p>\n<p>In the islands of the Calamian Group, at the northern tip of Palawan, people are learning how to ranch sea cucumbers. I helped release dozens of juveniles the size of my little finger from net cages so they could free-range across warm estuarine flats. In two months they will reach the size of fat sausages. When dried, sea cucumbers sell for more than $30 a pound, 10 times more than grouper.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--below-paragraph InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\" data-bumper-index=\"29\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/0c89e918-a1b5-470a-a069-52cf24dba895\/MM8431_160529_8715.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=1704\" alt=\"Picture of a clownfish nestled into a lone anemone.\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">A lone anemone and a false clown anemonefish are some of the first colonizers after a typhoon damaged the coral reef in the Sumilon Island Marine Reserve.<br id=\"isPasted\" \/><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<p><b>There is abundant evidence<\/b>\u00a0that reefs regenerate when human pressure is removed.
