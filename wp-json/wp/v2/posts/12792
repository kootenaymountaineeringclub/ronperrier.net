After the secession of\u00a0South Sudan\u00a0from\u00a0Sudan, Algeria became the largest country in Africa. Algerian tourism is best known for its\u00a0ancient ruins\u2014principally Phoenician, Roman, and Byzantine eras &#8211; Timgad\u00a0near\u00a0Batna,\u00a0Hippo Regius at Annaba, Djemila at Setif, Calama at Guelma, and ruins from all three empires at\u00a0Tipasa.<br \/>\nAlgeria\u2019s greatest tourist possibilities lie in the\u00a0Sahara &#8211; the crown jewel is the centre of Mozabite culture in the\u00a0M\u2019zab Valley. The five interconnected cities are a breathtaking architectural playground evocative of modern cubist and surrealist art.<br \/>\nAlso see the harsh, rugged\u00a0Saharan Atlas\u00a0mountains, the endless desert and Hoggar Mountains around the country\u2019s desert capital of\u00a0Tamanrasset, the huge dune field of the Grand Erg Oriental at\u00a0El-Oued, and the ancient rock carvings of\u00a0Djelfa\u00a0and the Saharan National Park of\u00a0Tassili N\u2019Ajjer.<br \/>\nOf Algeria\u2019s\u00a0major cities, there is generally little of interest to see. Its modern culture is stifled by conflict, abysmal government, Islamic heritage, and colonial legacy. Constantine\u00a0is the one major city that deserves a spot on your itinerary. In the north, it is 1200 km between Annaba and Oran. Get on cable cars in Constantine, Algiers, Annaba, Oran, and Tlemcen) for breath-taking views.<br \/>\nThe Mediterranean\u00a0beaches\u00a0in Algeria are woefully underdeveloped, due to poor security scaring off almost all tourists. Oran on the\u00a0Turquoise Coast,\u00a0Annaba, and particularly\u00a0Skikda\u00a0and\u00a0Ghazaouet\u00a0all have nice beaches. Near Algiers, visit Sidi Fredj.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Capital<\/strong>: Algiers<br \/>\n<strong>Population:\u00a0<\/strong>44,700,000\u00a0(32nd)<strong><br \/>\nEthnic groups.<\/strong>\u00a0<span class=\"nowrap\">Arab-Berber\u00a099%<br \/>\n<strong>Language. <\/strong>Official Arabic\u00a0and Tamazight (Berber language mainly rural).<br \/>\nFrench, the colonial language, is still spoken widely.

Therefore bring all the money you will need as cash, preferably euros. Usually, large bills (100 and 50) get the best exchange rate.<br \/>\nTherefore, even if the ATMs or credit cards worked, it would be very foolish to use them as you immediately lose a significant amount of money. Just change a few dollars at the airport then the rest at the black market.

Cleanliness.<\/strong> After all the garbage in our previous African countries, Algeria was exceptionally clean. Many of the colonial French buildings are attractive and freshly painted.<br \/>\n<strong>2. Police escorts.<\/strong> At every airport, one must register with the police, and then be escorted by them where ever you go.<br \/>\nSupposedly for our security, we were escorted by police outside Constantine to Timgad. At every town and district boundary, the escorts were changed and we had 14 different escorts. Often we had to wait. Our driver was great as he drove very aggressively, usually tailgating the police. Sometimes they drove slowly but sometimes turned on their flashers and sirens giving us fast driving. They passed with oncoming cars and on hills. It was all very crazy and just one example of bureaucracy gone mad.<br \/>\nWe also had escorts in Oran and from there to Tlemcen (8 different cars0<br \/>\n<strong>3. Traveling independently in Algeria.<\/strong> When I originally wanted to come here, my plan was to hire a car and drive around the north. Unless you can avoid being registered by the police, this may be impossible. The police will prevent you from going most places.<\/p>\n<div class=\"j83agx80\" role=\"none\">\n<div class=\"j83agx80 buofh1pr g5gj957u hpfvmrgz\" role=\"none\" data-testid=\"message-container\">\n<div class=\"ns4p8fja j83agx80 cbu4d94t a6sixzi8 bkfpd7mw nred35xi a1xu1aao\" role=\"none\">\n<div class=\"j83agx80 k4urcfbm\" role=\"none\">\n<div class=\"ll8tlv6m j83agx80 cbu4d94t d2edcug0 l9j0dhe7\">\n<div class=\"j83agx80 k4urcfbm\" role=\"none\">\n<div class=\"cxgpxx05 d1544ag0 sj5x9vvc tw6a2znq l9j0dhe7 ni8dbmo4 stjgntxs e72ty7fz qlfml3jp inkptoze qmr60zad jm1wdb64 qv66sw1b ljqsnud1 odn2s2vf tkr6xdv7\" role=\"none\" data-testid=\"solid-message-bubble\">\n<div class=\"rq0escxv l9j0dhe7 du4w35lb __fb-light-mode\" role=\"none\">\n<div class=\"hzawbc8m ii04i59q jq4qci2q g9io39s2 oo9gr5id\" dir=\"auto\" role=\"none\">\n<p><strong>Itinerary <\/strong>summary Oct 22-Nov 3, 2022<br \/>\n<strong style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Day 0 Sat 10\/22<\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"> @ 23:15-03:50+1 from NKC-ALG @ Air Algerie (1W Direct 3.5hr) C$385 10\/23 @ 03:50.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Day 1 Sun 10\/23<\/strong>\u00a0<\/span>D1 arrive ALG (arrive at 4 am from NKC), transfer to hotel and rest.

The most noticeable thing was how clean it was\u2014there was no garbage anywhere. The buildings are well maintained and painted white, hence the moniker &#8220;the White City.&#8221; The French colonial buildings are gorgeous and all newly painted.<br \/>\n<\/em>Driving downtown had heavy slow traffic. A massive park lines kilometres of the shore.<br \/>\nLocated on the Mediterranean, it was colonized as part of France from the mid-1800s to 1962. Algeria was ravaged by a brutal civil war in the 1990s, where over 100,000 perished. Algiers, the famed White City, is much less touristic than one might expect, given its central role in the country\u2019s economic, political, and cultural life. But all visitors will pass through anyway, so the Casbah\u2014Algiers\u2019 historic seventeenth-century centre &#8211; is certainly worth a visit.<br \/>\nToday is safe with few western tourists.<br \/>\n<strong>Kasbah of Algiers.<\/strong> The historic hillside neighbourhood is crammed with 80,000 people, local markets, artisans, and mosques.

Called Cuicul, the city was built 900 metres above sea level during the 1st century AD as a Roman military garrison.<br \/>\nThe exceptionally well-preserved ruins surround the forum at its center &#8211; the square with a majestic arch &#8211; and two main streets, the\u00a0Cardo Maximus\u00a0and the\u00a0Decumanus Maximus. The city was initially populated by a colony of Roman soldiers and eventually grew to become a large trading market with an agricultural base (cereals, olive trees).<br \/>\nIn the 3rd century, Cuicul&#8217;s new forum was built surrounded by larger and more impressive edifices and a theatre outside the town walls.<br \/>\nChristianity became very popular in the 4th century and a basilica and baptistry were added. The city was slowly abandoned after the fall of the Roman Empire around the 5th century and 6th century. There were some improvements under Emperor Justinian I, with wall reinforcements.<br \/>\nMuslims later dominated the region but did not reoccupy the site of Cuicul, which they renamed Dj\u00e9mila (&#8220;beautiful&#8221; in Arabic).<br \/>\n<\/span>Start at the spectacular museum with great artifacts and walls covered with wonderful mosaics.

World Heritage Site 2002. This has many tourists as it is an easy day trip from Algiers.<br \/>\nInitially, a small ancient Punic trading post was turned into a military colony by the emperor Claudius for the conquest of the kingdoms of Mauretania, it had a population of 20,000 in the fourth century. Under Roman rule, the city acquired greater commercial and military importance because of its harbour and its central position on the system of Roman coastal roads in North Africa. A wall of 2,300 metres was built around the city for defence against nomadic tribes, and Roman public buildings and districts of houses were constructed within the enclosure.<br \/>\nAll that remains are ruins of three churches \u2014 the Great Basilica and the Basilica Alexander on the western hill, and the Basilica of St Salsa on the eastern hill, two cemeteries, the baths, theatre, amphitheatre (the best preserved and largest structure at 100 m in length, used for gladiator fights) and nymphaeum. The line of the ramparts can be distinctly traced and at the foot of the eastern hill the remains of the ancient harbour.<br \/>\nThe basilicas are surrounded by cemeteries, which are full of coffins, all of stone and covered with damaged mosaics.<br \/>\n<strong>Christianity.<\/strong> Algeria became an important centre of Christianity in the 3rd century. In the third century, Christianity was worshipped by all the Romanised Berbers and Roman colonists of Tipasa. From this period comes the oldest Christian epitaph in Roman Africa dated October 17, 237 AD. In Tipasa were built the biggest basilicas of actual Algeria: the Alexander Basilica and the Basilica of Saint Salsa.<br \/>\nAbout 372 Tipasa withstood an assault by Firmus, the leader of a Berber rebellion that had overrun the nearby cities of Caesarea (modern Cherchell) and Icosium (modern Algiers). Tipasa then served as the base for the Roman counter-campaign. However, Tipasa\u2019s fortifications did not prevent the city from being conquered by the Vandals in about 429, bringing to an end the prosperity that the city had enjoyed during the Roman period. In 484, during the persecution of the Catholic church by the Vandal king Huneric, the Catholic bishop of Tipasa was expelled and replaced with an Arian bishop\u2014prompting many to flee to Spain. In the ensuing decades, the city fell into ruin.<br \/>\nMost of the inhabitants continued to be non-Christian until, according to the legend, Salsa, a Christian maiden, threw the head of their serpent idol into the sea and the enraged populace stoned her to death. The body, miraculously recovered from the sea, was buried, on the hill above the harbour, in a small chapel which gave place subsequently to the stately basilica. Salsa&#8217;s martyrdom took place in the 4th century.<br \/>\n<strong>Decline.<\/strong> Tipasa was partially destroyed by the Vandals in 430 but was rebuilt by the Byzantines one century later. Tipasa revived for a brief time during the Byzantine occupation in the 6th century but was given the Arabic language name, Tefassed when Arabs arrived there. The term translated means badly damaged.<br \/>\nAt the end of the seventh century, the city was destroyed by the Arabs and reduced to ruins. Modern city In 1857 settled again the area, with the creation of the city of Tipaza which now has nearly 30,000 inhabitants. The town and its surroundings is home to the largest Berber-speaking group of western Algeria, the Chenoua people.<br \/>\nTiipasa was not an interesting site as virtually everything was low stone walls and poor sandstone columns. Its location on the water was the highlight.<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><br \/>\n<strong>CHERCHELL<\/strong> (90 km \/ 1hr from Algiers).<br \/>\n<strong>Archaeological Public Museum of Cherhell.<\/strong> Many marble statues, virtually none intact.

Walls formed a citadel of each village.\u00a0Center of date production.<br \/>\nVery conservative and traditional, it is physically isolated in the desert and has managed to maintain its cultures and mores.\u00a0 When entering each of the five walled villages, visitors are required to take a local guide in addition to your regular guide.\u00a0\u00a0They do not want you to explore independently. A sign was posted in each village dictating the rules: no shorts, no smoking, and depart before sunset, and no pictures of people.\u00a0 M\u2019Zab Valley is not focused on mass tourism.

Only Beni Isguen still has walls surrounding it. Large residential areas have grown up around each central village.<br \/>\nConstruction is all about light and ventilation.

It is inhabited by the\u00a0Kel Ajjer\u00a0Tuareg people. The region of Djanet has been inhabited since\u00a0Neolithic\u00a0times. There were periods of ten thousand years at a time when the area was not desert. The flora and fauna were luxuriant as is seen in the numerous rock paintings of\u00a0Tassili n&#8217;Ajjer\u00a0around Djanet. Populations of hunter-gatherers lived there.<br \/>\nDjanet was founded in the Middle Ages by the\u00a0Tuareg.<br \/>\nDjanet, and the nearby towns of\u00a0Azelouaz,\u00a0El Mihan,\u00a0Adjahil\u00a0and\u00a0Eferi, lie in a valley carved by the intermittent river (<i>wadi<\/i>) Oued Idjeriou through the southwest edge of the\u00a0Tassili n&#8217;Ajjer\u00a0mountain range and east of the\u00a0Erg Admer\u00a0sand dunes. The\u00a0Tadrart Rouge\u00a0is located to the southeast and is a southern prolongation of the Libyan\u00a0Tadrart Acacus.<br \/>\nDue to the somewhat cooler air, higher humidity and somewhat higher rainfall in these areas, the nearby mountains support a greater amount and variety of wildlife than lower-lying areas in the Sahara. Djanet altitude is 1,035 metres, and mountains to the east and north as high as 1,905 metres (6,250 ft)<br \/>\n<span id=\"cite_ref-Map_3-0\" class=\"reference\" style=\"line-height: 1; font-size: 10px; height: 0px; position: relative; vertical-align: baseline; bottom: 1ex;\"><\/span>Djanet has a\u00a0hot desert climate\u00a0with very hot summers and mild winters.

Neither spoke English and I relied on Google Translate.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>I find it amazing how skilled Ahmed was in finding all the following pictographs and petroglyph panels. We must have seen 20 over the next three days. He doesn&#8217;t use GPS, just his memory. I asked Ahmed how many trips he had made down here. He said many, possibly a thousand!! He had lost track.<br \/>\nI blew it by not downloading offline maps so have none of our camp or lunch spots or any of the rock painting sites marked. I didn&#8217;t have a clue where we were &#8211; just south of Djanet often near the Libyan border.<br \/>\nThe scene initially is eroded ridges and low mountains (sometimes with eroded cliffs) and a lot of sand. The rock mostly disappeared and we crossed a rocky desert. A remote intersection had a sign Libya to the left, and Niger to the right. We continued south.<br \/>\nWe had lunch in an unattractive wadi with thin plates of sedimentary rock. EC has no data connection and is lost. She doesn&#8217;t read so paces endlessly up and down the wadi. She is bored stiff and hates it so far as there is a lot of driving.<br \/>\nWe entered a big valley with high sandstone domes, cliffs, and buttes rather reminiscent of Utah\/Arizona.<br \/>\nThe <strong>Ajajar rock paintings<\/strong> are in three main sites in overhangs. Painted in red ochre, they are small, beautiful, finely executed paintings with great detail.<br \/>\n\u2022 A giraffe,<br \/>\n\u2022 Large cattle-like animals with horns and men.<br \/>\n\u2022 One rock we stopped at had bas-relief fossils of a small plant.<br \/>\nAhmed hacked off wood from a fallen tree for a long time. He always lights a fire for tea. Like all northern Africans, tea is an art form. As they use leaves, there is a long, elaborate decanting process pouring the tea in long streams between two pots to catch the leaf debris in the foam which is discarded. They always use a lot of sugar, more mixing and it is too sweet.<br \/>\nOut in the middle of nowhere, we passed a police checkpoint, six guys stranded out here must be no fun.<br \/>\nWe drove a long way down the winding valley and saw at least 21 other SUVs and Hilux&#8217;s here. Nobody stopped so I have no idea who the tourists were.<br \/>\nON We eventually camped in a remote side canyon under a huge cliff. Mohammed always makes too much food, especially as I eat little. Anything not eaten is discarded. Ahmed sang and played a &#8220;flute&#8221; made of a copper pipe and holes drilled in it. He plugged the end with a cloth for a better sound. Ahmed keeps up a continuous banter in Taureg as we drive. Mohammed just grunts along.<br \/>\nEC slept in a tent and missed the wonderful skies full of stars in this dark-sky place. I saw at least 10 meteorites in ten minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Some date back up to 12,000 years, and provide unique insights into the environmental, social, cultural and economic changes in the country across a period of 10,000 or more years. The area is particularly famous for its Round Head paintings,<br \/>\nThe earliest pieces of rock art are engraved images reflecting a past vibrant fertile environment teeming with life and include elephants, rhinoceroses, hippopotami and fish as well as numerous predators, giraffes, and plains animals such as antelope and gazelle. When human figures are depicted in this period they are very small in stature and hold throwing sticks or axes. More than simply hunting scenes, they are likely to reflect people\u2019s place within their environment and their relationship with it.<br \/>\nThe area is especially famous for its Round Head paintings. Thought to be up to 9,000 years old, they are depictions of figures with round, featureless heads and formless bodies, often appearing to be \u2018floating\u2019. The majority of animal depictions are mouflon (wild mountain sheep) and antelope, but they are represented only in static positions and not as part of a hunting scene.<br \/>\nThe subsequent Pastoral Period, from around 7,500-4,000 years ago, portrays a very different world to the preceding ethereal Round Head period and coincides with the transition from a temperate Sahara towards aridification. Images are stylistically varied, which may attest to the movement of different cultural groups. Depictions now include domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep, goats and dogs; scenes portray herders, men hunting with bows, and representations of camp life with women and children \u2013 in essence, scenes that reference more settled communities.<br \/>\nThe last defined period stylistically is characterized by the depiction of camels, representing an alternative method of negotiating this arid and harsh landscape. Camels can travel for days without water and were used extensively in caravans transporting trade goods and salt. Depictions in this period continue to include domestic animals and armed figures.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"_M6xru _G1lKs\" href=\"https:\/\/static8.depositphotos.com\/1003352\/891\/i\/950\/depositphotos_8914389-stock-photo-rock-paintings-of-tassili-najjer.jpg\" data-qa=\"ImageThumb\"><picture class=\"_bx31R _AwGDk _NeRXj\" data-qa=\"VPicture\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"_bx31R _r7_Ho\" title=\"Download - Famous prehistoric rock paintings of Tassili N'Ajjer, Algeria \u2014 Stock Image\" src=\"https:\/\/static8.depositphotos.com\/1003352\/891\/i\/950\/depositphotos_8914389-stock-photo-rock-paintings-of-tassili-najjer.jpg\" alt=\"Rock paintings of Tassili N'Ajjer, Algeria \u2014 Stock Photo, Image\" width=\"619\" height=\"413\" \/><\/picture><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Day 9 Mon 31\/10<\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><br \/>\nAhmed said BF was an 8.

The Saoura Valley was a major Transharian caravan route that joined Gao in Malian territory after crossing Tanezrouft.

There are vast fortified houses with corner towers and fortified attics. 600 of the original 995 foggaras still irrigate the palm groves.\u00a0\u00a0200 km of galleries.<br \/>\nTimimoun: the red oasis, is one of the most beautiful oases of the Sahara. Red predominates in clay and the colour of sand. The old ksar, enclosed in its walls has a maze of its alleys. Berber-speaking z\u00e9n\u00e8tes. The city of Timimoun dominates a vast salt lake, the sebkha on the edge of which are built dozens of ksours (Messin, El Gasba, Tlalit\u2026) and whose casbahs cling to the rocky escarpments. The sebkha that we cross to reach the large palm grove of Ouled Sa\u00efd is a salt lake 75 km long.<br \/>\nThe oases of Tidikelt have 300,000 palm trees organized into 28 oases and irrigated from 125 foggaras. 10 km to the east is a deposit of petrified wood (old silicified trees whose trunks reach a diameter of 1m. These vestiges date back to the secondary era).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Oued souf<\/strong> (30\/12\/2002) Wadi souf\u00a0 is a set of unique oasis in full erg. The palm trees are planted directly above the tablecloth at the bottom of vast funnels dug in the sand.\u00a0Secondary crops are grown on the edge of the funnels and irrigated by outrigger wells.\u00a0This type of oasis is not based on a geomorphological structure or an apparent hydrographic system but is\u00a0a completely artificial creation. The maintenance work can never be interrupted due to the continuous wind and sand.<br \/>\nSouf has sand roses, fennec foxes and carpets of high wool or camel hair.\u00a015 km west of El Oued: the oasis of Ourmes.<br \/>\nEl oued: the city of a thousand domes, capital of the Souf.\u00a0The architecture here differs from that of other Saharan cities.\u00a0Instead of terraces, domes crown the houses.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hoggar National Park<\/strong> &#8211;\u00a0<strong>The Royal Mausoleums of Numidia, Mauritania and Pre-Islamic Funerary Monuments<\/strong> (17\/01\/2012).
