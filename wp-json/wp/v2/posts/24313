As it has done every 17 years since, Brood XIV died off just six or so weeks after it emerged, but not before laying billions of eggs that would make their appearance as adults another 17 years later\u2014and so on down the centuries. In late April of this year, the brood began making its second 21st century appearance, when the first of the invaders appeared in Tennessee and North Carolina, preparatory to a 15-state sweep that will also include Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Virginia\u2014before they vanish again in mid- to late-June.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mb-8\">\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-6 focus-visible:outline focus-visible:outline-black-coffee focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2 focus-visible:shadow-focus-color text-left\">There\u2019s no overstating just how many of the bugs there will be. On average, about 1.5 million cicadas occupy every acre of tree-covered land during an emergence, according to Gene Kritsky, professor emeritus of biology at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati, Ohio, and author of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Pilgrims-Promise-Emergence-Periodical-Cicada\/dp\/B0DTYZXG37\"><em>The Pilgrims\u2019 Promise: The 2025 Emergence of the Periodical Cicada Brood XIV<\/em><\/a>.

Here\u2019s what else you need to know about the upcoming visitation.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"text-mobile-h3 lg:text-h3 font-editorial text-black-coffee text-left mb-6\">Brood XIV is not alone<\/h2>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-0 focus-visible:outline focus-visible:outline-black-coffee focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2 focus-visible:shadow-focus-color text-left\">If you\u2019re a cicada fancier, you could be forgiven for being confused about the insects\u2019 17-year cycle, because cicadas can appear at much shorter intervals\u2014even annually. That\u2019s because there are actually 15 different broods at large, 12 of them observing a 17-year schedule and three making their appearance every 13 years\u2014and the broods\u2019 emergences are staggered. It was in 1902 that entomologist\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/cicadas.uconn.edu\/broods\/\">Charles Marlatt developed<\/a>\u00a0the nomenclature scheme used to identify different appearances, with the 17-year cicada variety designated Broods I through XVII, and their 13-year cousins Broods XVIII through XXX.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mb-8\">\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-6 focus-visible:outline focus-visible:outline-black-coffee focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2 focus-visible:shadow-focus-color text-left\">Distinguishing one 17- or 13-year brood from another is not hard, because each one has a different geographical footprint, with little overlap among them. \u201cThey don\u2019t occur uniformly over all parts [of the U.S.],\u201d says Kritsky. \u201cThey do occur in certain areas, in certain pockets.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-0 focus-visible:outline focus-visible:outline-black-coffee focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2 focus-visible:shadow-focus-color text-left\">Entomologists had another way too to determine that each brood is unique to its own turf. During the adults\u2019 six weeks of life, the females will make small cuts in the ends of tree branches and deposit their eggs there. The eggs incubate for six to 10 weeks before hatching into nymphs, which fall to the ground, burrow beneath the surface, and clamp their mouth parts onto a rootlet, from which they will feed for their long subterranean stay. When they emerge, they evacuate the underground\u00a0<em>en masse<\/em>.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mb-8\">\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-6 focus-visible:outline focus-visible:outline-black-coffee focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2 focus-visible:shadow-focus-color text-left\">\u201cWhen you go into an area where they\u2019re emerging and you dig into the ground, you don\u2019t find anything there. They\u2019re all out,\u201d says John Cooley, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Connecticut, Hartford. \u201cIf you go back to that same spot in a year, when they\u2019re not emerging, and you dig, you\u2019re going to find them underground.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"text-mobile-h3 lg:text-h3 font-editorial text-black-coffee text-left mb-6\">Are cicadas pests?<\/h2>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-0 focus-visible:outline focus-visible:outline-black-coffee focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2 focus-visible:shadow-focus-color text-left\">That depends on your tolerance for the sight and sound of zillions of winged bugs appearing at once, settling in trees, getting crunched underfoot, and often splooching against your windshield. But apart from that\u2014not really.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mb-8\">\n<figure>\n<div class=\"relative w-full\"><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mb-8\">\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-6 focus-visible:outline focus-visible:outline-black-coffee focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2 focus-visible:shadow-focus-color text-left\">\u201cThey don\u2019t swarm,\u201d says Kritsky. \u201cThat\u2019s a misuse of the word. Swarms are usually directed, coordinated movements of individual [insects] in a particular area. They\u2019re lousy flyers. They\u2019re flying around, but they\u2019re really not doing much, just going from tree to tree. They don\u2019t carry disease. They don\u2019t bite. They won\u2019t carry away your pets.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-6 focus-visible:outline focus-visible:outline-black-coffee focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2 focus-visible:shadow-focus-color text-left\">\u201cIn pediatric journals you read about people being harmed by cicadas,\u201d says Cooley. \u201cBut it was always something stupid, like riding down the road on a motorcycle without a helmet and one hits them in the eye.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-0 focus-visible:outline focus-visible:outline-black-coffee focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2 focus-visible:shadow-focus-color text-left\">Cicadas also don\u2019t attack crops or gardens or plants\u2014partly because their mouths are adapted only for sucking, not biting or chewing. To the extent that they do any harm to vegetation, it\u2019s mostly to young trees, whose branches may weaken and break due to the cuts the females make to deposit their eggs. If you have young trees or maturing orchards, both Kritsky and Cooley say, it pays to cover them with avian netting\u2014which is used as protection against birds and can be found in hardware and garden stores.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mb-8\">\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-6 focus-visible:outline focus-visible:outline-black-coffee focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2 focus-visible:shadow-focus-color text-left\">Whatever you do, don\u2019t even think about using pesticides to rid your yard or field of cicadas. \u201cYou can\u2019t spray enough insecticide to deal with this,\u201d says Cooley. \u201cAnd if you try to spray that much, you\u2019re going to kill everything in sight.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"text-mobile-h3 lg:text-h3 font-editorial text-black-coffee text-left mb-6\">So if they don\u2019t do any harm, do they do any good?<\/h2>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-0 focus-visible:outline focus-visible:outline-black-coffee focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2 focus-visible:shadow-focus-color text-left\">Yes. A lot, actually. Cicadas benefit the environment in a number of ways. First, in emerging from the ground they leave open tunnels about as big around as a pinky, which can persist until December. That aerates the soil and provides entry points for rainwater, which nourishes tree roots. They also serve as a ready food source for birds and other predators such as cats, dogs, chipmunks, and squirrels. The bugs are harmless if eaten by pets, though Cooley warns that dogs\u2014being dogs\u2014may gorge on them beyond what\u2019s best for them, with all that roughage resulting in a constipated canine. Either way, most cicada predators enjoy the feast.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mb-8\">\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-0 focus-visible:outline focus-visible:outline-black-coffee focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2 focus-visible:shadow-focus-color text-left\">\u201cThe pulse of nutrition allows for more offspring,\u201d says Kritsky. \u201cI\u2019ve also heard reports that the body weight of male turkeys taken during hunting season was larger in areas where cicadas emerged than in areas where there weren\u2019t cicadas.\u201d Even the damage cicadas do to tree branches pays some dividends, serving as a healthy, natural pruning. \u201cIt looks unsightly this year, says Kritsky, \u201cbut the reports are that the flower sets for those trees the next year will be even greater.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mb-8\">\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-6 focus-visible:outline focus-visible:outline-black-coffee focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2 focus-visible:shadow-focus-color text-left\">Finally, death becomes cicadas, with their uncounted little bodies providing nutrients for the soil and trees. \u201cBelow ground they\u2019re collecting nitrogen, phosphorus, and other nutrients,\u201d says Cooley. \u201cThen they come above ground and they\u2019re recycling the nutrients.\u201d The downside to so much decomposition? \u201cThey stink to high heaven,\u201d says Kritsky. \u201cIts a sense memory\u2014if you\u2019ve never smelled it, look for it this year.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"text-mobile-h3 lg:text-h3 font-editorial text-black-coffee text-left mb-6\">How are cicadas faring in a warming world?<\/h2>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-0 focus-visible:outline focus-visible:outline-black-coffee focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2 focus-visible:shadow-focus-color text-left\">Cicadas are \u201cinsects of climate,\u201d as Kritsky calls them. The genus to which they belong emerged about 3.9 million years ago, and the insects moved alternately north and south in response to the advance and retreat of glaciers. Today they are responding to the climate again, changing the timing of their emergence, which usually begins when the soil temperature reaches 64\u00b0F. Those warmer conditions are occurring earlier and earlier each year. \u201cBefore 1940 here in Cincinnati,\u201d Kritsky says, \u201cthe average date of emergence was May 28 or 29. Right now they\u2019re emerging two to two and a half weeks earlier.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"mb-8\">\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-0 focus-visible:outline focus-visible:outline-black-coffee focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2 focus-visible:shadow-focus-color text-left\">Increasingly, the appearance of cicada broods is being tracked by citizen scientists armed with mobile phones and the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/cicadasafari.org\/\">Cicada Safari app<\/a>, which Kritsky and Mount St. Joseph University created. In the 1840s,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/local\/gideon-smith-cicadas\/2021\/05\/26\/51fc5cfc-be34-11eb-83e3-0ca705a96ba4_story.html\">Maryland physician Gideon Smith<\/a>\u00a0took a shine to cicada tracking and began crowd-sourcing sightings, writing to newspapers and asking locals to contact him with reports of the emergence of new cicada swarms. Things moved slowly in that analog era, but they\u2019ve picked up considerably today. People who download Cicada Safari are asked to send pictures of the cicadas they spot to the site; once the images are confirmed, they add to the real-time growth of a map of cicada emergence.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-6 focus-visible:outline focus-visible:outline-black-coffee focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2 focus-visible:shadow-focus-color text-left\">\u201cBack in 2021,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/6047529\/brood-x-cicada\/\">when Brood X emerged<\/a>,\u201d Kritsky says, \u201cwe received over half a million photographs. We verified them to produce the most granular, widespread map of that brood.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"self-baseline font-graphik text-body-large text-black-coffee rich-text mb-0 focus-visible:outline focus-visible:outline-black-coffee focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2 focus-visible:shadow-focus-color text-left\">However many cicadas emerge this year, they will be parlaying their 17 years in the nymph state and their six weeks in the adult state to do just one principal thing: mate and ensure the appearance of the next brood, in 2042. \u201cTheir function,\u201d says Cooley, \u201cis to make more of themselves.
