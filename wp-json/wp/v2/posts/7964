From Silverton, this spur is 2.5 km to the east edge of a big cut block. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Ascending the block northeast along the west bank of a creek, I soon came across a well-defined trail, undoubtedly made during the mining boom on Silver Ridge over 100 years ago. I followed this for over an hour before losing it in the snow several hundred feet below the tree line and the ridge. Gaining the ridge at about GR 830-332, I continued southeast over u\/n 7,650\u2019 (GR 839-325) to the summit of Sandon Peak in 5 hours from the truck. I was slowed by the unpleasant snow, in places nearly bottomless mush, and the many cornices needing careful attention. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">On the summit, I found a cairn with no record and took a refreshing 10 min. break. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">For the descent, I retraced my steps and was surprised to find the trail emerged exactly where my truck was parked (3 hours down). Although I flagged the trailhead with several strips of orange flagging tape, it\u2019s difficult to follow through the cut block as several large trees have fallen on it lengthwise. Once in the timber, it is very clear, although large deadfalls slow progress. Many older deadfalls have been cut out, so someone looked after this trail for years. Perhaps worth exploring to its end for those who are interested in mining history. Although the views were fine, an ascent of Sandon Peak is not recommended unless you\u2019re an aficionado of suffering. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Kim Kratky<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SANDON PEAK\u00a0\u00a0 2346m\u00a0 \u00a07697\u2019 On the SE end of Silver Ridge, it is about 7 km south of Sandon.
