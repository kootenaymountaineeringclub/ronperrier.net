Patrick lies just south of the southern boundary of St. Mary\u2019s Alpine Park in the angle between Dewar Creek and White Creek.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Access is via the Manson Col route: turn east off the Dewar Creek road at the km. 8 sign, about that distance north of the Dewar\/West St. Mary\u2019s junction. The 5.3 km. access road is a rough 4WD, HC LR route that gains 2300\u2019 to a sub-alpine basin at 6600\u2019. This August the road had been brushed out and some washouts had been filled in\u2014much better than in 2004. After catching the 6:30 ferry, Peter Tchir and I drove to the junction at the end of the driveable portion of the access road, tossed out the rope and rock gear, and started hiking at 10:30. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">We followed the upper fork of the road to the east till in 10 min. it petered out in a valley. Turning south, we hiked up shale and talus as we decided the north face of our objective was preferable to the northeast ridge and its gendarmes. We then passed a vestigial glacier and ascended about 400\u2019 of ribs, ramps, and steps of crumbly, metamorphic rock spiced with near-vertical dirt on the north face.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Reaching the summit at 12:30, we inspected the large, flattened cairn and a mostly illegible rain-soaked record and added our entry. During the rest of our 65 min. stay, we puzzled over the purpose of a large lodge-like structure near White Creek far below and to the east.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Eschewing a return via our ascent route, we headed down the twisty northeast ridge, which offered a sporty class 3 descent on decent rock, all ramps, prongs and gendarmes being easily overcome. Reaching the col in 45 min., we then continued north over an easy 8450\u2019 bump (483-163), descended its NNW ridge to a flat section, and at 480-168 encountered the trail to Jurak Lake. We followed this trail west and back down into the basin and, not surprisingly, rejoined our access road near its end.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">After improving flagging and cairns at the sketchy trailhead, we walked back to the truck by 3:35 pm for a 5-hour day. Leaving almost immediately, we easily caught the 7:00 pm Kootenay Lake ferry.
