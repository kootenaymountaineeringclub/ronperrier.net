The president won four-fifths of the votes of white evangelical Christians. This was a higher level of support than either Ronald Reagan or George W. Bush, an outspoken evangelical himself, ever received.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Trump\u2019s background and beliefs could hardly be more incompatible with traditional Christian models of life and leadership. Trump\u2019s past political stances (he once supported the right to partial-birth abortion), his character (he has bragged about sexually assaulting women), and even his language (he introduced the words <i>pussy<\/i> and <i>shithole<\/i> into presidential discourse) would more naturally lead religious conservatives toward exorcism than alliance. This is a man who has cruelly publicized his infidelities, made disturbing sexual comments about his elder daughter, and boasted about the size of his penis on the debate stage. His lawyer reportedly arranged a $130,000 payment to a porn star to dissuade her from disclosing an alleged affair. Yet religious conservatives who once blanched at PG-13 public standards now yawn at such NC-17 maneuvers. We are a long way from <i>The Book of Virtues<\/i>.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-2\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Trump supporters tend to dismiss moral scruples about his behavior as squeamishness over the president\u2019s \u201cstyle.\u201d But the problem is the distinctly non-Christian substance of his <i>values<\/i>. Trump\u2019s unapologetic materialism\u2014his equation of financial and social success with human achievement and worth\u2014is a negation of Christian teaching. His tribalism and hatred for \u201cthe other\u201d stand in direct opposition to Jesus\u2019s radical ethic of neighbor love. Trump\u2019s strength-worship and contempt for \u201closers\u201d smack more of Nietzsche than of Christ. <i>Blessed are the proud. Blessed are the ruthless. Blessed are the shameless. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after fame.<\/i><\/span><\/p>\n<aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">According to Jerry Falwell Jr., evangelicals have \u201cfound their dream president,\u201d which says something about the current quality of evangelical dreams.<\/span><\/aside>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">And yet, a credible case can be made that evangelical votes were a decisive factor in Trump\u2019s improbable victory. Trump himself certainly acts as if he believes they were. Many individuals, causes, and groups that Trump pledged to champion have been swiftly sidelined or sacrificed during Trump\u2019s brief presidency. The administration\u2019s outreach to white evangelicals, however, has been utterly consistent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Trump-allied religious leaders have found an open door at the White House\u2014what Richard Land, the president of the Southern Evangelical Seminary, calls \u201cunprecedented access.\u201d In return, they have rallied behind the administration in its times of need. \u201cClearly, this Russian story is nonsense,\u201d explains the mega-church pastor Paula White-Cain, who is not generally known as a legal or cybersecurity expert. Pastor David Jeremiah has compared Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump to Joseph and Mary: \u201cIt\u2019s just like God to use a young Jewish couple to help Christians.\u201d According to Jerry Falwell Jr., evangelicals have \u201cfound their dream president,\u201d which says something about the current quality of evangelical dreams.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-3\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Loyalty to Trump has involved progressively more difficult, self-abasing demands. And there appears to be no limit to what some evangelical leaders will endure. Figures such as Falwell and Franklin Graham followed Trump\u2019s lead in supporting Judge Roy Moore in the December Senate election in Alabama. These are religious leaders who have spent their entire adult lives bemoaning cultural and moral decay. Yet they publicly backed a candidate who was repeatedly accused of sexual misconduct, including with a 14-year-old girl.<\/span><\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-4\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In January, following reports that Trump had referred to Haiti and African nations as \u201cshithole countries,\u201d Pastor Robert Jeffress came quickly to his defense. \u201cApart from the vocabulary attributed to him,\u201d Jeffress wrote, \u201cPresident Trump is right on target in his sentiment.\u201d After reports emerged that Trump\u2019s lawyer paid hush money to the porn star Stormy Daniels to cover up their alleged sexual encounter, Graham vouched for Trump\u2019s \u201cconcern for Christian values.\u201d Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, argued that Trump should be given a \u201cmulligan\u201d for his past infidelity. One can only imagine the explosion of outrage if President Barack Obama had been credibly accused of similar offenses.The moral convictions of many evangelical leaders have become a function of their partisan identification. This is not mere gullibility; it is utter corruption. Blinded by political tribalism and hatred for their political opponents, these leaders can\u2019t see how they are undermining the causes to which they once dedicated their lives. Little remains of a distinctly Christian public witness.<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">As the prominent evangelical pastor Tim Keller\u2014who is not a Trump loyalist\u2014recently wrote in <i>The New Yorker<\/i>, \u201c\u2009\u2018Evangelical\u2019 used to denote people who claimed the high moral ground; now, in popular usage, the word is nearly synonymous with \u2018hypocrite.\u2019\u2009\u201d So it is little wonder that last year the Princeton Evangelical Fellowship, an 87-year-old ministry, dropped the \u201cE word\u201d from its name, becoming the Princeton Christian Fellowship: Too many students had identified the term with conservative political ideology. Indeed, a number of serious evangelicals are distancing themselves from the word for similar reasons.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-5\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">I find this desire understandable but not compelling. Some words, like strategic castles, are worth defending, and <i>evangelical<\/i> is among them. While the term is notoriously difficult to define, it certainly encompasses a \u201cborn-again\u201d religious experience, a commitment to the authority of the Bible, and an emphasis on the redemptive power of Jesus Christ.I was raised in an evangelical home, went to an evangelical church and high school, and began following Christ as a teen. After attending Georgetown University for a year, I transferred to Wheaton College in Illinois\u2014sometimes called \u201cthe Harvard of evangelical Protestantism\u201d\u2014where I studied theology. I worked at an evangelical nonprofit, Prison Fellowship, before becoming a staffer for Senator Dan Coats of Indiana (a fellow Wheaton alum). On Capitol Hill, I found many evangelical partners in trying to define a \u201ccompassionate conservatism.\u201d And as a policy adviser and the chief speechwriter to President George W. Bush, I saw how evangelical leaders such as Rick and Kay Warren could be principled, tireless advocates in the global fight against <span class=\"smallcaps\">aids<\/span>.<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Those experiences make me hesitant to abandon the word <i>evangelical<\/i>. They also make seeing the defilement of that word all the more painful. The corruption of a political party is regrettable. The corruption of a religious tradition by politics is tragic, shaming those who participate in it.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-6\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">How did something so important and admirable become so disgraced? For many people, including myself, this question involves both intellectual analysis and personal angst. The answer extends back some 150 years, and involves cultural and political shifts that long pre-date Donald Trump. It is the story of how an influential and culturally confident religious movement became a marginalized and anxious minority seeking political protection under the wing of a man such as Trump, the least traditionally Christian figure\u2014in temperament, behavior, and evident belief\u2014to assume the presidency in living memory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"dropcap\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">U<span class=\"smallcaps\">nderstanding that evolution <\/span>requires understanding the values that once animated American evangelicalism. It is a movement that was damaged in the fall from a great height.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">My alma mater, Wheaton College, was founded by abolitionist evangelicals in 1860 under the leadership of Jonathan Blanchard, an emblematic figure in mid-19th-century Northern evangelicalism. Blanchard was part of a generation of radical malcontents produced by the Second Great Awakening, a religious revival that had touched millions of American lives in the first half of the 19th century. He was a Presbyterian minister, a founder of several radical newspapers, and an antislavery agitator.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In the years before the Civil War, a connection between moralism and a concern for social justice was generally assumed among Northern evangelicals. They variously militated for temperance, humane treatment of the mentally disabled, and prison reform. But mainly they militated for the end of slavery. \u2029Indeed, Wheaton welcomed both African American and female students, and served as a stop on the Underground Railroad. In a history of the 39th Regiment of the Illinois Volunteer Infantry, the infantryman Ezra Cook recalled that \u201crunaway slaves were perfectly safe in the College building, even when no attempt was made to conceal their presence.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-7\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Blanchard had explained his beliefs in an 1839 commencement address given at Oberlin College, titled \u201cA Perfect State of Society.\u201d He preached that \u201cevery true minister of Christ is a universal reformer, whose business it is, so far as possible, to reform all the evils which press on human concerns.\u201d Elsewhere he argued that \u201cslave-holding is not a solitary, but a social sin.\u201d He added: \u201cI rest my opposition to slavery upon the one-bloodism of the New Testament. All men are equal, because they are of one equal blood.\u201dDuring this period, evangelicalism was largely identical to mainstream Protestantism. Evangelicals varied widely in their denominational beliefs, but they uniformly agreed about the need for a personal decision to accept God\u2019s grace through faith in Christ. The evangelist Charles G. Finney, who was the president of Oberlin College from 1851 to 1866, described his conversion experience thusly: \u201cI could feel the impression, like a wave of electricity, going through and through me. Indeed it seemed to come in waves and waves of liquid love.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Early evangelicals were an optimistic lot who thought that human effort could help hasten the arrival of the Second Coming.<\/span><\/aside>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In politics, evangelicals tended to identify New England, and then the whole country, with biblical Israel. Many a sermon described America as a place set apart for divine purposes. \u201cSome nation,\u201d the evangelical minister Lyman Beecher said, \u201citself free, was needed, to blow the trumpet and hold up the light.\u201d (Beecher\u2019s daughter Harriet Beecher Stowe was among the founders of this magazine.) The burden of this calling was a collective responsibility to remain virtuous, in matters from ending slavery to ending Sabbath-breaking.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-8\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">This was not advocacy for theocracy, and evangelical leaders were not blind to the risks of too close a relationship with worldly power. \u201cThe injudicious association of religion with politics, in the time of Cromwell,\u201d Beecher argued, \u201cbrought upon evangelical doctrine and piety, in England, an odium which has not ceased to this day.\u201d Yet few evangelicals would have denied that God\u2019s covenantal relationship with America required a higher standard of private and public morality, lest that divine blessing be forfeited.Perhaps most important, prior to the Civil War, evangelicals were by and large postmillennialists\u2014that is, they believed that the final millennium of human history would be a time of peace for the world and of expansion for the Christian Church, culminating in the Second Coming of Christ. As such, they were an optimistic lot who thought that human effort could help hasten the arrival of this promised era\u2014a belief that encouraged both social activism and global missionary activity. \u201cEvangelicals generally regarded almost any sort of progress as evidence of the advance of the kingdom,\u201d the historian George Marsden observes in <i>Fundamentalism and American Culture<\/i>.<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In the mid-19th century, evangelicalism was the predominant religious tradition in America<i>\u2014<\/i>a faith assured of its social position, confident in its divine calling, welcoming of progress, and hopeful about the future. Fifty years later, it was losing intellectual and social ground on every front. Twenty-five years beyond that, it had become a national joke.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-9\">\n<p class=\"dropcap\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">T<span class=\"smallcaps\">he horrors of the civil war<\/span> took a severe toll on the social optimism at the heart of postmillennialism. It was harder to believe in the existence of a religious golden age that included Antietam. At the same time, industrialization and urbanization loosened traditional social bonds and created an impression of moral chaos. The mass immigration of Catholics and Jews changed the face and spiritual self-conception of the country. (In 1850, Catholics made up about 5 percent of the population. By 1906, they represented 17 percent.) Evangelicals struggled to envision a diverse, and some believed degenerate, America as the chosen, godly republic of their imagination.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">But it was a series of momentous intellectual developments that most effectively drove a wedge between evangelicalism and elite culture. Higher criticism of the Bible\u2014a scholarly movement out of Germany that picked apart the human sources and development of ancient texts\u2014called into question the roots, accuracy, and historicity of the book that constituted the ultimate source of evangelical authority. At the same time, the theory of evolution advanced a new account of human origin. Advocates of evolution, as well as those who denied it most vigorously, took the theory as an alternative to religious accounts\u2014and in many cases to Christian belief itself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Religious progressives sought common ground between the Christian faith and the new science and higher criticism. Many combined their faith with the Social Gospel\u2014a postmillennialism drained of the miraculous, with social reform taking the place of the Second Coming.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-10\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Religious conservatives, by contrast, rebelled against this strategy of accommodation in a series of firings and heresy trials designed to maintain control of seminaries. (Woodrow Wilson\u2019s uncle James lost his job at Columbia Theological Seminary for accepting evolution as compatible with the Bible.) But these tactics generally backfired, and seminary after seminary, college after college, fell under the influence of modern scientific and cultural assumptions. To contest progressive ideas, the religiously orthodox published a series of books called <i>The Fundamentals<\/i>. Hence the term <i>fundamentalism<\/i>, conceived in a spirit of desperate reaction.Fundamentalism embraced traditional religious views, but it did not propose a return to an older evangelicalism. Instead it responded to modernity in ways that cut it off from its own past. In reacting against higher criticism, it became simplistic and overliteral in its reading of scripture. In reacting against evolution, it became anti-scientific in its general orientation. In reacting against the Social Gospel, it came to regard the whole concept of social justice as a dangerous liberal idea. This last point constituted what some scholars have called the \u201cGreat Reversal,\u201d which took place from about 1900 to 1930. \u201cAll progressive social concern,\u201d Marsden writes, \u201cwhether political or private, became suspect among revivalist evangelicals and was relegated to a very minor role.\u201d<\/span><\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-11\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">This general pessimism about the direction of society was reflected in a shift away from postmillennialism and toward <i>pre<\/i>millennialism. In this view, the current age is tending not toward progress, but rather toward decadence and chaos under the influence of Satan. A new and better age will not be inaugurated until the Second Coming of Christ, who is the only one capable of cleaning up the mess. No amount of human effort can hasten that day, or ultimately save a doomed world. For this reason, social activism was deemed irrelevant to the most essential task: the work of preparing oneself, and helping others prepare, for final judgment.The banishment of fundamentalism from the cultural mainstream culminated dramatically in a Tennessee courthouse in 1925. William Jennings Bryan, the most prominent Christian politician of his time, was set against Clarence Darrow and the theory of evolution at the Scopes \u201cmonkey trial,\u201d in which a Tennessee educator was tried for teaching the theory in high school. Bryan won the case but not the country. The journalist and critic H. L. Mencken provided the account accepted by history, dismissing Bryan as \u201ca tin pot pope in the Coca-Cola belt and a brother to the forlorn pastors who belabor half-wits in galvanized iron tabernacles behind the railroad yards.\u201d Fundamentalists became comic figures, subject to world-class condescension.<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">It has largely slipped the mind of history that Bryan was a peace activist as secretary of state under Woodrow Wilson and that his politics foreshadowed the New Deal. And Mencken was eventually revealed as a racist, an anti-Semite, and a eugenics advocate. In the fundamentalist\u2013modernist controversy, there was only one winner. \u201cIn the course of roughly thirty-five years,\u201d the sociologist James Davison Hunter observes in <i>American Evangelicalism<\/i>, \u201cProtestantism had moved from a position of cultural dominance to a position of cognitive marginality and political impotence.\u201d Activism and optimism were replaced by the festering resentment of status lost.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-12\">\n<p class=\"dropcap\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">T<span class=\"smallcaps\">he fundamentalists were not passive<\/span> in their exile. They created a web of institutions\u2014radio stations, religious schools, outreach ministries\u2014that eventually constituted a healthy subculture. The country, meanwhile, was becoming less secular and more welcoming of religious influence. (In 1920, church membership in the United States was 43 percent. By 1960, it was 63 percent.) A number of leaders, including the theologian Carl Henry and the evangelist Billy Graham (the father of Franklin Graham), bridled at fundamentalist irrelevance. Henry\u2019s book <i>The Uneasy Conscience of Modern Fundamentalism<\/i> was influential in urging greater cultural and intellectual engagement. This reemergence found its fullest expression in Graham, who left the fundamentalist ghetto, hobnobbed with presidents, and presented to the public a more appealing version of evangelicalism\u2014a term that was deliberately employed as a contrast to the older, narrower fundamentalism.<\/span><\/p>\n<aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Fox News and conservative talk radio are vastly greater influences on evangelicals\u2019 political identity than formal statements by religious denominations.<\/span><\/aside>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Not everyone was impressed. When Graham planned mass evangelistic meetings in New York City in 1957, the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr editorialized against his \u201cpetty moralizing.\u201d But Niebuhr\u2019s attack on Graham provoked significant backlash, even in liberal theological circles. During a 16-week \u201ccrusade\u201d that played to packed houses, Graham was joined one night at Madison Square Garden by none other than Martin Luther King Jr.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-13\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Over time, evangelicalism got a revenge of sorts in its historical rivalry with liberal Christianity. Adherents of the latter gradually found better things to do with their Sundays than attend progressive services. In 1972, nearly 28 percent of the population belonged to mainline-Protestant churches. That figure is now well below 15 percent. Over those four decades, however, evangelicals held steady at roughly 25 percent of the public (though this share has recently declined). As its old theological rival faded\u2014or, more accurately, collapsed\u2014evangelical endurance felt a lot like momentum.With the return of this greater institutional self-confidence, evangelicals might have expected to play a larger role in determining cultural norms and standards. But their hopes ran smack into the sexual revolution, along with other rapid social changes. The Moral Majority appeared at about the same time that the actual majority was more and more comfortable with divorce and couples living together out of wedlock. Evangelicals experienced the power of growing numbers and healthy subcultural institutions even as elite institutions\u2014from universities to courts to Hollywood\u2014were decisively rejecting traditional ideals.<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">As a result, the primary evangelical political narrative is adversarial, an angry tale about the aggression of evangelicalism\u2019s cultural rivals. In a remarkably free country, many evangelicals view their rights as fragile, their institutions as threatened, and their dignity as assailed. The single largest religious demographic in the United States\u2014representing about half the Republican political coalition\u2014sees itself as a besieged and disrespected minority. In this way, evangelicals have become simultaneously more engaged and more alienated.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-14\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The overall political disposition of evangelical politics has remained decidedly conservative, and also decidedly reactive. After shamefully sitting out (or even opposing) the civil-rights movement, white evangelicals became activated on a limited range of issues. They defended Christian schools against regulation during Jimmy Carter\u2019s administration. They fought against Supreme Court decisions that put tight restrictions on school prayer and removed many state limits on abortion. The sociologist Nathan Glazer describes such efforts as a \u201cdefensive offensive\u201d\u2014a kind of morally indignant pushback against a modern world that, in evangelicals\u2019 view, had grown hostile and oppressive.This attitude was happily exploited by the modern GOP. Evangelicals who were alienated by the pro-choice secularism of Democratic presidential nominees were effectively courted to join the Reagan coalition. \u201cI know that you can\u2019t endorse me,\u201d Reagan told an evangelical conference in 1980, \u201cbut I only brought that up because I want you to know that I endorse you.\u201d In contrast, during his presidential run four years later, Walter Mondale warned of \u201cradical preachers,\u201d and his running mate, Geraldine Ferraro, denounced the \u201cextremists who control the Republican Party.\u201d By attacking evangelicals, the Democratic Party left them with a relatively easy partisan choice.<picture><\/picture><\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The leaders who had emerged within evangelicalism varied significantly in tone and approach. Billy Graham was the uncritical priest to the powerful. (His inclination to please was memorialized on one of the Nixon tapes, in comments enabling the president\u2019s anti-Semitism.) James Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family, was the prickly prophet, constantly threatening to bolt from the Republican coalition unless social-conservative purity was maintained. Jerry Falwell Sr. and Pat Robertson (the latter of whom ran for president himself in 1988) tried to be political kingmakers. And, following his dramatic conversion, Chuck Colson, of Watergate infamy, founded Prison Fellowship in an attempt to revive some of the old abolitionist spirit as an advocate of prison reform. Yet much of this variety was blurred in the public mind, with <i>religious right<\/i> used as a catchall epithet.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-15\">\n<p class=\"dropcap\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">W<span class=\"smallcaps\">here did this history<\/span> leave evangelicals\u2019 political involvement?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">For a start, modern evangelicalism has an important intellectual piece missing. It lacks a model or ideal of political engagement\u2014an organizing theory of social action. Over the same century from Blanchard to Falwell, Catholics developed a coherent, comprehensive tradition of social and political reflection. Catholic social thought includes a commitment to solidarity, whereby justice in a society is measured by the treatment of its weakest and most vulnerable members. And it incorporates the principle of subsidiarity\u2014the idea that human needs are best met by small and local institutions (though higher-order institutions have a moral responsibility to intervene when local ones fail).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In practice, this acts as an \u201cif, then\u201d requirement for Catholics, splendidly complicating their politics: If you want to call yourself pro-life on abortion, then you have to oppose the dehumanization of migrants. If you criticize the devaluation of life by euthanasia, then you must criticize the devaluation of life by racism. If you want to be regarded as pro-family, then you have to support access to health care. And vice versa. The doctrinal whole requires a broad, consistent view of justice, which\u2014when it is faithfully applied\u2014cuts across the categories and clich\u00e9s of American politics. Of course, American Catholics routinely ignore Catholic social thought. But at least they have it. Evangelicals lack a similar tradition of their own to disregard.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-16\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">So where do evangelicals get their theory of social engagement? It is cheating to say (as most evangelicals probably would) \u201cthe Bible.\u201d The Christian Bible, after all, can be a vexing document: At various points, it offers approving accounts of genocide and recommends the stoning of insubordinate children. Some interpretive theory must elevate the Golden Rule above Iron Age ethics and apply that higher ideal to the tragic compromises of public life. Lacking an equivalent to Catholic social thought, many evangelicals seem to find their theory merely by following the contours of the political movement that is currently defending, and exploiting, them. The voter guides of religious conservatives have often been suspiciously similar to the political priorities of movement conservatism. Fox News and talk radio are vastly greater influences on evangelicals\u2019 political identity than formal statements by religious denominations or from the National Association of Evangelicals. In this Christian political movement, Christian theology is emphatically not the primary motivating factor.The evangelical political agenda, moreover, has been narrowed by its supremely reactive nature. Rather than choosing their own agendas, evangelicals have been pulled into a series of social and political debates started by others. Why the asinine issue of spiritually barren prayer in public schools? Because of Justice Hugo Black\u2019s 1962 opinion rendering it unconstitutional. Why such an effort-wasting emphasis on a constitutional amendment to end abortion, which will never pass? Because in 1973 Justice Harry Blackmun located the right to abortion in the constitutional penumbra. Why the current emphasis on religious liberty? Because the 2015 <i>Obergefell v. Hodges<\/i> decision legalizing same-sex marriage has raised fears of coercion.<\/span><\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-17\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">It is not that secularization, abortion, and religious liberty are trivial issues; they are extremely important. But the timing and emphasis of evangelical responses have contributed to a broad sense that evangelical political engagement is negative, censorious, and oppositional. This funneled focus has also created the damaging impression that Christians are obsessed with sex. Much of the secular public hears from Christians only on issues of sexuality\u2014from contraceptive mandates to gay rights to transgender bathroom usage. And while religious people do believe that sexual ethics are important, the nature of contemporary religious engagement creates a misimpression about just how important they are relative to other crucial issues.The upside potential of evangelical social engagement was illustrated by an important, but largely overlooked, initiative that I witnessed while working at the White House. The President\u2019s Emergency Plan for <span class=\"smallcaps\">aids<\/span> Relief (<span class=\"smallcaps\">pepfar<\/span>)\u2014the largest initiative by a nation in history to fight a single disease\u2014emerged in part from a sense of moral obligation informed by George W. Bush\u2019s evangelical faith. In explaining and defending the program, Bush made constant reference to Luke 12:48: \u201cTo whom much is given, much is required.\u201d <span class=\"smallcaps\">pepfar<\/span> also owes its existence to a strange-bedfellows political alliance of liberal global-health advocates and evangelical leaders, who had particular standing and sway with Republican members of Congress. Rather than being a response to secular aggression, this form of evangelical social engagement was the reaction to a massive humanitarian need and displayed a this-worldly emphasis on social justice that helped save millions of lives.<\/span><\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-18\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">This achievement is now given little attention by secular liberals or religious conservatives. In the Trump era, evangelical leaders have seldom brought this type of issue to the policy front burner\u2014though some have tried with criminal-justice reform and the fight against modern slavery. Individual Christians and evangelical ministries fight preventable disease, resettle refugees, treat addiction, run homeless shelters, and care for foster children. But such concerns find limited collective political expression.Part of the reason such matters are not higher on the evangelical agenda is surely the relative ethnic and racial insularity of many white evangelicals. Plenty of African Americans hold evangelical theological views, of course, along with a growing number of Latinos. Yet evangelical churches, like other churches and houses of worship, tend to be segregated on Sunday. Nearly all denominations with large numbers of evangelicals are less racially diverse than the country overall.<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Compare this with the Catholic Church, which is more than one-third Hispanic. This has naturally stretched the priorities of Catholicism to include the needs and rights of recent immigrants. In many evangelical communities, those needs remain distant and theoretical (though successful evangelical churches in urban areas are now experiencing the same diversity and broadening of social concern). Or consider the contrasting voting behaviors of white and African American evangelicals in last year\u2019s Senate race in Alabama. According to exit polls, 80 percent of white evangelicals voted for Roy Moore, while 95 percent of black evangelicals supported his Democratic opponent, Doug Jones. The two groups inhabit two entirely different political worlds.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<figure class=\"full-width\"><picture><\/picture><figcaption class=\"caption\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Evangelical leaders such as Jerry Falwell Jr. and Franklin Graham followed Trump\u2019s lead in supporting Roy Moore\u2019s Senate candidacy in Alabama, despite multiple accusations of sexual misconduct against him.

But the attribution of depravity and decline to America also reflects a consistent and (so far) disappointed belief that the Second Coming may be just around history\u2019s corner.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-20\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The difficulty with this approach to public life\u2014other than its insanely pessimistic depiction of our flawed but wonderful country\u2014is that it trivializes and undercuts the entire political enterprise. Politics in a democracy is essentially anti-apocalyptic, premised on the idea that an active citizenry is capable of improving the nation. But if we\u2019re already mere minutes from the midnight hour, then what is the point? The normal avenues of political reform are useless. No amount of negotiation or compromise is going to matter much compared with the Second Coming.Moreover, in making their case on cultural decay and decline, evangelicals have, in some highly visible cases, chosen the wrong nightmares. Most notable, they made a crucial error in picking evolution as a main point of contention with modernity. \u201cThe contest between evolution and Christianity is a duel to the death,\u201d William Jennings Bryan argued. \u201cIf evolution wins \u2026 Christianity goes<i>\u2014<\/i>not suddenly, of course, but gradually, for the two cannot stand together.\u201d Many people of his background believed this. But their resistance was futile, for one incontrovertible reason: Evolution is a fact. It is objectively true based on overwhelming evidence. By denying this, evangelicals made their entire view of reality suspect. They were insisting, in effect, that the Christian faith requires a flight from reason.<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">This was foolish and unnecessary. There is no meaningful theological difference between creation by divine intervention and creation by natural selection; both are consistent with belief in a purposeful universe, and with serious interpretation of biblical texts. Evangelicals have placed an entirely superfluous stumbling block before their neighbors and children, encouraging every young person who loves science to reject Christianity.<\/span><\/p>\n<aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Evangelicals remain the most loyal element of the Trump coalition. They are broadly eager to act as his shield and sword. They are his army of enablers.<\/span><\/aside>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">What if Bryan and others of his generation had chosen to object to eugenics rather than evolution, to social Darwinism rather than Darwinism? The textbook at issue in the Scopes case, after all, was titled <i>A Civic Biology<\/i>, and it urged sterilization for the mentally impaired. \u201cEpilepsy, and feeble-mindedness,\u201d the text read, \u201care handicaps which it is not only unfair but criminal to hand down to posterity.\u201d What if this had been the focus of Bryan\u2019s objection? Mencken doubtless would still have mocked. But the moral and theological priorities of evangelical Christianity would have turned out differently. And evangelical fears would have been eventually justified by America\u2019s shameful history of eugenics, and by the more rigorous application of the practice abroad. Instead, Bryan chose evolution\u2014and in the end, the cause of human dignity was not served by the obscuring of human origins.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-21\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The consequences, especially for younger generations, are considerable. According to a recent survey by Barna, a Christian research firm, more than half of churchgoing Christian teens believe that \u201cthe church seems to reject much of what science tells us about the world.\u201d This may be one reason that, in America, the youngest age cohorts are the least religiously affiliated, which will change the nation\u2019s baseline of religiosity over time. More than a third of Millennials say they are unaffiliated with any faith, up 10 points since 2007. Count this as an ironic achievement of religious conservatives: an overall decline in identification with religion itself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"dropcap\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">B<span class=\"smallcaps\">y the turn of the millennium,<\/span> many, including myself, were convinced that religious conservatism was fading as a political force. Its outsize leaders were aging and passing. Its institutions seemed to be declining in profile and influence. Bush\u2019s 2000 campaign attempted to appeal to religious voters on a new basis. \u201cCompassionate conservatism\u201d was designed to be a policy application of Catholic social thought\u2014an attempt to serve the poor, homeless, and addicted by catalyzing the work of private and religious nonprofits. The effort was sincere but eventually undermined by congressional-Republican resistance and eclipsed by global crisis. Still, I believed that the old evangelical model of social engagement was exhausted, and that something more positive and principled was in the offing.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-22\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">I was wrong. In fact, evangelicals would prove highly vulnerable to a message of resentful, declinist populism. Donald Trump could almost have been echoing the apocalyptic warnings of Metaxas and Graham when he declared, \u201cOur country\u2019s going to hell.\u201d Or: \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.\u201d Given Trump\u2019s general level of religious knowledge, he likely had no idea that he was adapting premillennialism to populism. But when the candidate talked of an America in decline and headed toward destruction, which could be returned to greatness only by recovering the certainties of the past, he was strumming resonant chords of evangelical conviction.Trump consistently depicts evangelicals as they depict themselves: a mistreated minority, in need of a defender who plays by worldly rules. Christianity is \u201cunder siege,\u201d Trump told a Liberty University audience. \u201cRelish the opportunity to be an outsider,\u201d he added at a later date: \u201cEmbrace the label.\u201d Protecting Christianity, Trump essentially argues, is a job for a bully.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure><picture><\/picture><figcaption class=\"caption\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Trump consistently depicts evangelicals as they depict themselves: a mistreated minority, in need of a defender who plays by worldly rules.<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">It is true that insofar as Christian hospitals or colleges have their religious liberty threatened by hostile litigation or government agencies, they have every right to defend their institutional identities\u2014to advocate for a principled pluralism. But this is different from evangelicals regarding themselves, hysterically and with self-pity, as an oppressed minority that requires a strongman to rescue it. This is how Trump has invited evangelicals to view themselves. He has treated evangelicalism as an interest group in need of protection and preferences.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-23\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">A prominent company of evangelical leaders\u2014including Dobson, Falwell, Graham, Jeffress, Metaxas, Perkins, and Ralph Reed\u2014has embraced this self-conception. Their justification is often bluntly utilitarian: All of Trump\u2019s flaws are worth his conservative judicial appointments and more-favorable treatment of Christians by the government. But they have gone much further than grudging, prudential calculation. They have basked in access to power and provided character references in the midst of scandal. Graham castigated the critics of Trump\u2019s response to the violence during a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia (\u201cShame on the politicians who are trying to push blame on @POTUS\u201d). Dobson has pronounced Trump a \u201cbaby Christian\u201d\u2014a political use of grace that borders on blasphemy. \u201cComplaining about the temperament of the @POTUS or saying his behavior is not presidential is no longer relevant,\u201d Falwell tweeted. \u201c[Donald Trump] has single-handedly changed the definition of what behavior is \u2018presidential\u2019 from phony, failed &amp; rehearsed to authentic, successful &amp; down to earth.\u201dIt is remarkable to hear religious leaders defend profanity, ridicule, and cruelty as hallmarks of authenticity and dismiss decency as a dead language. Whatever Trump\u2019s policy legacy ends up being, his presidency has been a disaster in the realm of norms. It has coarsened our culture, given permission for bullying, complicated the moral formation of children, undermined standards of public integrity, and encouraged cynicism about the political enterprise. Falwell, Graham, and others are providing religious cover for moral squalor\u2014winking at trashy behavior and encouraging the unraveling of social restraints. Instead of defending their convictions, they are providing preemptive absolution for their political favorites. And this, even by purely political standards, undermines the causes they embrace. Turning a blind eye to the exploitation of women certainly doesn\u2019t help in making pro-life arguments. It materially undermines the movement, which must ultimately change not only the composition of the courts but the views of the public. Having given politics pride of place, these evangelical leaders have ceased to be moral leaders in any meaningful sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Every strong Trump supporter has decided that racism is not a moral disqualification in the president of the United States.<\/span><\/aside>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">But setting matters of decency aside, evangelicals are risking their faith\u2019s reputation on matters of race. Trump has, after all, attributed Kenyan citizenship to Obama, stereotyped Mexican migrants as murderers and rapists, claimed unfair treatment in federal court based on a judge\u2019s Mexican heritage, attempted an unconstitutional Muslim ban, equivocated on the Charlottesville protests, claimed (according to <i>The New York Times<\/i>) that Nigerians would never \u201cgo back to their huts\u201d after seeing America, and dismissed Haitian and African immigrants as undesirable compared with Norwegians.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">For some of Trump\u2019s political allies, racist language and arguments are part of his appeal. For evangelical leaders, they should be sources of anguish. Given America\u2019s history of slavery and segregation, racial prejudice is a special category of moral wrong. Fighting racism galvanized the religious conscience of 19th-century evangelicals and 20th-century African American civil-rights activists. Perpetuating racism indicted many white Christians in the South and elsewhere as hypocrites. Americans who are wrong on this issue do not understand the nature of their country. Christians who are wrong on this issue do not understand the most-basic requirements of their faith.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Here is the uncomfortable reality: I do not believe that most evangelicals are racist. But every strong Trump supporter has decided that racism is not a moral disqualification in the president of the United States. And that is something more than a political compromise. It is a revelation of moral priorities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">If utilitarian calculations are to be applied, they need to be fully applied. For a package of political benefits, these evangelical leaders have associated the Christian faith with racism and nativism. They have associated the Christian faith with misogyny and the mocking of the disabled. They have associated the Christian faith with lawlessness, corruption, and routine deception. They have associated the Christian faith with moral confusion about the surpassing evils of white supremacy and neo-Nazism. The world is full of tragic choices and compromises. But for<i> this<\/i> man? For <i>this<\/i> cause?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Some evangelical leaders, it is worth affirming, are providing alternative models of social engagement. Consider Tim Keller, who is perhaps the most influential advocate of a more politically and demographically diverse evangelicalism. Or Russell Moore, the president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, who demonstrates how moral conservatism can be both principled and inclusive. Or Gary Haugen, the founder of the International Justice Mission, who is one of the world\u2019s leading activists against modern slavery. Or Bishop Claude Alexander of the Park Church in North Carolina, who has been a strong voice for reconciliation and mercy. Or Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, who shows the deep compatibility of authentic faith and authentic science. Or the influential Bible teacher Beth Moore, who has warned of the damage done \u201cwhen we sell our souls to buy our wins.\u201d Or the writer Peter Wehner, who has ceased to describe himselfas an evangelical even as he exemplifies the very best of the word.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Evangelicalism is hardly a monolithic movement. All of the above leaders would attest that a significant generational shift is occurring: Younger evangelicals are less prone to political divisiveness and bitterness and more concerned with social justice. (In a poll last summer, nearly half of white evangelicals born since 1964 expressed support for gay marriage.) Evangelicals remain essential to political coalitions advocating prison reform and supporting American global-health initiatives, particularly on <span class=\"smallcaps\">aids<\/span> and malaria. They do good work in the world through relief organizations such as World Vision and Samaritan\u2019s Purse (an admirable relief organization of which Franklin Graham is the president and CEO). They perform countless acts of love and compassion that make local communities more just and generous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">All of this is arguably a strong foundation for evangelical recovery. But it would be a mistake to regard the problem as limited to a few irresponsible leaders. Those leaders represent a clear majority of the movement, which remains the most loyal element of the Trump coalition. Evangelicals are broadly eager to act as Trump\u2019s shield and sword. They are his army of enablers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">It is the strangest story: how so many evangelicals lost their interest in decency, and how a religious tradition called by grace became defined by resentment. This is bad for America, because religion, properly viewed and applied, is essential to the country\u2019s public life. The old \u201cone-bloodism\u201d of Christian anthropology\u2014the belief in the intrinsic and equal value of all human lives\u2014has driven centuries of compassionate service and social reform. Religion can be the carrier of conscience. It can motivate sacrifice for the common good. It can reinforce the nobility of the political enterprise. It can combat dehumanization and elevate the goals and ideals of public life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Democracy is not merely a set of procedures. It has a moral structure. The values we celebrate or stigmatize eventually influence the character of our people and polity. Democracy does not insist on perfect virtue from its leaders. But there is a set of values that lends authority to power: empathy, honesty, integrity, and self-restraint. And the legitimation of cruelty, prejudice, falsehood, and corruption is the kind of thing, one would think, that religious people were born to oppose, not bless. This disfigurement of evangelical faith squanders the reputation of something valuable: not just the vision of human dignity that captured Blanchard, but also Finney\u2019s electric waves of grace. At its best, faith is the overflow of gratitude, the attempt to live as if we are loved, the fragile hope for something better on the other side of pain and death. And this feather of grace weighs more in the balance than any political gain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">It is difficult to see something you so deeply value discredited so comprehensively. Evangelical faith has shaped my life, as it has the lives of millions. Evangelical history has provided me with models of conscience. Evangelical institutions have given me gifts of learning and purpose. Evangelical friends have shared my joys and sorrows. And now the very word is brought into needless disrepute.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">This is the result when Christians become one interest group among many, scrambling for benefits at the expense of others rather than seeking the welfare of the whole. Christianity is love of neighbor, or it has lost its way. And this sets an urgent task for evangelicals: to rescue their faith from its worst leaders.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"authors\">\n<li class=\"author without-headshot\">\n<div class=\"bio\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">MICHAEL GERSON is a nationally syndicated columnist appearing twice weekly in <em>The Washington Post<\/em>.

The mid-Atlantic humidity was sweating through the windows of my chauffeured car. I was running late and fighting to stay awake. For two weeks, I\u2019d been sprinting between television and radio studios up and down the East Coast, promoting my new book on the collapse of the post\u2013George W. Bush Republican Party and the ascent of Donald Trump. Now I had one final interview for the day. My publicist had offered to cancel\u2014it wasn\u2019t that important, she said\u2014but I didn\u2019t want to. It\u00a0<i>was<\/i> important. After the car pulled over on M Street Northwest, I hustled into the stone-pillared building of the Christian Broadcasting Network.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">All in a blur, the producers took my cellphone, mic\u2019d me up, and shoved me onto the set with the news anchor John Jessup. Camera rolling, Jessup skipped past the small talk. He was keen to know, given his audience, what I had learned about the president\u2019s alliance with America\u2019s white evangelicals. Despite being a lecherous, impenitent scoundrel\u2014the 2016 campaign was marked by\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/politics\/2016-election\/donald-trump-criticized-after-he-appears-mock-reporter-serge-kovaleski-n470016\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">his mocking of a disabled man<\/a>, his xenophobic slander of immigrants, his casual calls to violence against political opponents\u2014Trump had won\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2016\/11\/08\/us\/politics\/election-exit-polls.html\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">a historic 81 percent of white evangelical voters<\/a>. Yet that statistic was just a surface-level indicator of the foundational shifts taking place inside the Church. Polling showed that born-again Christian conservatives, once the president\u2019s softest backers, were now his most unflinching advocates. Jessup had the same question as millions of other Americans: Why?<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">As a believer in Jesus Christ\u2014and as the son of an evangelical minister, raised in a conservative church in a conservative community\u2014I had long struggled with how to answer this question. The truth is, I knew lots of Christians who, to varying degrees, supported the president, and there was no way to summarily describe their diverse attitudes, motivations, and behaviors. They were best understood as points plotted across a spectrum. At one end were the Christians who maintained their dignity while voting for Trump\u2014people who were clear-eyed in understanding that backing a candidate, pragmatically and prudentially, need not lead to unconditionally promoting, empowering, and apologizing for that candidate. At the opposite end were the Christians who had jettisoned their credibility\u2014people who embraced the charge of being reactionary hypocrites, still fuming about Bill Clinton\u2019s character as they jumped at the chance to go slumming with a playboy turned president.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Most of the Christians I knew fell somewhere in the middle. They had to some extent been\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/magazine\/archive\/2018\/04\/the-last-temptation\/554066\/\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">seduced by the cult of Trumpism<\/a>, yet to composite all of these people into a caricature was misleading. Something more profound was taking place. Something was happening in the country\u2014something was happening in the Church\u2014that we had never seen before. I had attempted, ever so delicately, to make these points in my book. Now, on the TV set, I was doing a similar dance.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Jessup seemed to sense my reticence. Pivoting from the book, he asked me about a recent flare-up in the evangelical world. In response to the Trump administration\u2019s policy of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/magazine\/archive\/2022\/09\/trump-administration-family-separation-policy-immigration\/670604\/\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">forcibly separating migrant families<\/a>\u00a0at the U.S.-Mexico border, Russell Moore, a prominent leader with the Southern Baptist Convention,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/drmoore\/status\/1143418475723055106\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">had tweeted<\/a>, \u201cThose created in the image of God should be treated with dignity and compassion, especially those seeking refuge from violence back home.\u201d At this, Jerry Falwell Jr.\u2014the son and namesake of the Moral Majority founder, and then-president of Liberty University, one of the world\u2019s largest Christian colleges\u2014took great offense. \u201cWho are you @drmoore?\u201d\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JerryFalwellJr\/status\/1143613031450103813\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">he replied<\/a>. \u201cHave you ever made a payroll? Have you ever built an organization of any type from scratch? What gives you authority to speak on any issue?\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">This being Twitter and all, I decided to chime in. \u201cThere are Russell Moore Christians and Jerry Falwell Jr. Christians,\u201d I wrote, summarizing the back-and-forth. \u201cChoose wisely, brothers and sisters.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Now Jessup was reading my tweet on-air. \u201cDo you really see evangelicals divided into two camps?\u201d the anchor asked.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">I stumbled. Conceding that it might be an \u201coversimplification,\u201d I warned still of a \u201cfundamental disconnect\u201d between Christians who view issues through the eyes of Jesus and Christians who process everything through a partisan political filter.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">As the interview ended, I knew I\u2019d botched an opportunity to state plainly my qualms about the American evangelical Church. Truth be told, I\u00a0<i>did<\/i>\u00a0see evangelicals divided into two camps\u2014one side faithful to an eternal covenant, the other side bowing to earthly idols of nation and influence and fame\u2014but I was too scared to say so. My own Christian walk had been so badly flawed. And besides, I\u2019m no theologian; Jessup was asking for my journalistic analysis, not my biblical exegesis.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Walking off the set, I wondered if my dad might catch that clip. Surely somebody at our home church would see it and pass it along. I grabbed my phone, then stopped to chat with Jessup and a few of his colleagues. As we said our farewells, I looked down at the phone, which had been silenced. There were multiple missed calls from my wife and oldest brother. Dad had collapsed from a heart attack. There was nothing the surgeons could do. He was gone.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW ArticleParagraph_dropcap__uIVzg\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\" data-flatplan-dropcap=\"true\"><span class=\"smallcaps\">The last\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"smallcaps\">time<\/span>\u00a0I saw him was nine days earlier. The CEO of\u00a0<i>Politico<\/i>, my employer at the time, had thrown a book party for me at his Washington manor, and Mom and Dad weren\u2019t going to miss that. They jumped in their Chevy and drove out from my childhood home in southeast Michigan. When he sauntered into the event, my old man looked out of place\u2014a rumpled midwestern minister, baggy shirt stuffed into his stained khakis\u2014but before long he was holding court with diplomats and\u00a0<i>Fortune<\/i>\u00a0500 lobbyists, making them howl with irreverent one-liners. It was like a Rodney Dangerfield flick come to life. At one point, catching sight of my agape stare, he gave an exaggerated wink, then delivered a punch line for his captive audience.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">It was the high point of my career. The book was getting lots of buzz; already I was being urged to write a sequel. Dad was proud\u2014very proud, he assured me\u2014but he was also uneasy. For months, as the book launch drew closer, he had been urging me to reconsider the focus of my reporting career. Politics, he kept saying, was a \u201csordid, nasty business,\u201d a waste of my time and God-given talents. Now, in the middle of the book party, he was taking me by the shoulder, asking a congressman to excuse us for just a moment. Dad put his arm around me and leaned in.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">\u201cYou see all these people?\u201d he asked.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">\u201cYeah.\u201d I nodded, grinning at the validation.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">\u201cMost of them won\u2019t care about you in a week,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The record scratched. My moment of rapture was interrupted. I cocked my head and smirked at him. Neither of us said anything. I was bothered. The longer we stood there in silence, the more bothered I became. Not because he was wrong. But because he was right.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">\u201cRemember,\u201d Dad said, smiling. \u201cOn this Earth, all glory is fleeting.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Now, as I raced to Reagan National Airport and boarded the first available flight to Detroit, his words echoed. There was nothing contrived about Dad\u2019s final admonition to me. That is what he believed; that is who he was.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Once a successful New York financier, Richard J. Alberta had become a born-again Christian in 1977. Despite having a nice house, beautiful wife, and healthy firstborn son, he felt a rumbling emptiness. He couldn\u2019t sleep. He developed debilitating anxiety. Religion hardly seemed like the solution; Dad came from a broken and unbelieving home. He had decided, halfway through his undergraduate studies at Rutgers University, that he was an atheist. And yet, one weekend while visiting family in the Hudson Valley, my dad agreed to attend church with his niece, Lynn. He became a new person that day. His angst was quieted. His doubts were overwhelmed. Taking Communion for the first time at Goodwill Church in Montgomery, New York, he prayed to acknowledge Jesus as the son of God and accept him as his personal savior.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Dad became unrecognizable to those who knew him. He rose early, hours before work, to read the Bible, filling a yellow legal pad with verses and annotations. He sat silently for hours in prayer. My mom thought he\u2019d lost his mind. A young journalist who worked under Howard Cosell at ABC Radio in New York, Mom was suspicious of all this Jesus talk. But her maiden name\u2014Pastor\u2014was proof of God\u2019s sense of humor. Soon she accepted Christ too.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">When Dad felt he was being called to abandon his finance career and enter the ministry, he met with Pastor Stewart Pohlman at Goodwill. As they prayed in Pastor Stew\u2019s office, Dad said he felt the spirit of the Lord swirling around him, filling up the room. He was not given to phony supernaturalism\u2014in fact, Dad might have been the most intellectually sober, reason-based Christian I\u2019ve ever known\u2014but that day, he felt certain, the Lord anointed him. Soon he and Mom were selling just about every material item they owned, leaving their high-salaried jobs in New York, and moving to Massachusetts so he could study at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">For the next two decades, they worked in small churches here and there, living off food stamps and the generosity of fellow believers. By the time I arrived, in 1986, Dad was Pastor Stew\u2019s associate at Goodwill. We lived in the church parsonage; my nursery was the library, where towers of leather-wrapped books had been collected by the church\u2019s pastors dating back to the mid-18th century. A few years later we moved to Michigan, and Dad eventually put down roots at a start-up, Cornerstone Church, in the Detroit suburb of Brighton. It was part of a minor denomination called the Evangelical Presbyterian Church (EPC), and it was there, for the next 26 years, that he served as senior pastor.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Cornerstone was our home. Because Mom also worked on staff, leading the women\u2019s ministry, I was quite literally raised in the church: playing hide-and-seek in storage areas, doing homework in the office wing, bringing high-school dates to Bible study, working as a janitor during a year of community college. I hung around the church so much that I decided to leave my mark: At 9 years old, I used a pocket knife to etch my initials into the brickwork of the narthex.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The last time I\u2019d been there, 18 months earlier, I\u2019d spoken to a packed sanctuary at Dad\u2019s retirement ceremony, armed with good-natured needling and PG-13 anecdotes. Now I would need to give a very different speech.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW ArticleParagraph_dropcap__uIVzg\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\" data-flatplan-dropcap=\"true\"><span class=\"smallcaps\">Standing in\u00a0<\/span>the back of the sanctuary, my three older brothers and I formed a receiving line. Cornerstone had been a small church when we\u2019d arrived as kids. Not anymore. Brighton, once a sleepy town situated at the intersection of two expressways, had become a prized location for commuters to Detroit and Ann Arbor. Meanwhile, Dad, with his baseball allegories and Greek-linguistics lessons, had gained a reputation for his eloquence in the pulpit. By the time I moved away, in 2008, Cornerstone had grown from a couple hundred members to a couple thousand.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Now the crowd swarmed around us, filling the sanctuary and spilling out into the lobby and adjacent hallways, where tables displayed flowers and golf clubs and photos of Dad. I was numb. My brothers too. None of us had slept much that week. So the first time someone made a glancing reference to Rush Limbaugh, it did not compute. But then another person brought him up. And then another. That\u2019s when I connected the dots. Apparently, the king of conservative talk radio had been name-checking me on his program recently\u2014\u201ca guy named Tim Alberta\u201d\u2014and describing the unflattering revelations in my book about Trump. Nothing in that moment could have mattered to me less. I smiled, shrugged, and thanked people for coming to the visitation.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"ArticlePullquote_root__z11cW\" data-flatplan-pullquote=\"true\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Here, in our house of worship, people were taunting me about politics as I tried to mourn my father.<\/span><\/aside>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">They kept on coming. More than I could count. People from the church\u2014people I\u2019d known my entire life\u2014were greeting me, not primarily with condolences or encouragement or mourning, but with commentary about Limbaugh and Trump. Some of it was playful, guys remarking about how I was the same mischief-maker they\u2019d known since kindergarten. But some of it wasn\u2019t playful. Some of it was angry; some of it was cold and confrontational. One man questioned whether I was truly a Christian. Another asked if I was still on \u201cthe right side.\u201d All while Dad was in a box a hundred feet away.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">It got to the point where I had to take a walk. Here, in our house of worship, people were taunting me about politics as I tried to mourn my father. I was in the company of certain friends that day who would not claim to know Jesus, yet they shrouded me in peace and comfort. Some of these card-carrying evangelical Christians? Not so much. They didn\u2019t see a hurting son; they saw a vulnerable adversary.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">That night, while fine-tuning the eulogy I would give at Dad\u2019s funeral the following afternoon, I still felt the sting. My wife perceived as much. The unflappable one in the family, she encouraged me to be careful with my words and cautioned against mentioning the day\u2019s unpleasantness. I took half of her advice.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">In front of an overflow crowd on August 2, 2019, I paid tribute to the man who\u2019d taught me everything\u2014how to throw a baseball, how to be a gentleman, how to trust and love the Lord. Reciting my favorite verse, from Paul\u2019s second letter to the early Church in Corinth, Greece, I told of Dad\u2019s instruction to keep our eyes fixed on what we could not see. Reading from his favorite poem, about a man named Richard Cory, I told of Dad\u2019s warning that we could amass great wealth and still be poor.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Then I recounted all the people who\u2019d approached me the day before, wanting to discuss the Trump wars on AM talk radio. I proposed that their time in the car would be better spent listening to Dad\u2019s old sermons. I spoke of the need for discipleship and spiritual formation. I suggested, with some sarcasm, that if they needed help finding biblical listening for their daily commute, the pastors here on staff could help. \u201cWhy are you listening to\u00a0<i>Rush Limbaugh\u200a<\/i>?\u201d I asked my father\u2019s congregation. \u201cGarbage in, garbage out.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">There was nervous laughter in the sanctuary. Some people were visibly agitated. Others looked away, pretending not to hear. My dad\u2019s successor, a young pastor named Chris Winans, wore a shell-shocked expression. No matter. I had said my piece. It was finished. Or so I thought.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">A few hours later, after we had buried Dad, my brothers and I slumped down onto the couches in our parents\u2019 living room. We opened some beers and turned on a baseball game. Behind us, in the kitchen, a small platoon of church ladies worked to prepare a meal for the family.\u00a0<i>Here<\/i>, I thought,<i>\u00a0is the love of Christ<\/i>. Watching them hustle about, comforting Mom and catering to her sons, I found myself regretting the Limbaugh remark. Most of the folks at our church were humble, kindhearted Christians like these women. Maybe I\u2019d blown things out of proportion.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Just then, one of them walked over and handed me an envelope. It had been left at the church, she said. My name was scrawled across it. I opened the envelope. Inside was a full-page-long, handwritten screed. It was from a longtime Cornerstone elder, someone my dad had called a friend, a man who\u2019d mentored me in the youth group and had known me for most of my life.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">He had composed this note, on the occasion of my father\u2019s death, to express just how disappointed he was in me. I was part of an evil plot, the man wrote, to undermine God\u2019s ordained leader of the United States. My criticisms of President Trump were tantamount to treason\u2014against both God and country\u2014and I should be ashamed of myself.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">However, there was still hope. Jesus forgives, and so could this man. If I used my journalism skills to investigate the \u201cdeep state,\u201d he wrote, uncovering the shadowy cabal that was supposedly sabotaging Trump\u2019s presidency, then I would be restored. He said he was praying for me.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">I felt sick. Silently, I passed the letter to my wife. She scanned it without expression. Then she flung the piece of paper into the air and, with a shriek that made the church ladies jump out of their cardigans, cried out: \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with these people?\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW ArticleParagraph_dropcap__uIVzg\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\" data-flatplan-dropcap=\"true\"><span class=\"smallcaps\">There has\u00a0<\/span>never been consensus on what, exactly, it means to be an evangelical. Competing and overlapping definitions have been offered for generations, some more widely embraced than others. Billy Graham, a man synonymous with the term,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/12\/evangelical-christian\/418236\/\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">once remarked<\/a>\u00a0that he himself would like to inquire as to its true meaning. By the 1980s, thanks to the efforts of televangelists and political activists, what was once a religious signifier began transforming into a partisan movement.\u00a0<i>Evangelical<\/i>\u00a0soon became synonymous with\u00a0<i>conservative Christian<\/i>, and eventually with\u00a0<i>white conservative Republican<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p id=\"injected-recirculation-link-2\" class=\"ArticleRelatedContentLink_root__VYc9V\" data-view-action=\"view link - injected link - item 3\" data-event-element=\"injected link\" data-event-position=\"3\" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_217=\"52587\" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_217=\"100\" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_217=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/12\/evangelical-christian\/418236\/\">Read: Defining\u00a0<em>evangelical<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">My dad, a serious theologian who held advanced degrees from top seminaries, bristled at reductive analyses of his religious tribe. He would frequently state from the pulpit what\u00a0<i>he<\/i>\u00a0believed an evangelical to be: someone who interprets the Bible as the inspired word of God and who takes seriously the charge to proclaim it to the world.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">From a young age, I realized that not all Christians were like my dad. Other adults who went to our church\u2014my teachers, coaches, friends\u2019 parents\u2014didn\u2019t speak about God the way that he did. Theirs was a more casual Christianity, less a lifestyle than a hobby, something that could be picked up and put down and slotted into schedules. Their pastor realized as much. Pushing his people ever harder to engage with questions of canonical authority and trinitarian precepts and Calvinist doctrine, Dad tried his best to run a serious church.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ArticleInlineImageFigure_root__syFcM ArticleInlineImageFigure_alignWell__nNzJs\" data-flatplan-inline_image=\"true\">\n<figure class=\"ArticleInlineImageFigure_figure__7yRj_\"><picture class=\"ArticleInlineImageFigure_picture__pd0Rz ArticleInlineImageFigure_loaded__wXw_H\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"Image_root__XxsOp Image_lazy__hYWHV Image_loaded__zmzJ7 ArticleInlineImageFigure_image__ARDJL\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.theatlantic.com\/thumbor\/8PRiuayCcDSspaxfLgosiwipeIY=\/0x0:1600x1007\/655x412\/media\/img\/posts\/2023\/11\/Alberta_2\/original.png\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 729px) 655px, (min-width: 576px) calc(100vw - 48px), 100vw\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn.theatlantic.com\/thumbor\/8PRiuayCcDSspaxfLgosiwipeIY=\/0x0:1600x1007\/655x412\/media\/img\/posts\/2023\/11\/Alberta_2\/original.png 655w, https:\/\/cdn.theatlantic.com\/thumbor\/uXhO21E8kamWNy0pU4jDqt_dHiY=\/0x0:1600x1007\/750x472\/media\/img\/posts\/2023\/11\/Alberta_2\/original.png 750w, https:\/\/cdn.theatlantic.com\/thumbor\/2e7fKDVrYJpyFJv3jpnBR2zV_4Q=\/0x0:1600x1007\/850x535\/media\/img\/posts\/2023\/11\/Alberta_2\/original.png 850w, https:\/\/cdn.theatlantic.com\/thumbor\/jF862n652Qc77HShIQLkgnYX-t0=\/0x0:1600x1007\/928x584\/media\/img\/posts\/2023\/11\/Alberta_2\/original.png 928w, https:\/\/cdn.theatlantic.com\/thumbor\/F1oMFSkmIC1pBuKNqOMk1M5rCFY=\/0x0:1600x1007\/1310x824\/media\/img\/posts\/2023\/11\/Alberta_2\/original.png 1310w\" alt=\"photo of younger and older man smiling with arms around each other in front of brick wall and door\" width=\"655\" height=\"412\" \/><\/picture><figcaption class=\"ArticleInlineImageFigure_caption__tDIdT ArticleInlineImageFigure_alignWell__nNzJs\">The author and his father in 2019 (Courtesy of Tim Alberta)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">But for all his successes, Dad had one great weakness. Pastor Alberta\u2019s kryptonite as a Christian\u2014and I think he knew it, though he never admitted it to me\u2014was his intense love of country.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Once a talented young athlete, Dad came down with tuberculosis at 16 years old. He was hospitalized for four months; at one point, doctors thought he might die. He eventually recovered, and with the Vietnam War escalating, he joined the Marine Corps. But at the Officer Candidates School in Quantico, Virginia, he fell behind in the physical work. His lungs were not healthy. After receiving an honorable discharge, Dad went home saddled with a certain shame. In the ensuing years, he learned that dozens of the second lieutenants he\u2019d trained alongside at Quantico\u2014as well as a bunch of guys he\u2019d grown up with\u2014were killed in action. It burdened him for the rest of his life.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">This experience, and his disgust with the hippies and the drug culture and the war protesters, turned Dad into a law-and-order conservative. Marinating in the language of social conservatism during his time in seminary\u2014this was the heyday of the Moral Majority\u2014he emerged a full-spectrum Republican. His biggest political concern was abortion; in 1947, my grandmother, trapped in an emotionally abusive marriage, had almost ended her pregnancy with him. (She had a sudden change of heart at the clinic and walked out, a decision my dad would always attribute to holy intercession.) But he also waded into the culture wars: gay marriage, education curriculum, morality in public life.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Dad always told us that personal integrity was a prerequisite for political leadership. He was so relieved when Bill Clinton\u2019s second term ended that he and Mom hosted a small viewing party in our living room for George W. Bush\u2019s 2001 inauguration, to celebrate the return of morality to the White House. Over time, however, his emphasis shifted. One Sunday in early 2010, when I was home visiting, he showed the congregation an ominous video in which Christian leaders warned about the menace of Obamacare. I told him afterward that it felt inappropriate for a worship service; he disagreed. We would butt heads more regularly in the years that followed. It was always loving, always respectful. Yet clearly our philosophical paths were diverging\u2014a reality that became unavoidable during the presidency of Donald Trump.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Dad would have preferred any of the other Republicans who ran in 2016. He knew that Trump was a narcissist and a liar; he knew that he was not a moral man. Ultimately Dad felt he had no choice but to support the Republican ticket, given his concern for the unborn and the Supreme Court majority that hung in the balance. I understood that decision. What I couldn\u2019t understand was how, over the next couple of years, he became an apologist for Trump\u2019s antics, dismissing criticisms of the president\u2019s conduct as little more than an attempt to marginalize his supporters. Dad really did believe this; he believed that the constant attacks on Trump\u2019s character were ipso facto an attack on the character of people like himself, which I think, on some subconscious level, created a permission structure for him to ignore the president\u2019s depravity. All I could do was tell Dad the truth. \u201cLook, you\u2019re the one who taught me to know right from wrong,\u201d I would say. \u201cDon\u2019t be mad at me for acting on it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">To his credit, Dad was not some lazy, knee-jerk partisan. He was vocal about certain issues\u2014gun violence, poverty, immigration, the trappings of wealth\u2014that did not play to his constituency at Cornerstone.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Dad wasn\u2019t a Christian nationalist; he wanted nothing to do with theocracy. He just believed that God had blessed the United States uniquely\u2014and felt that anyone who fought to preserve those blessings was doing the Lord\u2019s work. This made for an unfortunate scene in 2007, when a young congregant at Cornerstone, a Marine named Mark Kidd, died during a fourth tour of duty in Iraq. Public opinion had swung sharply against the war, and Democrats were demanding that the Bush administration bring the troops home. My dad was devastated by Kidd\u2019s death. They had corresponded while Kidd was overseas and met for prayer in between his deployments. Dad\u2019s grief as a pastor gave way to his grievance as a Republican supporter of the war: He made it known to local Democratic politicians that they weren\u2019t welcome at the funeral.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">\u201cI am ashamed, personally, of leaders who say they support the troops but not the commander in chief,\u201d Dad thundered from his pulpit, earning a raucous standing ovation. \u201cDo they not see that discourages the warriors and encourages the terrorists?\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">This touched off a firestorm in our community. Most of the church members were all for Dad\u2019s remarks, but even in a conservative town like Brighton, plenty of people felt uneasy about turning a fallen Marine\u2019s church memorial into a partisan political rally. Patriotism in the pulpit is one thing; lots of sanctuaries fly an American flag on the rostrum. This was something else. This was taking the weight and the gravity and the eternal certainty of God and lending it to an ephemeral and questionable cause. This was rebuking people for failing to unconditionally follow the president of the United States when the only authority we\u2019re meant to unconditionally follow\u2014particularly in a setting of stained-glass windows\u2014is Christ himself.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">I know Dad regretted it. But he couldn\u2019t help himself. His own personal story\u2014and his broader view of the United States as a godly nation, a source of hope in a despondent world\u2014was impossible to divorce from his pastoral ministry. Every time a member of the military came to church dressed in uniform, Dad would recognize them by name, ask them to stand up, and lead the church in a rapturous round of applause. This was one of the first things his successor changed at Cornerstone.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW ArticleParagraph_dropcap__uIVzg\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\" data-flatplan-dropcap=\"true\"><span class=\"smallcaps\">Eighteen months\u00a0<\/span>after Dad\u2019s funeral, in February 2021, I sat down across from that successor, Chris Winans, in a booth at the Brighton Bar &amp; Grill. It\u2019s a comfortable little haunt on Main Street, backing up to a wooden playground and a millpond. But Winans didn\u2019t look comfortable. He looked nervous, even a bit paranoid, glancing around him as we began to speak. Soon, I would understand why.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Dad had spent years looking for an heir apparent. Several associate pastors had come and gone. Cornerstone was his life\u2019s work\u2014he had led the church throughout virtually its entire history\u2014so there would be no settling in his search for a successor. The uncertainty wore him down. Dad worried that he might never find the right guy. And then one day, while attending a denominational meeting, he met Winans, a young associate pastor from Goodwill\u2014the very church where he\u2019d been saved, and where he\u2019d worked his first job out of seminary. Dad hired him away from Goodwill to lead a young-adults ministry at Cornerstone, and from the moment Winans arrived, I could tell that he was the one.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Barely 30 years old, Winans looked to be exactly what Cornerstone needed in its next generation of leadership. He was a brilliant student of the scriptures. He spoke with precision and clarity from the pulpit. He had a humble, easygoing way about him, operating without the outsize ego that often accompanies first-rate preaching. Everything about this pastor\u2014the boyish sweep of brown hair, his delightful young family\u2014seemed to be straight out of central casting.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">There was just one problem: Chris Winans was not a conservative Republican. He didn\u2019t like guns. He cared more about funding anti-poverty programs than cutting taxes. He had no appetite for President Trump\u2019s unrepentant antics. Of course, none of this would seem heretical to Christians in other parts of the world; given his staunch anti-abortion position, Winans would in most places be considered the picture of spiritual and intellectual consistency. But in the American evangelical tradition, and at a church like Cornerstone, the whiff of liberalism made him suspect.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Trump warned that, as president, Biden would \u201churt God\u201d and target Christians for their religious beliefs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Dad knew the guy was different. Winans liked to play piano instead of sports, and had no taste for hunting or fishing. Frankly, Dad thought that was a bonus. Winans wasn\u2019t supposed to simply placate Cornerstone\u2019s aging base of wealthy white congregants. The new pastor\u2019s charge was to evangelize, to cast a vision and expand the mission field, to challenge those inside the church and carry the gospel to those outside it. Dad didn\u2019t think there was undue risk. He felt confident that his hand-chosen successor\u2019s gifts in the pulpit, and his manifest love of Jesus, would smooth over any bumps in the transition.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">He was wrong. Almost immediately after Winans moved into the role of senior pastor, at the beginning of 2018, the knives came out. Any errant remark he made about politics or culture, any slight against Trump or the Republican Party\u2014real or perceived\u2014invited a torrent of criticism. Longtime members would demand a meeting with Dad, who had stuck around in a support role, and unload on Winans. Dad would ask if there was any substantive criticism of the theology; almost invariably, the answer was no. A month into the job, when Winans remarked in a sermon that Christians ought to be protective of God\u2019s creation\u2014arguing for congregants to take seriously the threats to the planet\u2014people came to Dad by the dozens, outraged, demanding that Winans be reined in. Dad told them all to get lost. If anyone had a beef with the senior pastor, he said, they needed to take it up with the senior pastor. (Dad did so himself, buying Winans lunch at Chili\u2019s and suggesting that he tone down the tree hugging.)<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Winans had a tough first year on the job, but he survived it. The people at Cornerstone were in an adjustment period. He needed to respect that\u2014and he needed to adjust, too. As long as Dad had his back, Winans knew he would be okay.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">And then Dad died.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Now, Winans told me, he was barely hanging on at Cornerstone. The church\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/magazine\/archive\/2022\/06\/evangelical-church-pastors-political-radicalization\/629631\/\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">had become unruly<\/a>; his job had become unbearable. Not long after Dad died\u2014making Winans the unquestioned leader of the church\u2014the coronavirus pandemic arrived. And then George Floyd was murdered. All of this as Donald Trump campaigned for reelection. Trump had run in 2016 on a promise that \u201cChristianity will have power\u201d if he won the White House; now he was warning that his opponent in the 2020 election, former Vice President Joe Biden, was going to \u201churt God\u201d and target Christians for their religious beliefs. Embracing dark rhetoric and violent conspiracy theories, the president enlisted prominent evangelicals to help frame a cosmic spiritual clash between the God-fearing Republicans who supported Trump and the secular leftists who were plotting their conquest of America\u2019s Judeo-Christian ethos.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">People at Cornerstone began confronting their pastor, demanding that he speak out against government mandates and Black Lives Matter and Joe Biden. When Winans declined, people left. The mood soured noticeably after Trump\u2019s defeat in November 2020. A crusade to overturn the election result, led by a group of outspoken Christians\u2014including Trump\u2019s lawyer Jenna Ellis, who later pleaded guilty to a felony charge of aiding and abetting false statements and writings, and the author Eric Metaxas, who suggested to fellow believers that martyrdom might be required to keep Trump in office\u2014roiled the Cornerstone congregation. When a popular church staffer who had been known to proselytize for QAnon was fired after repeated run-ins with Winans, the pastor told me, the departures came in droves. Some of those abandoning Cornerstone were not core congregants. But plenty of them were. They were people who served in leadership roles, people Winans counted as confidants and friends.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">By the time Trump supporters invaded the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, Winans believed he\u2019d lost control of his church. \u201cIt\u2019s an exodus,\u201d he told me a few weeks later, sitting inside Brighton Bar &amp; Grill.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The pastor had felt despair\u2014and a certain liability\u2014watching the attack unfold on television. Christian imagery was ubiquitous: rioters forming prayer circles, singing hymns, carrying Bibles and crosses. The perversion of America\u2019s prevailing religion would forever be associated with this tragedy; as one of the legislative ringleaders, Senator Josh Hawley, explained\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FH-FWfDupbw\" data-event-element=\"inline link\">in a speech the following year<\/a>, long after the blood had been scrubbed from the Capitol steps, \u201cWe are a revolutionary nation precisely because we are the heirs of the revolution of the Bible.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">That sort of thinking, Winans said, represents an even greater threat than the events of January 6.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW ArticleParagraph_dropcap__uIVzg\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\" data-flatplan-dropcap=\"true\"><span class=\"smallcaps\">\u201cA lot <\/span>of people believe there was a religious conception of this country. A biblical conception of this country,\u201d Winans told me. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the source of a lot of our problems.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">For much of American history, white Christians have enjoyed tremendous wealth and influence and security. Given that reality\u2014and given the miraculous nature of America\u2019s defeat of Great Britain, its rise to superpower status, and its legacy of spreading freedom and democracy (and, yes, Christianity) across the globe\u2014it\u2019s easy to see why so many evangelicals believe that our country is divinely blessed. The problem is, blessings often become indistinguishable from entitlements. Once we become convinced that God has blessed something, that something can become an object of jealousy, obsession\u2014even worship.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">\u201cAt its root, we\u2019re talking about idolatry. America has become an idol to some of these people. If you believe that God is in covenant with America, then you believe\u2014and I\u2019ve heard lots of people say this explicitly\u2014that we\u2019re a new Israel,\u201d Winans said, referring to the Old Testament narrative of God\u2019s chosen nation. \u201cYou believe the sorts of promises made to Israel are applicable to this country; you view America as a covenant that needs to be protected. You have to fight for America as if salvation itself hangs in the balance. At that point, you understand yourself as an American first and most fundamentally. And that is a terrible misunderstanding of who we\u2019re called to be.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Plenty of nations are mentioned in the Bible; the United States is not one of them. Most American evangelicals are sophisticated enough to reject the idea of this country as something consecrated in the eyes of God. But many of those same people have chosen to idealize a\u00a0<i>Christian America<\/i>\u00a0that puts them at odds with\u00a0<i>Christianity<\/i>. They have allowed their national identity to shape their faith identity instead of the other way around.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Winans chose to be hypervigilant on this front, hence the change of policy regarding Cornerstone\u2019s salute to military personnel. The new pastor would meet soldiers after the service, shaking their hand and individually thanking them for their service. But he refused to stage an ovation in the sanctuary. This wasn\u2019t because he was some bohemian anti-war activist; in fact, his wife had served in the Army. Winans simply felt it was inappropriate.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">\u201cI don\u2019t want to dishonor anyone. I think nations have the right to self-defense. I respect the sacrifices these people make in the military,\u201d Winans told me. \u201cBut they would come in wearing their dress blues and get this wild standing ovation. And you contrast that to whenever we would host missionaries: They would stand up for recognition, and we give them a golf clap \u2026 And you have to wonder: Why? What\u2019s going on inside our hearts?\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">This kind of cultural heresy was getting Winans into trouble. More congregants were defecting each week. Many were relocating to one particular congregation down the road, a revival-minded church that was pandering to the whims of the moment, led by a pastor who was preaching a blood-and-soil Christian nationalism that sought to merge two kingdoms into one.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">As we talked, Winans asked me to keep something between us: He was thinking about leaving Cornerstone.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The \u201cpsychological onslaught,\u201d he said, had become too much. Recently, the pastor had developed a form of anxiety disorder and was retreating into a dark room between services to collect himself. Winans had met with several trusted elders and asked them to stick close to him on Sunday mornings so they could catch him if he were to faint and fall over.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">I thought about Dad and how heartbroken he would have been. Then I started to wonder if Dad didn\u2019t have some level of culpability in all of this. Clearly, long before COVID-19 or George Floyd or Donald Trump, something had gone wrong at Cornerstone. I had always shrugged off the crude, hysterical, sky-is-falling Facebook posts I would see from people at the church. I found it amusing, if not particularly alarming, that some longtime Cornerstone members were obsessed with trolling me on Twitter. Now I couldn\u2019t help but think these were warnings\u2014bright-red blinking lights\u2014that should have been taken seriously. My dad never had a social-media account. Did he have any idea just how lost some of his sheep really were?<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">I had never told Winans about the confrontations at my dad\u2019s viewing, or the letter I received after taking Rush Limbaugh\u2019s name in vain at the funeral. Now I was leaning across the table, unloading every detail. He narrowed his eyes and folded his hands and gave a pained exhale, mouthing that he was sorry. He could not even manage the words.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">We both kept quiet for a little while. And then I asked him something I\u2019d thought about every day for the previous 18 months\u2014a sanitized version of my wife\u2019s outburst in the living room.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with American evangelicals?\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Winans thought for a moment.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">\u201cAmerica,\u201d he replied. \u201cToo many of them worship America.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/article>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>THE LAST TEMPTATION &#8212; How evangelicals, once culturally confident became an anxious minority seeking political protection from the least traditionally religious president in living memory. by Michael Gerson Atlantic April 2018 One of the most extraordinary things about our current &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2018\/06\/23\/evangelicals-have-become-hypocrits\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-9761","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-uncategorized"],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p2Ncip-2xr","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/9761","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=9761"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/9761\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":19314,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/9761\/revisions\/19314"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=9761"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=9761"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=9761"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
