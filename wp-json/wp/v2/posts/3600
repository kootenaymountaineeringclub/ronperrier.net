WINE<\/strong><br \/>\nOne of the things that separates kayak trips from other backcountry adventures is you can bring more fresh food and wine! Avoid breakable bottles \u2013 use wineskins or boxed wines (discard box and bring only bladder). Think about the flavours, taste and texture of food to pair with the wind.<br \/>\nMatch high-acid food (goat cheese, oranges, lemons, tomatoes, vinegar) with high-acid wine: Sauvignon Blanc, some styles of Chardonnay, Gew\u00fcrtztraminer, Pinot Noir, Riesling and Zinfandel.<br \/>\nContrast spicy, salty\/smoked and heavily seasoned dishes (curries and Mexican) with lighter, fruity wines: Gamay Beaujolais, Gew\u00fcrztraminer, Johannesburg Riesling, Pinot Noir, Sauvignon Blanc and lighter types of Zinfandel. <\/p>\n<p><strong>2.

The wizards at Pat\u2019s Backcountry Beverages have brought this struggle to its end. You need a carbonator bottle, an activator packet, a source of water and one of their brew concentrates (so far, they have a Pale Rail Pale Ale and a Black Hops Black IPA). For just 12.3oz of weight in your pack, you\u2019ll have a pint of beer \u2013 each brew concentrate packet only weights 2.1oz and each activator packet only weights .4oz \u2013 those together equal another full pint of beer. Carbonating the beer in the backcountry your first time around can be a bit challenging, so I would definitely recommend practicing at home a of couple times first. It is a taste that\u2019s a bit different from your local bar\u2019s pint.<br \/>\nTotally packable, nearly zero waste, this lightweight backpacking beer is one small step for mankind and one giant leap for backpacking beer lovers.<br \/>\nTotal Weight: 12.3oz (Carbonator bottle + one packet brew concentrate + one activator packet).

Still, there\u2019s nothing quite like your favorite ale in the backcountry. Yes, you\u2019re still humping a six pack while you hike, but the aluminum cans cut weight, are easier to pack out and chill easily in water. Two Beers also utilizes a plastic pop off ring system.

Because of its shape, it fits well in the outside water bottle pocket of your pack. It\u2019s also a decently good tasting wine. The chardonnay is your better bet out of the two.
