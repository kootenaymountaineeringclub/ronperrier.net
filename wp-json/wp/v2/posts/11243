Founded by the Celtic Scordisci in 279 BC, the city would serve as the birthplace of three Roman emperors: Constantine the Great, the first Christian emperor and the founder of Constantinople; Constantius III; and Justin I.

It is a great white plaster church dating from the 1850s with a 1937 bell tower and a large central dome surrounded by 4 smaller domes. The inside is completely frescoed in rich colours. The mammoth carved wood iconostasis with 48 icons is a highlight. Free<br \/>\n<strong>University of Ni\u0161 building<\/strong>.

It was constructed following the Battle of \u010cegar of May 1809, during the First Serbian Uprising. Serbian rebels under the command of Stevan Sin\u0111eli\u0107 were attacked by the Ottomans on \u010cegar Hill, near Ni\u0161. Knowing that he and his fighters would be impaled if captured, Sin\u0111eli\u0107 detonated a powder magazine within the rebel entrenchment, killing himself, his fellow rebels and the encroaching Ottoman soldiers. Vizier Hurshid Pasha ordered that a tower be made from the skulls of the fallen rebels. The tower is 4.5 metres (15\u00a0ft) high, and originally contained 952 skulls embedded on four sides in 14 rows.<br \/>\nFollowing the Ottoman withdrawal from Ni\u0161 in 1878, the tower was roofed over, and in 1892 a chapel was built around it. In 1937, the chapel was renovated. A bust of Sin\u0111eli\u0107 was added the following year. In 1948, Skull Tower and the chapel enclosing it were declared Cultural Monuments of Exceptional Importance and came under the protection of the Socialist Republic of Serbia. Further renovation of the chapel occurred again in 1989.<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiN-vTnvcbiAhXSsKQKHaMiD-kQjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gpsmycity.com%2Fblog%2Fthe-skull-tower-in-nis--serbia-(cele-kula)-119.html&amp;psig=AOvVaw2Q2HTqfijo9grc7iN0GqHV&amp;ust=1559416383515423\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-cthref=\"\/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiN-vTnvcbiAhXSsKQKHaMiD-kQjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gpsmycity.com%2Fblog%2Fthe-skull-tower-in-nis--serbia-(cele-kula)-119.html&amp;psig=AOvVaw2Q2HTqfijo9grc7iN0GqHV&amp;ust=1559416383515423\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwiN-vTnvcbiAhXSsKQKHaMiD-kQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/www.gpsmycity.com\/img\/adp\/119.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for SKULL TOWER SERBIA\" width=\"640\" height=\"375\" data-iml=\"1559330241156\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;ved=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Feurope%2Fcomments%2F8ja3tr%2F%25C5%25BEele_kula_skull_tower_in_ni%25C5%25A1_serbia_it_was_built%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw2Q2HTqfijo9grc7iN0GqHV&amp;ust=1559416383515423\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-cthref=\"\/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;ved=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Feurope%2Fcomments%2F8ja3tr%2F%25C5%25BEele_kula_skull_tower_in_ni%25C5%25A1_serbia_it_was_built%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw2Q2HTqfijo9grc7iN0GqHV&amp;ust=1559416383515423\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwiIr5ivvsbiAhUJsaQKHYCBAHEQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/e5u575zpirx01.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for SKULL TOWER SERBIA\" width=\"674\" height=\"398\" data-iml=\"1559330390517\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjIypbKvsbiAhUCDOwKHUQOBuMQjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.inyourpocket.com%2Fnis%2FThe-Skull-Tower_59816v&amp;psig=AOvVaw2Q2HTqfijo9grc7iN0GqHV&amp;ust=1559416383515423\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-cthref=\"\/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjIypbKvsbiAhUCDOwKHUQOBuMQjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.inyourpocket.com%2Fnis%2FThe-Skull-Tower_59816v&amp;psig=AOvVaw2Q2HTqfijo9grc7iN0GqHV&amp;ust=1559416383515423\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwjIypbKvsbiAhUCDOwKHUQOBuMQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/s.inyourpocket.com\/gallery\/1427.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for SKULL TOWER SERBIA\" width=\"596\" height=\"398\" data-iml=\"1559330447289\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjwnIvkvsbiAhVS46QKHb10DkkQjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.upoznajsrbiju.rs%2Fen%2Fthroughout-eastern-serbia%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw2Q2HTqfijo9grc7iN0GqHV&amp;ust=1559416383515423\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-cthref=\"\/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjwnIvkvsbiAhVS46QKHb10DkkQjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.upoznajsrbiju.rs%2Fen%2Fthroughout-eastern-serbia%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw2Q2HTqfijo9grc7iN0GqHV&amp;ust=1559416383515423\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwjwnIvkvsbiAhVS46QKHb10DkkQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"http:\/\/www.upoznajsrbiju.rs\/wp-content\/uploads\/%C4%86ele-Kula-Sindjeli%C4%87-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"597\" height=\"398\" data-iml=\"1559330501352\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nAs of 2013, 58 skulls remain on the tower.

It was lived in during medieval times.<br \/>\nGalerius (305-311 AD) was born from a peasant family in Dacia Ripensis (Serbia) south of the Danube. He rose through the ranks of the army until appointed Caesaar in the first tetrarchy. On Docletian\u2019s abdication he became Emperor and built an imperial palace-circus complex and a mausoleum in Thessoloniki, the imperial capital in Northern Greece.
