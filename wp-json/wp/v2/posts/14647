Mauritius also controls\u00a0Rodrigues\u00a0Island and the remote, sparsely populated Agalega and Cargados Garayos (Saint Brandon) islands.<\/p>\n<p><strong>History. <\/strong>The island of Mauritius was first discovered by Arab sailors, at some time in the 9th century when it was uninhabited and covered in a dense forest. The first to colonise the island were the Dutch in 1598 in Grand Port. Mauritius was named after the Prince of Holland Mauritz de Nassau.<br \/>\nIn 1710, the Dutch abandoned the island, leaving behind macaques, the java deer, sugar cane, fugitive slaves and, also, an irreversible damage to the endemic and indigenous flora and fauna of the island &#8211; the Dodo was, by then, extinct due to extensive hunting, the bird being very easy to capture, while the once abundant black ebony tree population was almost completely depleted due to over-exploitation for its timber.<br \/>\nThe French settled on the island in 1713, also landing at the bay in the south-east. They renamed the bay Port Bourbon and renamed the island\u00a0Ile de France. They settled on the north-western side of the island and established their main harbour there, Port Louis, the present-day capital of Mauritius. During the French settlement there was a lot of development in the country. Mah\u00e9 de Labourdonnais , whose statue can be seen across from the harbour in Port Louis, is known as the founder of the capital city and the island prospered under his governance (1735-1746).<br \/>\nIn 1810, the British defeated the French, renamed Mauritius and remained under British rule until it attained independence. In 1835, slavery was officially abolished and, as most of the African slaves chose to abandon the agricultural fields and move to small coastal villages, indentured labourers (coolies) were brought in from India (chiefly from Tamil Nadu &amp; Bihar) to work in the growing sugarcane industry.<br \/>\nIn 1968, Mauritius became an independent nation within the Commonwealth.<br \/>\nA stable democracy with regular free elections and a positive human rights record, Mauritius has attracted considerable foreign investment and has one of Africa&#8217;s highest per capita incomes.<br \/>\n<strong>Climate. <\/strong>Tropical, modified by southeast trade winds; warm, dry winter (May to November); hot, wet, humid summer (November to May). Tropical cyclones (November to April<\/p>\n<p><strong>GET IN<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Visas.<\/strong> Most do not need to apply for a visa beforehand and, depending on nationality, are either entitled to a 90-day visa-free stay or a visa on arrival valid for either 60 or 14 days.<br \/>\n<strong>By plane. <\/strong>The\u00a0Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport at Plaisance in the southeast of the island. Air Mauritius\u00a0is the home carrier and operates a network of routes to the local islands and to international destinations in Africa, Australia, Europe and Asia.<br \/>\nRegional airlines: Air Austral, Air Madgascar,\u00a0and Air Seychelles\u00a0connect Mauritius with the surrounding islands.<br \/>\nInternational airlines such as Air France, Turkish Airlines, Emirates, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Condor, South African Airways, Meridiana\u00a0and Corsairfly\u00a0all serve Mauritius from their home bases.<br \/>\nVisitors are required to provide accommodation details to the immigration service on arrival.<br \/>\n<strong>By sea. <\/strong>Vessels that arrive at the port are mainly cargo ships. The Mauritius Pride and the Trochetia are the Mauritian vessels that usually sail to and from\u00a0Reunion\u00a0Island, Rodrigues Island and\u00a0Madagascar. Costa Cruises ships have recently started an Indian Ocean cruise including a visit to Mauritius.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GET AROUND<br \/>\n<\/strong>Bus and taxi services are best used in urban areas. Bicycles and motorbikes are also available for hire.<br \/>\n<strong>By plane. <\/strong>Air Mauritius\u00a0operates daily flights connecting Plaisance Airport and Rodrigues (flight time &#8211; 1 hour 15 minutes).<br \/>\n<strong>By car. <\/strong>One major highway runs north to south, otherwise a good network of paved, if sometimes narrow, roads cover the island.

Curepipe 0:20, Grand Baie, North 0:30, Mahebourg, Southeast 0:45, Flic-en-Flac, West 0:30<br \/>\n<strong>By bus. <\/strong>The bus is the most economical way of travelling.<br \/>\n<strong>By metered taxi. <\/strong>Taxis are the best way to visit the island. Various tours are available from MUR2500<br \/>\n<strong>By tram. <\/strong>A single light rail line known as the\u00a0Metro Express links Port Louis with Rose Hill, with an extension to Curepipe.<br \/>\n<strong>By boat. <\/strong>Coraline sureka.toolooa@coraline.intnet.muz sails once a week to Rodrigues Island and Reunion island from Port Louis.
