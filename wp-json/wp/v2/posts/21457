TRAVEL WITHOUT FLYING<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">a. <strong>Graham Hughes.<\/strong>\u00a0In 2009, this 33-year-old British man was the first person to visit all 201 countries (193 UN members plus Taiwan, Vatican City, Palestine, Kosovo, Western Sahara, and the four home nations of The United Kingdom) without using a plane. He used buses, taxis, trains, and longer-haul voyages mostly by hitching lifts on cargo ships and his own two feet to travel 160,000 miles in exactly 1,426 days \u2013 all on a shoestring of just $100 a week. North Korea, Iraq, and Afghanistan were the easy ones \u2013 far tougher were getting to tiny island nations like Nauru, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the Maldives, and the Seychelles where there were sometimes pirate threats.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cI love to travel, and I guess my reason for doing it was I wanted to see if this could be done, by one person travelling on a shoestring. I think I also wanted to show that the world is not some big, scary place, but in fact, is full of people who want to help you even if you are a stranger.\u201d He raised money for the charity WaterAid.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Unfortunately, Graham&#8217;s amazing journey has been denigrated by some as he flew home and returned to the departing country twice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">b.<strong> Torbj\u00f8rn Pedersen<\/strong> (aka Thor, he called the project \u2018Once Upon a Saga\u2019) finished his quest to visit 203 countries in May 2023 in an unbroken journey without flying. He spent at least 24 hours in each country, with an average time of 17 days. Although initially planned to take 4 years, this took him almost 10 years, due to unforeseen challenges such as visa issues, political unrest, and the COVID-19 pandemic. During the adventure, he got married and saw his goal slip beyond his grasp due to pandemic travel restrictions when he spent three years in Hong Kong.<br \/>\nHe had three cardinal rules: absolutely no flying, staying in each country for a minimum of 24 hours, and no returning home until visiting the final country. The three semi-mandatory sub-rules: not paying any bribes, sticking to a budget of roughly $20 a day, and never eating at McDonalds.<br \/>\nPedersen set off in October 2013 when the iPhone 5 was the latest model being marketed. He took more than 300 long-distance buses, over 200 trains, 40 container ships, shared motorcycle taxis, and a high-performance yacht, sometimes having to backtrack due to illness, visa delays, or conflict.<br \/>\n\u201cI depleted my personal funds, sold some possessions, and took out two loans. A few years in, I found that what used to be 1% work and 99% fun had turned to 99% work.\u201d His three cardinal rules seemed innocent at first but created a mental prison for him as the years went on. \u201cFour years turned to five, then six, then seven, and then a global pandemic broke out when I was just missing nine more countries. I finally reached the last country and returned home after nearly a decade. You\u2019d have to be a certifiable nutcase to do a thing like that,\u201d Pedersen says. His now-wife came to visit him 27 times.<br \/>\nThe most complicated was the Panama-Colombia border, Saudi Arabia would not accept overland travel and\u00a0entering Equatorial Guinea required visiting 5-6 EG embassies and the borders closed during Covid.\u00a0Besides the usual 195, he also went to Kosovo, Western Sahara, and Taiwan.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\n2. YOUNGEST TO 193<br \/>\n<\/strong>a.<strong> Henrik Jeppersen<em>,<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0From Denmark, In 2016, at 27 years old, he became the youngest to see all 193 (Eritrea), and 30 when he finished all FIFA countries. He travels alone, very light and low-cost \u2013 staying with local people, getting hotels and flights sponsored, hitchhiking (done more than 1,000 times), avoiding restaurants and instead buying food at supermarkets, and using low-cost airlines or buses.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Most difficult travel \u2013 Africa with bad infrastructure, pollution, dusty roads, corruption and safety concerns.

SEE EVERY COUNTRY TWICE<br \/>\n<\/strong>a. <strong>Gunnar Garfors. <\/strong>A 44-year-old Norwegian, he was the first person to visit every country in the world twice. \u201cI\u2019ve been to every country, but I have not been to every place and there are always new villages, new mountains, new activities, new or old things to see for the first time or again,\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Garfors has written several travel books published in multiple languages, including \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.brokensleepbooks.com\/product-page\/gunnar-garfors-elsewhere\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Elsewhere<\/a>,\u201d which recounts his experiences in the world\u2019s least visited countries. He also currently has 11 travel-related world records. \u201cWe set the world record of visiting 22 U.S. states in 24 hours and 19 countries in 24 hours. Garfors acknowledges the perceived insanity of this type of extreme travel. \u201cYou go all in on what is essentially a hobby; it\u2019s certainly unusual,\u201d he says. \u201cThen again, if people call me weird or crazy it always beats being called normal. That would be the worst to be told.\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">One of his travel tips described as incredible is he always travels with a small paper notepad to help bypass language barriers. \u201cI was in Iran once and nobody spoke English so we couldn\u2019t order in a restaurant so I drew a sheep and a cow and that\u2019s what we got.\u201d Iran, Sudan, and Ireland are the countries Garfors found to have the warmest locals.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Travel has given him an education in the world but also himself. \u201cSeeing yourself from the outside really opened my eyes. In Kiribati, for instance, [I met people who] haven\u2019t even heard about Norway or Europe and it does kind of hit you in the face that you\u2019re not the center of the universe,\u201d he explains. \u201cIf travel doesn\u2019t humble you, I don\u2019t think anything will.\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Garfors finds it perplexing that some people within the country-counting community aren\u2019t entirely honest about their travel conquests. \u201cQuite a few people are lying or are unable to prove that they\u2019ve been places,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of them they go to airports and they say \u2018oh, I\u2019ve been to a country\u2019 or they go the demilitarized zone between South Korea and North Korea where you don\u2019t get to see anything or talk to anybody.\u201d Garfors prefers to mingle with competitive travellers in forums, Facebook groups, and at extreme travel conferences. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to be able to play ball with someone else as crazy as you are,\u201d he says. Research for Garfors\u2019 latest book about the 13 countries on the equator took him back to the Maldives.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>\u2022<\/strong> In the second week of May 2024, I met two people who had both met Gunnar, claiming to be friends. As soon as I mentioned travel, they immediately said they knew this famous traveller, Gunnar Garfors. One was a teacher I met in the Truro Hospital (in SE England) where I waited for 4 hours in the Emergency to see a Dr. The second was a young Polish woman at Starbucks at the Abu Dhabi Airport. I showed them Gunnars Nomad Mania profile and his map as of May 2024. <strong><br \/>\nMaster Ranking <\/strong>#352<strong> NM <\/strong>536\/1301,<strong>\u00a0DARE<\/strong> 4\/1331,<strong>\u00a0UN <\/strong>193<strong>\u00a0UN+ <\/strong>217\/265<strong>\u00a0TCC <\/strong>233\/330<strong>\u00a0WHS <\/strong>0<strong>, TBT <\/strong>not ranked.

I couldn&#8217;t find any series ranking for Gunnar.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There is no doubt that Gunnar has travelled a lot and must get a lot of self-satisfaction from his accomplishments. He has written 7 books and appears to be very good at self-promotion, I beat him in almost every category but nobody knows anything about me. I rarely post trips on Facebook and am very poor at self-promotion.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">b. <strong>Slawek Muturi. <\/strong>From Warsaw, Poland, he has also been to every country twice. He is half-Polish, half-Kenyan, 57, and works in residential real estate. He speaks 11 foreign languages. Likewise, his NM statistics (June 2024) are OK and certainly better than Gunnar&#8217;s. \u2013 116 on the NM Master list and #4 in Poland, NM1301 \u2013 720, DARE \u2013 1, UN territories \u2013 242, TCC \u2013 267, MTP \u2013 709, WHS none recorded.

He travels about half the year. In his second go, he offers tours with his travel agency, <a href=\"https:\/\/wanderexp.com\/\">Wander Expeditions. <\/a>Doing that, he has had 165 expeditions in 85+ countries with 700 clients from more than 100 nationalities. Most trips are to off-the-beaten-path destinations. \u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Afghanistan is the place where he feels most alive, and where he has been seven times for 100 days. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">He now returns to countries he enjoyed, especially in West Africa and the Middle East. A second visit allows him to see them through a new lens, and often to change his perspective. The most challenging stretch of this goal is between 130 and 159 countries. At that point, you\u2019ve seen so much, but you\u2019re still a long way from the finish line. Pushing through those last regions, often solo, in places that weren\u2019t particularly exciting anymore \u2014 that was the real sacrifice. Now he\u2019d usually rather stay home, work, and stick to his routine than venture into remote places to tick a box. Sudan and North Korea were the most difficult. He visited North Korea in 2025 to participate in the Pyongyang Marathon.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The second time was easier &#8211; visiting every country is mostly a logistical challenge and comes down to time and money. Now, the financial cost of travel is covered by his business. Generally, his impressions tend to improve the second time. He also has a better budget, better accommodations, and curated activities.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">He visited Timbuktu after 40 hours lying in a fishing boat, trying to stay hidden from all the dangers along the shores of the Niger River. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">He thinks he will try for a third round.
