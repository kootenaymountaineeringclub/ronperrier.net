This caused a serial failure of dykes throughout the region and much of the area was flooded. The original idea was to block up the estuaries and create one vast freshwater network, but by the 1960s, this became environmentally unacceptable and the Oosterschalde was left open to the sea tides. The movable barriers can be lowered ahead of possible storm surges.<br \/>\nThe project also raised and strengthened the region\u2019s dykes and added a movable barrier at the Rotterdam harbour. Large areas were dammed and made into freshwater lakes, most noticeable at Veerse Meer. At Blesbosch National Park, the reduction of tides is killing reeds.

Other highlights are a wood barrel-vaulted ceiling, an 18th-century brass choir screen, a 1975 organ (the largest in the Netherlands), and 1968 bronze entry doors with a peace and war theme.<br \/>\n<em>The next three buildings are in the Nomad Mania \u201cModern Architecture\u201d series and all close together near the above church in the Waterstad District:<br \/>\n<\/em><strong>Market Hall.<\/strong> This 10-story market has two floors of stores and eight apartments, each with a balcony.

There are two rows of 12 cubes built over a road. I would have loved to see how the inside worked.<br \/>\n<strong>Witte Huis<\/strong>. When built in the 1850s, this was the first \u2018skyscraper\u2019 in Europe and also the first in the world with an elevator. The 11-story, 43m high building was designed by Willem Molenbrock in art nouveau style using load-bearing brick walls instead of a steel skeleton. It is one of the few buildings in Rotterdam to survive the WWII bombing. The first two floors are stone and the rest are tiled in white brick with turrets on each corner and a Westermeyer sign on top. Unusually there was no information on the outside of the building and I learned some of the above from a few locals in the area.<br \/>\n<strong>KINO.<\/strong> Just north of the museum district is this 4-screen movie theatre with a large, very active bar\/coffee shop busy at 11 am.<br \/>\nThe next 6 museums are in Museum Park on the north side of the river.<br \/>\n<strong>Museum Boijmans van Beuningen.<\/strong> One of Europe\u2019s finest museums, it has a permanent collection spanning all eras of Dutch and European art, including superb old masters. One of the strengths is the many Monet&#8217;s and other French Impressionists plus Van Gogh and Gauguin and statues by Degas. I enjoyed more Magritte&#8217;s, Kandinsky, and several pieces by Salvador Dali, my favourite artist.<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/roosebjorn\/32742055710\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwj70ffK6LDcAhW0wAIHHQRMAZ8QjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/3\/2882\/32742055710_efc03f775a_b.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for dali at museum boijmans van beuningen in rotterdam the netherlands\" width=\"671\" height=\"383\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/500321839839235827\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwjO07ed6LDcAhUEr6QKHYBpBLwQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/e0\/ba\/b7\/e0bab7ebb410fee821e8ca35dd596971.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for museum boijmans van beuningen in rotterdam the netherlands\" width=\"580\" height=\"386\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Het Nieuwe Instituut<\/strong>. With one side surrounded by a green moat and new garden, and the other a flow of brick, it is a merger of the Netherlands Architecture Institute, the Netherlands Institute for Design and Fashion, and the e-culture institute Virtueel Platform, it presents exhibitions on architecture, design, digital culture, and fashion. The exhibit climbing the ramp and continuing on the second floor was all about antennae \u2013 first on insects (each stuck on a pin with the antennae magnified on the board behind) and man-made antennae from those in phones to the new mammoth radio receiving dish being built in China. A Frank Lloyd Wright design using a large antenna was also shown.<br \/>\n<strong>Chabot Museum.<\/strong> In a lovely 1938, white, 3-story villa of Dutch Modern style, there were two artists on display: the permanent exhibition on Henk Chabot (1894-1949) whose lovely lino-cuts were quite nice and a temporary one with George Stahl (1918-82) with unpleasant abstracts, but some very nice geometric abstracts from 1927.<br \/>\n<strong>Museum of Natural History.<\/strong> I don\u2019t enjoy many natural history museums with their cases of stuffed critters, but the exhibits on the ground floor showing man\u2019s interactions with animals had lots of interesting displays.<br \/>\n<strong>Kunsthal<\/strong>. In the basement was a display of fashion more as art than practical clothing, on the ground floor were artists in residence actively working on their pieces, and on the top floor a photographer with many photos on his trips to China. The guy had awful taste in his subjects \u2013 I wonder who thinks he is good? This was not of much interest to me.<br \/>\n<strong>Huis Sonneveld<\/strong>. An outstanding example of Dutch New Building architectural strain, this 1933 villa has been well restored with furniture, wallpaper and fixtures present and correct. This was recommended but I did not go here.<br \/>\n<strong>Witte de With, Centre for Contemporary Art<\/strong>. Actually, down the street from Museum Park, there was actually some work here I enjoyed. These contemporary art museums all have gorgeous, huge galleries with truly awful stuff in them.<br \/>\n<strong>Wereldmuseum.<\/strong> On the water in the original Royal Yacht Club building, it held elite balls and housed collections donated from Rotterdam citizens who collected from around the world. The majority of the museum was closed for renovation (model ships, batiks, Africa, Persia and New Guinea collections are the highlights), but there was a small room with selected iconic objects.

The front 23-floor black tower houses the AKD company, the back 41-story tower on the NE is occupied by Deloitte (the colour fades from black to silver), and the 6-story southeast tower. The heating and cooling system uses water from the Maas and energy storage in the soil to reduce its carbon footprint.<br \/>\n<strong>Nederlands Fotomuseum<\/strong>. With a 5,500,000 collection, only three rotating exhibits are regularly shown. Big Heads by Martin Scholler was heads-only portraits of many famous people, twins, female bodybuilders (from the waist up), transgender people, Formula I drivers, and several wonderful staged photos involving famous people. It was tremendous photography. The exhibit in the basement by Werner Mentz was of inferior quality. Some guys just don\u2019t have a good eye.<br \/>\n<strong>Hotel New York<\/strong>. Originally the 1901 offices of the Holland America Line until 1978, this gorgeous four-story building on the water was converted to a hotel in 1993 with 72 rooms including 2-story rooms in the two towers. A huge, very popular 400-seat restaurant is on the ground floor and another is in the basement.

It was locked and very quiet on a Sunday afternoon.<\/p>\n<p><strong>KINDERKIJK<br \/>\n<\/strong>A World Heritage Site, this area east of Rotterdam has 19 windmills dating from the 18<sup>th<\/sup> century strung out on both sides of canals. The place has been a focus of Dutch efforts to claim land from the water for centuries. The name Kinderkijk is derived from the horrible St Elizabeth\u2019s Day Flood of 1421. It is quite pretty with windmills rising above the empty marshes and waterways like sentinels. Several of the most important types of windmills are here, including hollow postmills and rotating cap mills. They are kept in working condition.<br \/>\nThe entrance ticket has tours of two windmills. Boezemol is a 1738 mill with a 1950s d\u00e9cor that can be climbed for 3 floors showing intimately how the family lived. The third floor was a storeroom and smokehouse using smoke from the kitchen stove. The second Blokwer mill from 1540 has a good video explaining all about the evolution of removing water from the land. They went through many stages of trying to produce land that could be cultivated: initially, dams and dykes and then diversion canals getting water into the river with the windmills used for pumping water. The poder was -2m, the lower canal -1m, the upper canal was .5m, and the river was .3m above sea level. It is a delicate balance removing water lowered the level of the land and more pumping was needed. When steam-powered pumps were developed in 1868, there was little need for windmills.<br \/>\nAt the entrance road is a 1972 diesel-powered pumping station that uses 3 Archimedes screws to move 1,500 cubic metres of water per minute. It replaced 8 windmills.<\/p>\n<p><em>I slept at a McDonald&#8217;s in Dordrecht and then had a busy drive day trying to see the rest of southeast and central Holland before I got my van repaired back in Amsterdam. It was a Monday (16<sup>th<\/sup>) so almost all museums were closed and I drove through each town often stopping around the main squares.<br \/>\n<\/em><em>My trip has developed a sense of haste as I need to be at the north tip of Denmark on July 24<sup>th<\/sup> to get the ferry to Iceland.

It claims to be the oldest Dutch city having been granted a town charter in 1220. It was one of the most powerful Dutch regions until the mid to late 16<sup>th<\/sup> century. In 1572, town leaders from all over the country met here to declare independence from Spain.
