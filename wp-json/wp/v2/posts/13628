The name of nearby\u00a0Mount St. Leon\u00a0is derived from that of the springs and settlement.<br \/>\n<span id=\"History\" class=\"mw-headline\"><strong>History<\/strong>.\u00a0<\/span>The springs were first discovered and land in the area claimed by Michael M. Grady of Revelstoke in 1894 who built a small hotel, then rebuilt it in 1901 and again in 1906\u00a0(Grady Lake and Mount Grady in the same area are named for M.M. Grady).\u00a0The resort was popular throughout the Kootenays and thrived from being a port-of-call on the\u00a0Arrow Lakes steamboat\u00a0route, which connected with railway lines at\u00a0Castlegar\u00a0and\u00a0Revelstoke.<br \/>\nDue to the economic downturn in the first year of\u00a0World War I, Grady closed the hotel and disconnected its supply of hot water from the springs. Citizens of Revelstoke appealed to him to create a townsite out of his original alienation of 320 acres (1.3\u00a0km<sup>2<\/sup>) so they could build campsites and cottages for their own private use, which he did in 1918, with 10 cottages being erected soon after.<br \/>\nThe settlement was inundated, and its name rescinded, following the raising of the level of the Arrow Lakes by the\u00a0Keenlyside Dam\u00a0at Castlegar.<br \/>\n<strong>Closure.<\/strong>\u00a0The private dirt road leading from the highway to the springs has been chained off and is now inaccessible as of the summer of 2016. A man died in the springs due to a heart attack, and the property owners became concerned about lawsuits. A rise in partiers and garbage left behind likely has also contributed to the closure.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>St. Leon, formerly known as\u00a0Leon\u00a0and also known as\u00a0St. Leon Hot Springs\u00a0because of an active mineral spring located nearby, is an unincorporated settlement and former\u00a0hot springs\u00a0resort and steamboat landing on the east side of\u00a0Upper Arrow Lake\u00a0located at the mouth of St. &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2020\/08\/29\/st-leon-hot-springs\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-13628","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-uncategorized"],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p2Ncip-3xO","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/13628","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=13628"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/13628\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":13663,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/13628\/revisions\/13663"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=13628"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=13628"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=13628"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
