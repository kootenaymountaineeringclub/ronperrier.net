This experiment was initiated by the British Government, after the abolition of slavery in the British Empire in 1834, to demonstrate the superiority of \u2018free\u2019 over slave labour in its plantation colonies. The success of the &#8216;Great Experiment&#8217; in Mauritius led to its adoption by other colonial powers from the 1840s, resulting in a world-wide migration of more than two million indentured labourers, of which Mauritius received almost half a million.<br \/>\nBetween 1834 and 1920, almost half a million indentured labourers arrived from India at Aapravasi Ghat to work in the sugar plantations of Mauritius, or to be transferred to Reunion Island, Australia, southern and eastern Africa or the Caribbean. The buildings of Aapravasi Ghat are among the earliest explicit manifestations of what was to become a global economic system and one of the greatest migrations in history.<br \/>\nIt represents not only the development of the modern system of contractual labour, but also the memories, traditions and values that these men, women and children carried with them when they left their countries of origin to work in foreign lands and subsequently bequeathed to their millions of descendants for whom the site holds great symbolic meaning.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>Le Morne Cultural Landscape.<\/strong>\u00a0World Heritage Site. A rugged mountain that juts into the Indian Ocean in the southwest of Mauritius was used as a shelter by runaway slaves, maroons, through the 18th and early years of the 19th centuries. Protected by the mountain\u2019s isolated, wooded and almost inaccessible cliffs, the escaped slaves formed small settlements in the caves and on the summit of Le Morne. The oral traditions associated with the maroons, have made Le Morne a symbol of the slaves\u2019 fight for freedom, their suffering, and their sacrifice, all of which have relevance to the countries from which the slaves came &#8211; the African mainland, Madagascar, India, and South-east Asia. Indeed, Mauritius, an important stopover in the eastern slave trade, also came to be known as the \u201cMaroon republic\u201d because of the large number of escaped slaves who lived on Le Morne Mountain.<\/p>\n<div class=\"box\">\n<div class=\"icaption bordered\"><a href=\"https:\/\/whc.unesco.org\/en\/list\/1259\/gallery\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" title=\"Le Morne Cultural Landscape\" src=\"https:\/\/whc.unesco.org\/uploads\/thumbs\/site_1259_0002-750-0-20131017191237.jpg\" data-src=\"\/uploads\/thumbs\/site_1259_0002-750-0-20131017191237.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"box\">\n<p>Le Morne Cultural Landscape is an exceptional testimony to maroonage or resistance to slavery with the mountain being used as a fortress to shelter escaped slaves.

It is a symbol of slaves\u2019 fight for freedom, their suffering, and their sacrifice, all of which have relevance beyond its geographical location, and represented by the Creole people of Mauritius and their shared memories and oral traditions.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>Black River Georges National Park.<\/strong> Tentative WHS (17\/05\/2006).\u00a0In the hilly south-western part of\u00a0Mauritius in\u00a0an area of 67.54\u00a0km\u00b2 including humid upland\u00a0forest, drier lowland forest and marshy\u00a0heathland. 60 kilometres of trails.<br \/>\nThe park protects most of the island&#8217;s remaining\u00a0rainforest\u00a0although much of this has been degraded by\u00a0introduced\u00a0plants such as\u00a0Chinese guava\u00a0and\u00a0privet\u00a0and animals such as\u00a0rusa deer\u00a0and\u00a0wild pigs.

You can choose between half-day and full-day fishing trips. Big game fishing is best on the west coast of Mauritius because the currents swirl around the foot of Le Morne, creating a marine environment attractive to baitfish, which in turn attracts the larger fish.
