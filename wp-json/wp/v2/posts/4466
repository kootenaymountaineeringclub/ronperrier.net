Cinnabon Rolls<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. CHEESE BISCUITS<\/strong><br \/>\n<em>Dough:<\/em> To 11 oz cold water, add 1 1\/4 lbs Bisquik and 3 oz. freshly shredded cheddar cheese, blending in a mixing bowl until dough is firm. Using a small scoop, place the dough on a baking pan lined witH baking paper. Bake in 375 degree oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown.<br \/>\nBrush baked biscuits with the garlic topping: Mix 1\/2 cup melted butter, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1\/4 tsp salt, 1\/8 tsp onion powder, 1\/8 tsp dried parsley.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. SWEET CORN CAKE<\/strong><br \/>\n1\/2 cup (1 stick butter), softened<br \/>\n1\/3 cup masa harina (mexican corn flour, usually in Latin American groceries or next to flour.<br \/>\n1 1\/2 cups frozen corn, thawed<br \/>\n1\/4 cup cornmeal<br \/>\n1\/3 cup sugar<br \/>\n2 tablespoons heavy cream<br \/>\n1\/4 teaspoon salt<br \/>\n1\/2 teaspoons baking powder<br \/>\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees.<br \/>\nBlend butter in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Add the masa  harina and water to the butter and beat until well combined.<br \/>\nPut defrosted corn into a blender or food processor and with short pulses, coarsely chop the corn on low speed. You want to leave several whole pieces of corn. Stir the chopped corn into the butter and masa harina mixture. Add cornmeal to mixture and combine.<br \/>\nIn another medium bowl, mix together the sugar, cream, salt, and<br \/>\nbaking powder. When the ingredients are well blended, pour the mixture<br \/>\ninto the other bowl and stir everything together BY HAND.<br \/>\nPour corn batter into an ungreased 8&#8243;x8&#8243; baking pan. Cover the pan with aluminum foil. Place this pan into a 13&#8243;x9&#8243; pan filled 1\/3 of the way up with hot water. Bake for 50-60 minutes or until the corn cake is cooked through. When the corn cake is done, remove the small pan from the larger pan and let sit for at least 10 minutes.<br \/>\nTo serve, scoop out each portion with an ice cream scoop or rounded spoon.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. BUTTERMILK BISCUITS<\/strong><br \/>\n4 cups self-rising flour<br \/>\n1 tbsp. sugar<br \/>\n1 tbsp. baking powder<br \/>\n2 cups buttermilk<br \/>\n2\/3 c. shortening<br \/>\nMix together, but do not knead. Roll out to 1&#8243; thick. Cut and brush tops with additional buttermilk. Place on greased cookie sheet. Bake at 400 degrees for 15 minutes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. CHEESE TOAST<\/strong><br \/>\nIn a mixer, cream together 1 lb. Butter (slightly softened), 8 oz. grated Parmesan cheese<br \/>\nPreheat a griddle or large frying pan on medium-high. Spread cheese mixture on sliced Italian bread about 1\/4&#8243; thick. Place bread cheese side down on griddle. Cook until cheese melted. <\/p>\n<p><strong>5. GARLIC CHEESE BREAD<\/strong><br \/>\n1 loaf french bread<br \/>\n1\/2 cup butter<br \/>\n1 cup shredded jack cheese<br \/>\n1 cup shredded asiago cheese<br \/>\n1 cup mayonnaise<br \/>\n1 bunch green onions, chopped<br \/>\n2 cloves  garlic, pureed<br \/>\nSplit french bread loaf into halves horizontally. Mix butter, cheeses, mayonnaise, green onions and garlic in a bowl, blending well. Spread the cut side of bread with spread. Bake at 350 degrees for 7 minutes, then place under broiler about 3 minutes longer. Cut into slices and serve.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6. CHEESE NIPS<\/strong><br \/>\nMakes approximately 300 crackers.<br \/>\n1 cup sifted all-purpose flour (plus 1\/2 cup divided &#038; reserved for kneading and rolling)<br \/>\n1 tsp. baking soda<br \/>\n1\/4 tsp. baking powder<br \/>\n1\/2 cup Kraft Macaroni &#038; Cheese Topping powder (or 2 packages dry cheese powder from 2 boxes Kraft macaroni &#038; cheese)<br \/>\n3 tssp. shortening<br \/>\n1\/3 cup buttermilk<br \/>\n1\/2 tsp. salt (for tops, optional)<br \/>\nSift together 1 cup flour, baking soda, baking powder and cheese powder in a large bowl. Cut in the shortening with a fork and knife with a crosswise motion until dough is broken down into rice-size pieces. Mixture will still be very dry.<br \/>\nStir in buttermilk with a fork until dough becomes very moist and sticky.<br \/>\nSprinkle a couple tablespoons of the reserved flour over the dough and work it in until it can be handled without sticking, then turn it out onto a floured board, being sure to keep 1\/4 cup of the reserve flour for later. Knead the dough well for 60 to 90 seconds, and the flour is incorporated. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill for at least one hour.<br \/>\nPreheat oven to 325 degrees. Spray a light coating of cooking spray on a baking sheet.<br \/>\nRemove the dough from the refrigerator and use the remaining reserve flour to dust a rolling surface. Roll about one-third of the dough to just under 1\/16th of inch thick. Trim the edges square (a pizza cutter or wheel works great for this), then transfer the dough to a lightly greased baking sheet. Use the rolling pin to transfer the dough. Simply pick up one end of the dough onto a rolling pin, and roll the dough around the rolling pin. Reverse the process onto the baking sheet to transfer the dough.<br \/>\nUse a pizza cutter to cut across and down the dough, creating 1-inch square pieces. Use the blunt end of a skewer or broken toothpick to poke a hole in the center of each piece.<br \/>\nSprinkle a very light coating of salt over the top of the crackers (crackers will already be quite salty) and bake for 8-10 minutes, mix the crackers around (so those on the edge don\u2019t burn) and bake for another 3-5 minutes, or until some are just barely turning a light brown. Repeat the rolling and baking process with the remaining dough.<\/p>\n<p><strong>7. HONEY WHEAT BUSHMAN BREAD<\/strong>   Makes 8 small loaves.<br \/>\nDough: 1 1\/2 cups warm water, 2 tablespoons butter, softened, 1\/2 cup honey, 2 cups bread flour, 1 2\/3 cups wheat flour, 1 tablespoon cocoa, 1 tablespoon granulated sugar, 2 teaspoons instant coffee, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 1\/4 teaspoons (1 pkg.) yeast<br \/>\nColoring: 1\/4 cup water, 75 drops red food coloring, 45 drops blue food coloring, 30 drops yellow food coloring, Cornmeal for dusting<br \/>\n1. If using a bread machine, add all of the ingredients for the dough<br \/>\n   in the exact order listed into the pan of your machine. Set it on<br \/>\n   &#8220;knead&#8221; and when the machine begins to mix the dough, combine the<br \/>\n   food coloring withd 1\/4 cup of water and drizzle it into the mixture as<br \/>\n   it combines. After the dough is created let it rest to rise for an<br \/>\n   hour or so. Then remove it from the pan and go to step #3.<br \/>\n2. If you are not using a bread machine, combine the flours, cocoa, sugar,<br \/>\n   coffee and salt in large bowl. Make a depression or &#8220;well&#8221; in the<br \/>\n   middle of the dry mixture. Pour the warm water into this &#8220;well,&#8221;<br \/>\n   then add the butter, honey and yeast. Combine the food coloring<br \/>\n   drops with 1\/4 cup of water and add that to the &#8220;well.&#8221; Slowly mix<br \/>\n   the ingredients with a spoon, drawing the dry ingredients into<br \/>\n   the wet. When you can handle the dough, begin to combine it by hand,<br \/>\n   kneading the dough thoroughly for at least ten minutes, until it is<br \/>\n   very smooth and has a consistent color. Set the dough into a covered<br \/>\n   bowl in a warm place for an hour, to allow it to rise.<br \/>\n3. When the dough has risen to about double in size, punch it down and<br \/>\n   divide it into 8 even portions (divide dough in half, divide those<br \/>\n   halves in half, and then once more). Form the portions into tubular<br \/>\n   shaped loaves about 8 inches long and 2 inches wide. Sprinkle the<br \/>\n   entire surface of the loaves with cornmeal and place them on a cookie<br \/>\n   sheet, or two. Cover the cookie sheet(s) with plastic wrap and let<br \/>\n   the dough rise once more for another hour in a warm location.<br \/>\n4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Uncover the dough and bake it for<br \/>\n   20-24 minutes in the hot oven. Loaves should begin to darken slightly<br \/>\n   on top when done. Serve warm with a sharp bread knife and butter<br \/>\n   on the side. If you want whipped butter, like you get at the<br \/>\n   restaurant, just use an electric mixer on high speed to whip<br \/>\n   some butter until it&#8217;s fluffy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>8. CINNABON ROLLS<\/strong> Makes about 20 very large rolls.<br \/>\nRolls: 1\/2 cup warm water, 2 packages dry yeast, 2 tbsp. sugar, 3 1\/2 oz. pkg. vanilla pudding mix, 1\/2 cup margarine melted, 2 eggs. 1 tsp salt, 6 cups flour<br \/>\n<em>Cream Cheese Frosting:<\/em> 1\/2 cup margarine, 1 tsp. vanilla, 3 cups confectioner&#8217;s sugar, 1 tbsp. milk. Mix all ingredients until smooth.<br \/>\nIn a bowl combine water, yeast and sugar. Stir until dissolved. Set aside.<br \/>\nIn large bowl, take pudding mix and prepare according to package directions. Add margarine, eggs and salt. Mix well. Then add yeast mixture. Blend.<br \/>\nGradually add flour; knead until smooth. Place in a greased bowl. Cover and let rise until doubled. Punch down dough and let rise again.<br \/>\nThen roll out on floured board to 34 x 21&#8243; size. Take 1 cup soft butter and spread over surface.<br \/>\nIn bowl, mix 2 cups brown sugar and 4 tsp cinnamon. Sprinkle over top. Roll up very tightly. With knife, put a notch every 2&#8243;. Cut with thread or knife. Place on lightly greased cookie sheet 2&#8243; apart. Take hand and lightly press down on each roll. Cover and let rise until double again.<br \/>\nBake at 350 15-20 minutes. Remove when they start to turn golden.
