The first pitch features a shallow chimney feature with waterfall ice. 8 or 9 pitches. <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">(D+, WI4, M5, 350m)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>FA David Lussier, Jennifer Olsen, 6\/11\/2019<\/em><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br \/>\nP1. 50m, WI 4, M1. Climb a shallow chimney feature with good ice, stemming on the left rock wall occasionally, for about 35m (WI 4) to a sloping ledge system with mixed snow and rock. Traverse right along this ledge for 20m to a piton belay just left of the thin ice sheet forming pitch 2. The length of this pitch depends on snow levels and glacial recession.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">P2. 50m, WI 3+r, M3. Step right a few metres and climb up a thin ice smear overlying a 75 \u00b0 rock slab (WI 3+, runout, stubbies useful) for about 25m to another sloping ledge system. Traverse left across the sloping ledge about 15m on mixed snow\/rock, then climb up and right via a dry groove (M3) for about 15m to the base of a more defined gully system. Belay on good gear in a thin crack on the right side.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">P3. 30m, M3. Climb up mixed snow and rock (M3) in the gully\/chimney system, passing a piton anchor on the left.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">P4. 60m, M3. Continue up the gully system via dry mixed ground passing a few minor rock steps (M3) for about 30m, at which point a hanging snowfield (40-45 \u00b0) is gained. Climb up past this snowfield and belay on gear near the bottom left of the upper gully\/chimney system.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">P5. 30m, M1. An easier snow-filled gully pitch leads towards a great-looking ice vein in steepening terrain above.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">P6. 30m, WI3, M3. Climb the super fun ice vein in gully\/corner above (WI 3) to a sling belay below a steep rock wall where the gully veers left.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">P7. 40m, M5. Follow mixed snow &amp; rock up the left trending gully to where it veers right below an imposing chockstone. Climb a steep right-facing corner on the right side of the chockstone via good crack and gear (M5) to easier mixed terrain above. Belay on lower-angle terrain at the base of the upper snow couloir.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">P8-9. 100m, 45-55 \u00b0. Climb the steepening snow couloir to the top and the summit plateau. A 5-10-minute walk across the plateau leads to the main summit.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Historical significance: Part of this route was surprisingly used as a rappel route during the summer of 1977 (CAJ 61: 161). A party of 3, taking part in the ACC general mountaineering camp located in Mulvey basin, rappelled down the north couloir after making an ascent of the North Ridge. They left a few piton anchors and slings in place. David and Jen saw some of them on their ascent and used one of their piton belays for rappelling.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The story: New routing in the mountains has been my passion for over 20 years. For me, this passion has grown to be just as exciting as climbing existing routes. The adventure, the puzzle, the unknown and the feeling of accomplishment are among the stimulating factors. It was always important to make sure that my passion did not become an obsession. The latter has the potential to govern your life, which is unhealthy and potentially risky. That said, even at a managed passion level, it is more dangerous to venture into the unknown and climb new routes than it is to follow a known established one. The following is an account of a recent new route established in these principles during the Fall of 2019<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The appeal for this particular climb started in November 1996 when Tom Dool and I went to Mulvey Basin for an adventurous early winter ski touring weekend. It had snowed a fair amount in October up high; however, there was very little snow below the tree line, making it possible to drive a SUV to the regular Gimli trailhead at 1700m. We skied in with all our ski touring and winter camping paraphernalia. It was a beautiful, cold, early winter weekend with clear skies. There was just enough snow in the alpine to gingerly ski on planar lee terrain. We skied in the headwaters of Mulvey basin that weekend and bagged a ski descent of the regular East face route on Asgard Peak.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">That weekend, we saw Mulvey Basin from a very different lens. The beautiful alpine rock walls were just as stunning, but the early-season snow cover on the nearby north-facing walls revealed ample winter mix climbing potential. There are endless options on the many north-facing gully features spanning from Mount Dag on the left to Gimli Peak on the right. The North Face of Gimli was of particular interest. It had some great-looking continuous features, making it very desirable for winter mixed climbing. The center of the upper face was bisected by a deep couloir leading down into a series of interesting mixed corners interspersed by short steep steps in an appealing line spanning down to the little pocket glacier below. We left Mulvey Basin that weekend with the realization that winter alpinism was possible here and, in fact, desirable.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Years passed, and I visited Mulvey Basin during the summer months for alpine rock-climbing countless times. Every time I got a chance to glimpse at the Gimli North face, it would bring me back to that moment, that realization. Some mountain features have a way to lure the opportunistic adventure climbers more than others, and this feature did just that. Every other Fall since then, I would scheme a plan with friends to try. It was difficult for all the elements to align, partners, avalanche conditions, weather, time off, etc. There was also the unknown factor, you couldn\u2019t just drive up the road and inspect it from the comfort of your vehicle; you had to go right up to the base to know the conditions. Most new routes have a high degree of uncertainty; this one was no exception. Its location and associated snow climate made it more challenging to evaluate from afar.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">It was the Fall of 2019 when everything finally lined up for a serious attempt. It required two attempts over one week to complete the route. We had seen a couple of good early-season snow dumps up high; however, it had been 10 days since the last storm and temperatures in the alpine were below freezing throughout. We had the perfect mix of early-season weather conditions and a strong potential partner lineup for a solid attempt. The first attempt was made on Halloween as a day trip from Nelson with fellow ACMG guide and friend Stephen Senecal. The lure of doing it light and fast as a day trip, without knowing the conditions, worked against us on this attempt. Snow conditions were very similar to the ones we encountered back in 1996. Getting to the trailhead with good snow tires and an SUV was easy. Of note, a Winter attempt would require skinning up an additional 13km along the road while gaining 1000m elevation (or snowmobiling in) to access the parking lot. There was only 30cm of snow at the trailhead, but snow increased with elevation quickly to about 100cm at treeline. From the trailhead, we skinned up 5km along the summer trail with 850m elevation gain to the Gimli col. There was just enough snow to skin up on the trail and not enough coverage to venture off-trail below treeline. We left all the touring gear at the col and continued on foot from there.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">From the col, we did a 30m rappel over a rock band down the North side onto the snow slope below. We dug a satisfactory snowpack test before pulling our ropes and then starting to walk diagonally, losing about 100m in elevation, across the steep snow slope in a North-easterly direction to gain the small pocket glacier below the North face. We got to the base of the route later than anticipated, but were quite pleased with what we could see. The first pitch looked good; a beautiful 30m waterfall ice 4 (WI4) feature tucked in the back of an open chimney feature right off the glacier. We proceeded to climb this on good protectable ice, stemming occasionally on the nearby rock wall to the left. Following this, a 20m right-hand traverse across a 50-degree mixed ledge system led to a piton belay at the base of a thin-looking ice flow overlying 75-degree rock slabs. I started tackling the thin ice of pitch 2. It was already after noon by then, and we knew we had a lot of unknown terrain beyond. Also, the ice was thin, the gear was sparse, and daylight hours were limited. After trying a few different options in mounting uncertainty, I decided to bail and downclimb back to the belay. Stephen and I rapped off and slowly made our way back to the trailhead and eventually home in Nelson. I couldn\u2019t help but think that with a bit more time and a few more stubbies (very short ice screws), I would have committed to the pitch. Self-critique was building on the walkout, but I was already scheming a return. We had learned so much about the route on our attempt, so we had to come back with a better strategy.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The second attempt and successful ascent was done with my friend and fellow guide, Jen Olsen, about a week later. Stephen had headed to the Rockies and was unable to join for the second attempt. The weather had generally been favourable between the two attempts. Jen and I decided to try it over two days and bivouac near the route before our attempt. This proved to be quite crucial in our success. We headed out the day before with all the gear, drove to the parking lot, skied in and camped near the regular summer campsite for the south ridge of Gimli. The next morning, we got up at 4 am, made a quick breakfast and headed off towards the climb. The approach was just as slow going as the previous attempt, but we had fresh legs and some knowledge of what to expect, and confidence was high. We got to the base around 6:30 am, and I offered the first pitch to Jen, which she enjoyed. We were back near the previous high point in no time, and it was my lead. It felt terrific to be back there without time pressure and more stubble to tackle the pitch. I immersed myself in the task at hand and confidently climbed through the thin ice smear overlying a 75-degree rock slab for 25m, finding small gear occasionally, to the next sloping ledge system. Yahoo! What a relief it was to have climbed that section with confidence. A short traverse left led to the beginning of the main weakness, which appeared to continue up the North Face to the summit plateau.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">From there onwards, Jen and I swung leads while following the main gully feature. We enjoyed an interesting mix of climbing, primarily involving snow up to 55 degrees and multiple rock steps in the M3 range. Snow and avalanche conditions were favourable, and the gully feature was becoming progressively more defined with elevation. We encountered a very nice ice pitch on pitch 6; a fine 30m WI 3 goulotte (ice vein in the back of a corner feature). This is where Jen dropped her iPhone with all the good photos she had taken thus far. Getting past the right-hand side of a steep chockstone in the deepening gully on Pitch 7 was the crux rock pitch at M5 (mixed climbing on steep rock level 5). The last two pitches along the final couloir to the summit plateau were mainly steep snow in the 45-55 degree range.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">After reaching the summit plateau on top of the couloir, we celebrated briefly and started our descent. We opted to reverse the process and rappel the route. We managed to do half of the descent in daylight but had to do the rest in the dark, thanks to the short November days! When we went to the base, we looked for Jen\u2019s iPhone but could not find it. We retraced our steps back up and over the Gimli Col and, after switching back to ski gear, skied back to our camp after 16 hours of nonstop travel. We then packed our overnight gear and started skiing out via the summer trail in the dark. At about 2000m, we strapped the skis to our packs and walked out along the summer trail back to the vehicle, tired but very happy. We feasted on celebratory chips, beer and kombucha as we drove down the snowy road back to the safety of our home valley.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">It wasn\u2019t until the following days that the realization started to hit home for me. On top of accomplishing a great climb with good friends, I had completed a long-time project. That was super satisfying, especially since it felt like we had calculated the risk fairly accurately and that the conditions were optimal. The route name \u201cKootenay Canaleta\u201d was Jen\u2019s idea. It reminded her of the \u201cSupercanaleta\u201d route on Fitzroy in Patagonia, but without the international traffic. I thought it was very fitting. She added that Gimli offers a pristine setting, \u2018more beautiful than the sun\u2019, and the North face is a \u2018fire-shelter\u2019. We were lucky with perfect winter temperatures just below freezing\u201d.
