Prime season July to August<br \/>\n<strong>Access:<\/strong> 4WD logging road. Last 3kms rough.<br \/>\n<strong>Map:<\/strong> 82E\/9 Burrell Creek, 82E\/8<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nDrive:<\/strong> From Castlegar, drive to Robson and start west on Broadwater Road that continues along the north and east side of the Columbia River and Lower Arrow Lakes.<br \/>\nJust before the yellow gates in Syringa Creek Provincial Park, turn right onto the &#8220;Deer Park Forest Service Road&#8221;. Follow this narrow, good 2 wheel drive gravel road to the community of Deer Park.<br \/>\n35kms. In Deer Park, turn right. There is a small &#8220;Renata&#8221; sign, pointing the way. Zero odometer. Within a half kilometre, the road forks. Take the upper fork to the right, continuing along this road.<br \/>\n18.7 km the road forks again. Left takes you to the lake shore, and the boat launch to Renata. Go right to continue on to Sunshine Bay. From here the road deteriorates, and a high clearance vehicle is recommended.<br \/>\n25 km. Pass through the old fruit growing community of Broadwater. At the junction in Broadwater, take the right fork onto the Sunshine Creek Forest Service Road.<br \/>\n31kms. Right at the fork just before the 31 km sign, and passing over the Two Bit Creek bridge.<br \/>\n34kms. The last 3 km descend steeply to Sunshine Bay Recreation Site. The last bit of road down to the water is usually the worst part of the drive.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sunshine Bay:<\/strong>\u00a0Sunshine Bay has a long history. Two kukuli across the road from the recreation site attest to occupation by First Nations people long before recorded history. The remains of a log cabin on the site is of more recent vintage.<br \/>\nSunshine Bay offers a crescent shaped, south facing beach and protected campsites under a pine stand.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nWhat to Do:<\/strong>\u00a0Nearby, the mouth of Sunshine Creek has good fishing. The road past Sunshine Bay offers good hiking to Gladstone Creek, another 4kms. Beach combing when the water in the Lower Arrow Lake is down. It is difficult to get a boat down to the water at Sunshine Bay, as the bank drops off abruptly. A flight of stairs goes from the campsite to the beach. A canoe, kayak or inflatable zodiac would be your best bet. The closest good boat launch is at the Renata turn-off, at 18.7 km.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Truly at the end of the road, Sunshine Bay has a west-facing rock beach.
