His classmates remember him as a tall, quiet, \u201cun-English-looking\u201d boy in unfashionable knickerbockers who virtually lived in the library, maintaining a \u201cmonomaniacal focus\u201d on science while seeking refuge from his father\u2019s pedantry in adventure novels and comic books.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">His uncanny aptitude for math showed itself early. A teacher once sent young Dirac home with a set of problems designed to keep him occupied all evening, and was shocked when he had solved them by the afternoon. Even as a boy, he preferred a life of contemplation to the hurly-burly of the schoolyard. When he was nine, his teachers at the Bishop Road School awarded him a telling prize: a copy of Daniel Defoe\u2019s Robinson Crusoe, the fictional autobiography of a castaway marooned for twenty-eight years on a remote island.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Lacking an aristocratic father to introduce him to potential mentors in science, Dirac trained at a technical school to become an electrical engineer. In his first year, he distinguished himself so highly that Cambridge offered him a scholarship to its prestigious math program. At St. John\u2019s College, his diffidence and taciturnity became \u201cthe stuff of legend,\u201d writes Graham Farmelo in a biography of the physicist The Strangest Man. The newly matriculated Dirac would sit stiffly in the dining hall, hesitant to ask the person eating beside him to pass the salt and greeting every question posed to him with blank silence or a stark yes or no. Incapable of bluffing his way through the protocols of polite conduct, he came across as cold, rude, disinterested, or uncaring, though he didn\u2019t intend to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A classmate once tried to break the ice with him by casually remarking, \u201cIt\u2019s a bit rainy, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Dirac\u2019s strictly empirical response was to march over to the window, peer out, return to his chair and reply, \u201cIt is not now raining.\u201d Inspired by his extreme verbal parsimony, his fellow students at St. John\u2019s invented a unit of measurement for the number of words a person might utter in conversation, christening the minimum rate of one \u201cDirac\u201d \u2013 one word per hour. But, like Cavendish lurking in the shadows at the Monday Club, he would often eavesdrop inconspicuously as his peers swapped stories.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Oblivious to contemporary modes of dress, Dirac wore cheap, unstylish suits in all weathers until they were threadbare, even after securing a generous salary as the Lucasian Chair of Mathematics at Cambridge (the position later held by Steven Hawking). His mother practically had to beg him to buy a winter coat so she could stop fretting about his health. Though he seemed impervious to freezing temperatures, he was acutely sensitive to sounds, particularly the barking of dogs permanently banned from his household. Dirac\u2019s motor skills were notoriously poor; a classmate described his method of wielding a cricket bat as \u201cpeculiarly inept.\u201d Yet he was as devoted as Cavendish was to taking long walks on a regimented timetable, holding his hands behind his back as he efficiently ticked off the miles in his \u201cmetronomic\u201d stride.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In an era when physicists like Einstein and Max Planck were feted as international heroes in the press, Dirac had no interest in being a public figure. He routinely turned down honorary degrees because he felt they should be awarded strictly on merit, and he refused a knighthood because he didn\u2019t want strangers chummily referring to him as \u201cSir Paul\u201d rather than \u201cMr. Dirac.\u201d Upon winning the Nobel Prize in physics with Erwin Schrodinger in 1933, he told a reporter from a Swedish newspaper, \u201cMy work has no practical significance.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">His life path diverged from Cavendish in at least one crucial way: he married a bubbly Belgian extrovert named Margit Wigner, nicknamed \u201cManci,\u201d who urged him to supplement his pop-culture diet of comic books and Mickey Mouse cartoons with novels and occasional forays to the ballet. (As Farmelo puts it, \u201cHe had wed his anti-particle.\u201d)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The newlyweds honeymooned in Brighton, where the love-struck groom rigged up a camera with a string to click the shutter himself. In one shot, the gawky physicist reclines beside his bride on the beach, attired in his usual three-piece suit, with a thicket of pencils sprouting from his pocket. \u201cYou have made a wonderful alteration in my life. You have made me human,\u201d Dirac gushed shortly after the wedding. This turned out to be an ongoing job. When Manci complained that he habitually ignored her questions, he pasted her queries into a spreadsheet and filled it in with his replies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As a theoretical physicist, Dirac didn\u2019t need a lab to do his work; he only needed a pencil because his most finely calibrated instrument was his mind\u2019s eye. When he was young, a teacher told him she felt he was cogitating not in words but in \u201canother medium of forms and figures.\u201d He once described his thoughts as essentially \u201cgeometrical.\u201d While visiting an art gallery in Copenhagen, he turned to fellow Nobel laureate Niels Bohr. He liked a particular painting because \u201cthe degree of inaccuracy is the same all over.\u201d He told journalists who asked him to make sketches of his highly abstract concepts for their readers that they would melt away like \u201csnowflakes\u201d if he tried.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The breakthrough that assured him of his eponymous place in history is known as the Dirac equation. Worked out on a scrap of paper at a schoolboy\u2019s desk in his sparsely furnished room at St. John\u2019s in less than a month in 1927, his formula bridged a seemingly impassable gulf in physics by reconciling quantum mechanics and Einstein\u2019s special relativity in a single concise line of variables. His equation also implied the existence of a previously unsuspected form of particle\u2013antimatter, three years before a scientist named Carl Anderson glimpsed the ghostly arcs of positrons passing through a lead plate in his lab.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Dirac made only one miscalculation during his career: understanding the practical applicability of his work. The relationships between matter and energy that he described made possible the development of semiconductors, transistors, integrated circuits, computers, handheld devices, and the other innovations in microelectronics that ushered in the digital age. By capturing the ephemeral snowflakes in his mind in the universal language of mathematics, this man, who found communication so arduous, made it much easier for everyone to communicate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But even in a field where absent-minded professors are the rule rather than the exception, Dirac\u2019s colleagues were left unsettled and confused by his behaviour. Einstein confessed, \u201cI have trouble with Dirac. This balancing on the dizzying path between genius and madness is awful.\u201d Bohr claimed that Dirac was \u201cthe strangest man\u201d he had ever met, finishing Farmelo with a title for his biography. Like Cavendish, he was a walking riddle to everyone who crossed his path.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Addition from Wikipedia:<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span id=\"Family\" class=\"mw-headline\"><em><strong>Family.<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0<\/span>In 1937, Dirac married Margit Wigner (Eugene Wigner\u2019s sister). He adopted Margit\u2019s two children, Judith and\u00a0Gabriel. Paul and Margit Dirac had two children together, both daughters, Mary Elizabeth and Florence Monica.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Margit, known as Manci, visited her brother in 1934 in Princeton, New Jersey, from their native Hungary and, while at dinner at the Annex Restaurant, met the \u201clonely-looking man at the next table\u201d. This account from a Korean physicist, Y. S. Kim, who met and was influenced by Dirac, also says: \u201cIt is quite fortunate for the physics community that Manci took good care of our respected Paul A. M. Dirac. Dirac published eleven papers during the period 1939\u201346\u2026 Dirac could only maintain his normal research productivity because Manci controlled everything else\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span id=\"Personality\" class=\"mw-headline\"><em><strong>Personality.<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0<\/span>Dirac was known among his colleagues for his precise and taciturn nature.

At the same time, Dirac\u2014\u2019 an Edwardian geek\u2019, as biographer Graham Farmelo puts it\u2014suffered agonies if forced into socializing or small talk. \u2018Why do you dance?\u2019 Dirac asked his companion. \u2018When there are nice girls, it is a pleasure,\u2019 Heisenberg replied.

After a long silence, the moderator asked Dirac if he wanted to answer the question, to which Dirac replied: \u201cThat was not a question, it was a comment.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><sup id=\"cite_ref-44\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-45\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>Dirac was also noted for his modesty.

Most physicists speak of Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics for half-integer-spin particles and Bose\u2013Einstein statistics for integer-spin particles. While lecturing later in life, Dirac insisted on calling the former \u201cFermi statistics\u201d. He referred to the latter as \u201cBose statistics\u201d for reasons, he explained, of \u201csymmetry\u201d.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span id=\"Views_on_religion\" class=\"mw-headline\"><strong><em><br \/>\nViews on religion.<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0<\/span>Heisenberg recollected a conversation among young participants at the 1927 Solvay Conference about Einstein and Planck\u2019s views on religion between Wolfgang Pauli, Heisenberg, and Dirac. Dirac\u2019s contribution was a criticism of the political purpose of religion, which Bohr regarded as quite lucid when hearing it from Heisenberg later.<sup id=\"cite_ref-47\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>\u00a0Among other things, Dirac said:\u00a0<em>I cannot understand why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest\u2014and scientists have to be\u2014we must admit that religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality.<br \/>\nThe very idea of God is a product of the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, we do not need such solutions when we understand so many natural processes. I can\u2019t see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as to why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich, and all the other horrors He might have prevented.<br \/>\nIf religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit.<br \/>\nReligion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence, there was a close alliance between the State and the Church, two great political forces. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards\u2014in heaven if not on earth\u2014all who have not risen against injustice and have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins.<br \/>\n<\/em><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Heisenberg\u2019s view was tolerant. Pauli, raised as a Catholic, had kept silent after some initial remarks, but when finally he was asked for his opinion, said: \u201cWell, our friend Dirac has got a religion and its guiding principle is \u2018There is no God, and Paul Dirac is His prophet.\u00a0\u2018\u201d Everybody, including Dirac, burst into laughter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><sup id=\"cite_ref-49\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-50\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>Later in life, Dirac\u2019s views towards the idea of God were less acerbic. As an author of an article appearing in the May 1963 edition of\u00a0<i>Scientific American<\/i>, Dirac wrote:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>It is one of the fundamental features of nature that fundamental physical laws are described in terms of a mathematical theory of incredible beauty and power, needing quite a high standard of mathematics for one to understand it. You may wonder: Why is nature constructed along these lines? One can only answer that our present knowledge shows that nature is so built. We have to accept it. One could perhaps describe the situation by saying that God is a mathematician of a very high order, and He used very advanced mathematics in constructing the universe. Our feeble attempts at mathematics enable us to understand a bit of the universe. We can understand the universe better as we develop higher and higher mathematics.<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p>In 1971, at a conference meeting, Dirac expressed his views on the existence of God.\u00a0<sup id=\"cite_ref-52\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>Dirac explained that the existence of God could be justified only if an improbable event were to have taken place in the past: <span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>It is tough to start life. It might be so challenging to start a life that it has happened only once among all the planets\u2026 Just as a conjecture, let us consider that the chance of life starting when we have suitable physical conditions is 10<sup>\u2212100<\/sup>. I don\u2019t have any logical reason for proposing this figure; please consider it a possibility. Under those conditions \u2026 it is almost sure that life would not have started. And I feel that under those conditions, it will be necessary to assume the existence of a god to start life. I would like, therefore, to set up this connection between the existence of a god and the physical laws. If physical laws are such that starting life involves a minimal chance, so it will not be reasonable to suppose that life would have started just by blind luck, then there must be a god. Such a god would probably be showing his influence in the quantum jumps that take place later on. On the other hand, if life can start very easily and does not need any divine influence, then I will say that there is no god.<br \/>\n<\/em>Dirac did not commit himself to any definite view, but he described the possibilities for scientifically answering the question of God.<sup id=\"cite_ref-54\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Dirac biographer Graham Farmelo came to the same conclusion as Sachs did with Cavendish. \u201cNearly all\u201d of the Dirac stories that physicists have been telling each other for years, he wrote in\u00a0<em>The Strangest Man<\/em>, \u201cmight also be called \u2018autism stories.\u2019\u201d After interviewing 30 people who knew Dirac very well (including two members of his close family), he concluded that his behaviour was so singular that he very clearly passed every criterion for autistic behaviour.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"html-div xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd\">\n<div class=\"html-div xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd\" dir=\"auto\">\n<div class=\"html-div xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd\" data-ad-rendering-role=\"story_message\">\n<div id=\":rgh:\" class=\"x1l90r2v x1pi30zi x1swvt13 x1iorvi4\" data-ad-comet-preview=\"message\" data-ad-preview=\"message\">\n<div class=\"x78zum5 xdt5ytf xz62fqu x16ldp7u\">\n<div class=\"xu06os2 x1ok221b\">\n<div class=\"xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs x126k92a\">\n<div dir=\"auto\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Paul Dirac wasn\u2019t just a brilliant theoretical physicist but a man whose presence sparked fascination and bewilderment.
