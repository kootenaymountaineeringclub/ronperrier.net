Maintaining speeds of 140-160kms\/hour, the speedsters in the left lane were still breezing by me. I needed gas \u2013 the first station would not accept my credit card (that\u2019s a first), I continued, turned off the highway to see the monument and then drove through several villages until I was almost empty until finally I found diesel.

Truly in the middle of nowhere surrounded by fields, this was a huge adventure getting to and leaving \u2013 but worth coming to for the remoteness and colossal size and construction of the monument. If I had not done the detours to get gas, Google Maps said it was 28kms from the turnoff from the expressway. Then on leaving, it was 3\u00bdkms to pass under the expressway (a big gas truck here asked if the road was passable in Romanian, the only vehicle I saw on the entire drive) and then another 5kms on rough, potholed gravel following the canal to pavement in the town of Murfatlar where I crossed the canal to continue to Constanta.<br \/>\nIt sits on a small rise (supported by a retaining wall around the base) on the edge of a canal completely controlled with a cement wall and high terraces. It is accessed on gravel roads each way. The monument is a huge abstract construction of stainless steel\/aluminum? plates set onto a reinforced concrete base &#8211; first a round 1m high, 10m diameter base, then a 2m high triangular piece and then a 4m high triangle that overlaps the first two. This has 56 pieces of rebar sticking out on each of the three sides that I guessed held a frieze but all that is gone. Then there is the metal structure on top.<br \/>\nUnfortunately graffiti covered a lot of the cement and they had even managed to get on top of the third overhanging piece (ladders) to graffiti the steel. The whole place is totally untended with weeds, grass and wild flowers growing out of all the cracks in the cement.

On the banks of the Danube-Black Sea Channel, this monument was built by the Communist Youth League to remember the Romanians who constructed the Danube-Black Sea Canal, but also to symbolize freedom or flight to infinity. Thousands of political prisoners died during 1949-1955 construction of the canal as they were subjected to a extermination regime. The canal was the beginning of the works for the realization of the &#8220;fourth arm of the Danube&#8221;.\u00a0It is a quasi-unknown monument, built near \u200b\u200bthe former village of Straja.<br \/>\nInaugurated in the late 1980s, the monument cost at the time a bridge, according to the artist who conceived it.\u00a0Embodying a highly stylized angel without wings \u2013 an angel of freedom &#8211; the 50-meter high monument is the 35th highest statue of the world, though actually it is below sea level.\u00a0After the Statue of Liberty, it was the highest monument in the world\u00a0when it was raised.<br \/>\nIt is erected on a ten-foot concrete socket with twelve columns fixed to a depth of 20 meters, and is made of stainless steel.\u00a0The statue, without a socket, is 38 meters tall.\u00a0Once, the base was adorned with massive bronze bas-reliefs, depicting episodes from the construction of the Canal.\u00a0After the 1989 Revolution, the Youth Monument went into oblivion.\u00a0In 2000, a band of entrepreneurial thieves armed with artillery removed the three bas-reliefs &#8211; bronze plates ranged from 14 to 19 tons, according to the artist.\u00a0However, the Police report noted that the plates weighed five tons.\u00a0Only some of these were recovered from a collection center in Calarasi County. The thieves also took the stainless steel plates at the base of the monument, as well as the bronze letters on the base that addressed the following message: &#8220;Future generations know that we have sacrificed ourselves for the ascension of the Homeland.&#8221;<br \/>\nThe artist who created the monument, Pavel Bucur,\u00a0\u201cIt&#8217;s a shame that&#8217;s going on. Today, no one cares for this colossus, which, if properly put to good use, could have its contribution in attracting tourists.\u00a0An idea would be to restore and redecorate by placing new bas-reliefs.\u00a0It is not normal for such an imposing monument to be left out!\u00a0Just as the statue of Prometheus stands on the Vidraru Great Dam as well as the Monument of the Youth, &#8220;the angel with a broken wing&#8221;\u00a0stands guard on the open waterway of the monumental human work of the Danube &#8211; Black Sea Canal.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DANUBE-BLACK SEA CANAL<\/strong>\u00a0(Canalul Dun\u0103re \u2013 Marea Neagr\u0103) is a navigable\u00a0canal\u00a0in\u00a0Romania, which runs from\u00a0Cernavod\u0103, on the\u00a0Danube\u00a0river to\u00a0Constan\u021ba\u00a0(1976-1984; 64.4kms, southern arm, the main branch), and to\u00a0N\u0103vodari\u00a0(1983-1987; 31.2kms, northern arm), on the\u00a0Black Sea.

The Canal was notorious as the site of\u00a0labor camps\u00a0in early 1950s\u00a0Communist Romania, when at any given time, up to 20,000\u00a0political prisoners\u00a0worked on its excavation.

These first arrivals were soon joined by newly arrested people who were sent to the canal in ever increasing numbers. By 1950 the forced\u00a0labor camps\u00a0set up along the length of the planned canal were filled to capacity; that year alone, up to 15,000 prisoners were held in those camps.\u00a0By 1953, the number of prisoners had swelled to 20,193, though older estimates claimed figures as high as 60,000. One million Romanians had been imprisoned in various prisons and labor camps, including the Danube-Black Sea Canal.<br \/>\nThe construction effort surpassed the resources available to the Romanian economy in the 1950s. The canal was assigned inferior machinery, part of which had already been used on the Soviet\u00a0Volga-Don Canal, and building had to rely on primitive techniques (most work appears to have been carried out using\u00a0shovels\u00a0and\u00a0pickaxes,\u00a0which was especially hard in the rocky terrain of\u00a0Northern Dobruja). Detainees were allocated to brigades, usually run by common criminals, which were encouraged to use violence against their subordinates.\u00a0In parallel, the region&#8217;s\u00a0industrialization, destined to assist in the building effort, was never accomplished.<br \/>\nSums allocated for prisoners&#8217; health, hygiene and nutrition declined dramatically over the years. Food rations were kept to a minimum, and prisoners would often resort to hunting mice and other small animals, or even consuming grass in an attempt to supplement their diet.<br \/>\nThe prisoners were dispossessed farmers who had attempted to resist\u00a0collectivization, former activists of the\u00a0National Peasants&#8217; Party, the\u00a0National Liberal Party, the\u00a0Romanian Social Democratic Party, and the\u00a0fascist\u00a0Iron Guard,\u00a0Zionist\u00a0Jews, as well as\u00a0Orthodox\u00a0and\u00a0Catholic\u00a0priests.\u00a0The canal was referred to as the &#8220;graveyard of the Romanian\u00a0bourgeoisie&#8221; by the Communist authorities,\u00a0and the physical elimination of undesirable\u00a0social classes\u00a0was one of its most significant goals.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Presidential Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Romania\u00a0presented an estimate of several thousand deaths among the political prisoners used in the project, significantly higher than 656 officially recorded by an official report from 1968.\u00a0Journalist\u00a0Anne Applebaum\u00a0had previously claimed that over 200,000 had died in its construction,\u00a0as a result of exposure, unsafe equipment, malnutrition, accidents, tuberculosis and other diseases, over-work, etc.,\u00a0while political analyst\u00a0Vladimir Socor\u00a0had estimated the number of deaths to be &#8220;considerably in excess of 10,000&#8221;.\u00a0As such, the project became known as\u00a0The Death Canal\u00a0(Canalul Mor\u021bii). It has also been called &#8220;a cloaca of immense human suffering and mortality&#8221;.<br \/>\nIn parallel, authorities left aside sectors of employment for skilled workers\u00a0\u2013 kept in strict isolation from all others,\u00a0they were attracted to the site with exceptional salaries (over 5,000\u00a0lei\u00a0per month), as well as for young people drafted into the\u00a0Romanian Army\u00a0and whose files indicated &#8220;unhealthy origins&#8221; (a\u00a0middle-class\u00a0family background). Their numbers fluctuated greatly (regular employees went from 13,200 in 1950 to 15,000 in 1951, to as little as 7,000 in early 1952, and again to 12,500 later in that year). At the same time, facilities meant to accommodate the projected influx of labor (including homes available on credit) were never actually completed.\u00a0This was overlooked by the\u00a0propaganda\u00a0machine, which furnished\u00a0Stakhanovite\u00a0stories instead, according to which work quotas were surpassed by as much as 170%.\u00a0Authorities also made the claim that the construction site was offering training to previously unskilled workers.<br \/>\nOn July 18, 1953, the project came to a discreet halt, all work being suspended for another 23 years\u00a0(according to some sources, the closure had been ordered by Stalin himself, as early as 1952).\u00a0The canal camps remained in existence for another year, and their prisoners progressively relocated, to similar conditions at other work sites in\u00a0Northern Dobruja. Penal facilities on the canal site were shut down in mid-1954.<br \/>\n<strong>Trial.<\/strong> Blame for the debilitating and unsuccessful works was eventually placed on a group of alleged\u00a0conspirators, who were indicted in a\u00a0show trial\u00a0(late 1952)\u00a0\u2013 they faced various trumped-up charges (espionage,\u00a0fraud,\u00a0sabotage). The inquiry was orchestrated by\u00a0Iosif Chi\u0219inevschi. Three people were executed (the engine driver\u00a0Nichita Dumitrescu, and the engineers\u00a0Aurel Rozei-Rozenberg\u00a0and\u00a0Nicolae Vasilescu-Colorado); others were imprisoned for various terms.\u00a0Defendants in a second group, around the engineer\u00a0Gheorghe Cr\u0103ciun, were sentenced to various harsh penalties (including three\u00a0life imprisonments).\u00a0Torture was applied by a\u00a0Securitate\u00a0squad led by\u00a0Alexandru Nicolschi, as a means to obtain\u00a0forced confessions.<br \/>\nConstruction. In June 1973, the project, with a complete new design,\u00a0was restarted by\u00a0Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu, who had previously ordered the\u00a0rehabilitation\u00a0of people sentenced in the 1952 trial,\u00a0and who aimed to withdraw the Lower Danube from Soviet control (which had been consecrated by the 1948\u00a0Danube Conference).\u00a0In official\u00a0propaganda, where the 1950s precedent was no longer mentioned,\u00a0the canal was referred to as the\u00a0Blue Highway\u00a0(Magistrala Albastr\u0103).\u00a0New and large machinery, produced inside Romania, was introduced to the site.\u00a0The southern arm was completed in May 1984, with the northern arm being inaugurated in October 1987.<br \/>\nThe cost of building the canal is estimated to be around 2 billion\u00a0dollars, and was supposed to be recovered in 50 years. However, as of 2005, it has a yearly income of only a little over 3 million\u00a0euros.<\/p>\n<p><strong>L&#8217;ensemble rupestre de Basarabi<\/strong> <strong>(Basarabi Cave Complex)<\/strong>.

A sandy barrier blocked the Danube bay where the river initially built its delta. Upon filling the bay with\u00a0sediment, the delta advanced outside this barrier-blocked estuary after 3500 BCE, building several successive lobes:\u00a0the St. George I (3500\u20131600 BCE), the Sulina (1600\u20130 BCE), the St. George II (0 BC\u2013present) and the Chilia or Kilia (1600 CE\u2013present). Several other internal lobes were constructed in the lakes and lagoons bordering the Danube Delta to the north (Chilia I and II) and toward the south (Dunavatz).\u00a0Much of the\u00a0alluvium\u00a0in the delta and major expansion of its surface area in the form of lobes resulted from\u00a0soil erosion\u00a0associated with the clearing of\u00a0forests\u00a0in the Danube basin during the\u00a01st\u00a0and 2nd millennium.\u00a0Probably 40 percent of the Delta was built in the last 1000 years. Finding that was like a eureka moment.<br \/>\nAt present the delta suffers from a large sediment deficit, after the construction of dams on the Danube and its tributaries in the later half of the 20th century. However, construction of a dense network of shallow channels in the delta over the same period attenuated the deficit on the delta plain but increased erosion along the coast.\u00a0The Danube Delta is a low\u00a0alluvial plain, mostly covered by\u00a0wetlands\u00a0and water. It consists of an intricate pattern of marshes, channels, streamlets and lakes. The average altitude is 0.52 m, with 20% of the territory below sea level, and more than half not exceeding one meter in altitude. Dunes on the most extensive\u00a0strand plains\u00a0of the delta (Letea and Caraorman strand plains) stand higher (12.4 m and 7 m respectively). The largest lakes are lakes Dranov (21.7\u00a0km2), Ro\u0219u (14.5\u00a0km2) and Gorgova (13.8\u00a0km2).<br \/>\n<strong>Distributaries of the Danube<\/strong>. The\u00a0Danube\u00a0branches into three main\u00a0distributaries\u00a0into the\u00a0delta,\u00a0Chilia,\u00a0Sulina, and\u00a0Sf\u00e2ntul Gheorghe\u00a0(Saint George). The last two branches form the\u00a0Tulcea\u00a0channel, which continues as a single body for several kilometers after the separation from the Chilia. At the mouths of each channel\u00a0gradual formation of new land\u00a0takes place, as the delta continues to expand. Chilia, in the north, the longest, youngest, and most vigorous, with two secondary internal deltas and one microdelta in full process of formation at its mouth (to Ukraine).<br \/>\nSulina, the central and thus the shortest arm, which consequently led to its extensive use for traffic and severe transformation. At its mouth is located the main port and a single settlement with urban characteristics of the Romanian part of the delta. Because of the\u00a0alluvium\u00a0deposited at its mouth, a channel gradually advancing into the sea (presently it has 10\u00a0km) was built in order to protect navigation.<br \/>\nSf\u00e2ntul Gheorghe\u00a0(Saint George\u00a0in\u00a0English), in the south, is the oldest and most sparsely populated. Its\u00a0alluvium\u00a0has led to the creation, beginning in 1897, of the\u00a0Sacalin Islands, which today measure 19\u00a0km in length.<br \/>\n<strong>Climate.<\/strong> The climate of the Danube Delta is continental, with strong influences from the vicinity of the\u00a0Black Sea\u00a0and its prevalent amphibian environment.

The Danube Delta falls within the\u00a0Pannonian steppe\u00a0ecosystem\u00a0of eastern Europe, with Mediterranean influences. As a young region in full process of consolidation, the Danube Delta represents a very favourable place for the development of highly diverse\u00a0flora\u00a0and\u00a0fauna, unique\u00a0in\u00a0Europe, with numerous rare species. It hosts 23 natural ecosystems, but due to the extent of\u00a0wetlands\u00a0an aquatic environment is prevalent; a terrestrial environment is also present on the higher grounds of the continental\u00a0levees, where\u00a0xerophile\u00a0ecosystems have developed. Between the aquatic and terrestrial environments is interposed a swampy, easily flooded strip of original flora and fauna, with means of adaptation to water or land, depending on the season or\u00a0hydrological\u00a0regime. At the contact between freshwater and sea water, some special physical, chemical and biological processes take place, which have led biologists to consider this area as a very different ecosystem called\u00a0beforedelta. Musura Gulf, north of Sulina, and Saint George Gulf are considered the most representative of this type of ecosystem.<br \/>\nSituated on major migratory routes, and providing adequate conditions for nesting and hatching, the Danube Delta is a magnet for birds from six major\u00a0ecoregions\u00a0of the world, including the Mongolian, Arctic and Siberian. There are over 320 species of birds found in the delta during summer,\u00a0of which 166 are hatching species and 159 are migratory. Over one million individual birds (swans, wild ducks,\u00a0coots, etc.) winter here.<br \/>\n<u>Ecosystem of running water.<\/u> This comprises the arms of the Danube, and a series of its more important streamlets and channels. It is an environment rich in\u00a0plankton,\u00a0worms,\u00a0molluscs,\u00a0grubs, and\u00a0sponges, with numerous species of fish, such as the\u00a0carp,\u00a0pike,\u00a0pike perch,\u00a0sheat-fish, and freshwater\u00a0sturgeons\u00a0(sterlet,\u00a0Vyza\u00a0and\u00a0Danube mackerel).<br \/>\n<u>Ecosystem of stagnant water<\/u>. This environment includes the lakes, and various ponds, streamlets and channels. It is characterized by a rich floating and submerse flora. Of the fish, the most important are\u00a0Tench,\u00a0common bream,\u00a0common rudd,\u00a0Prussian carp,\u00a0wels catfish,\u00a0European perch, and\u00a0northern pike.<br \/>\n<u>Ecosystem of marshy and flooding areas.<\/u> Reed plants and floating reed islands are the most common and well known components of the Danube Delta. They provide ideal spawning and nesting grounds. The\u00a0plaur\u00a0are a mixture of reed roots, grass and soil, usually floating or anchored to the riverbed. As a rule, the reed surrounds the lakes and ponds, and slowly invades the water surface.<br \/>\nThis type of ecosystem is noted for its variety and large population of birds, some of them very rare. The most important are the\u00a0tufted duck,\u00a0red-crested pochard,\u00a0mallard,\u00a0greylag goose,\u00a0pygmy cormorant,\u00a0purple heron,\u00a0great white egret,\u00a0little egret,\u00a0eurasian spoonbill,\u00a0great white pelican,\u00a0Dalmatian pelican,\u00a0mute swan, and\u00a0glossy ibis. A recent and welcomed newcomer is the\u00a0pheasant.<br \/>\nAmong the mammals, there is the\u00a0Eurasian otter,\u00a0European mink,\u00a0little ermine,\u00a0wild boar, and\u00a0wild cat, in winter the\u00a0hare and, on the brink of disappearing from the delta, the wolf and the fox. The\u00a0East Asian raccoon dog, bizam\/introduced\u00a0muskrat, and to some extent South American\u00a0nutria, are recent species that have successfully adapted.<br \/>\n<u>River bank and levee ecosystems<\/u>. The firm land of the delta used to be covered with large groves of willow trees, which have been cut down almost entirely and replaced with Canadian poplars. On the river banks kept in their natural state, small groves of willow trees can still be found, mixed with white poplar. Occasionally, the willow trees form corridors along the arms and bigger channels of the Danube. On the\u00a0levees\u00a0of\u00a0Letea\u00a0and\u00a0Caraorman, mixed forests of oak with various trees, shrubs, and vines grow on\u00a0sand dune\u00a0areas. On the Letea levee, these exotic-looking forests grow especially in the depressions between the sand dunes, in small groves called\u00a0hasmace. Fauna of this region include the\u00a0meadow viper,\u00a0osprey, and\u00a0Eurasian eagle owl.<br \/>\n<strong>Inhabitants.<\/strong> The Danube Delta is perhaps the least inhabited region of temperate\u00a0Europe.\u00a0On the Romanian side live about 20,000 people, of whom 4,600 live in the port of\u00a0Sulina, which gives an average density of approx. two inhabitants per km2. The rest of the population is scattered among 27 villages, of which only three, all situated marginally, had more than 500 people in 2002. The city of\u00a0Tulcea, at the western edge of the delta, has a population of 92,000 (in 2002); it represents the node of the region and the gate to the delta.<br \/>\nIts acute isolation and harsh conditions of living, based mainly on subsistence, made the Danube Delta a place of emigration, or transit at least. Very few of those born in the region stay there through adulthood; at the same time, the origins of its inhabitants vary widely, as people from many parts of\u00a0Romania\u00a0can be found in the delta. The total population has remained more or less constant throughout the 20th century; there were 12,000 inhabitants in the 1890s, and 14,000 before the Second World War.\u00a0Romanians\u00a0account for approximately 80% of the population, and\u00a0Ukrainians\u00a0for 10%. Other people living in the delta include ethnic minorities such as Greeks, Turks and Bulgarians (in 1992). Distinctive to the region, but very rare as an ethnic entity, are the\u00a0Lipovans, descendants of the Orthodox Old Rite followers who fled from religious persecution in\u00a0Russia\u00a0during the 18th century.<br \/>\nOn the Ukrainian side, located at the northern edge of the delta, the town of\u00a0Izmail\u00a0has a population of 85,000,\u00a0Kiliya\u00a0a population of 21,800, and\u00a0Vilkovo, the main center of the\u00a0Lipovan\u00a0community, a population of 9,300.<br \/>\n<strong>Environmental issues.<\/strong> Large-scale works began in the Danube Delta as early as the second half of the 19th century.\u00a0First corrections of the Sulina arm began in 1862, and they continued throughout the 20th century. As a result, the length of the Sulina arm was reduced from 92 to 64\u00a0km, and its flow more than doubled, thus making it suitable for large-vessel navigation. Correcting the six large\u00a0meanders\u00a0on its course thereby reduced the length of the Sf\u00e2ntu Gheorghe from 108\u00a0 to 108\u00a0km, and its flow also increased somewhat. Both these increases were made to the detriment of the Chilia arm, which at present remains the most unspoiled arm of the main three. These corrections, as well as the digging of various secondary channels throughout the body of the delta, have had a serious impact on the ecosystem. Natural environments have been altered, the breeding pattern of fish has been disrupted, and the flows in the main arms have increased, with serious consequences regarding the discharge of\u00a0alluvia\u00a0and the erosion of banks.<br \/>\nReed was intensively harvested during the\u00a0Communist\u00a0era. The regime had plans to transform the delta into a large agro-industrial zone. Although the first modern agricultural exploitation dates from 1939, only after 1960 were large areas drained and converted, to the detriment of the wetlands. In 1991 agricultural land in the delta surpassed 100,000 hectares, and more than a third of its surface has been affected by crop cultivation, forest plantation, or\u00a0pisciculture. As a result of these changes, along with the increasing pollution and\u00a0eutrophication\u00a0of the waters of the Danube, and decades of exploitation and poor fishing regulations, the fish population has been visibly reduced.<br \/>\nIn 2004, Ukraine inaugurated work on the\u00a0Bistroe Channel\u00a0that would provide an additional navigable link from the Black Sea to the populous Ukrainian section of the Danube Delta. However, because of the negative impact which this new channel might have on the fragile ecosystem of the delta, the\u00a0European Union\u00a0advised Ukraine to shut down the works. Romanian officials threatened to sue Ukraine at the\u00a0International Court of Justice. Under the presidency of\u00a0Kuchma, Ukraine had responded that Romania was only afraid of the competition that the new channel would bring, and continued working on the channel. Under the presidency of\u00a0Yuschenko, who visited Romania in 2005, both sides agree that professionals should decide the fate of the channel. In the long run, Ukraine plans to build a navigation channel, if not through Bistroe Channel, then through another channel.<br \/>\nThe Danube-Black Sea Canal was built to circumvent the\u00a0Danube Delta, which is difficult to navigate, to shorten the distance to the Black Sea, and several issues related to the loading and unloading of ships.<br \/>\nIn its delta, the Danube is divided into three main branches, none of which is suited to optimal navigation:\u00a0Chilia branch\u00a0is the deepest, but its mouths were not stable, which made navigation dangerous;\u00a0Sulina branch\u00a0is not deep enough for maritime ships to navigate on it and it also used to be isolated from the\u00a0railroad system;\u00a0Sf\u00e2ntu Gheorghe branch\u00a0is shallow and sinuous.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TULCEA<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Danube Delta Aquarium and National Park Visitor\u2019s Center<\/strong>.
