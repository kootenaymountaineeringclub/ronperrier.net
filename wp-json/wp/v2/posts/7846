It provides excellent views of Nakusp, Upper Arrow Lake, and a portion of Slocan Lake. On a sunny June day, Leah Zoobkoff and I made a trip to this easy, walk-up summit. As is often the case, road access is the key, so here it is. Approaching from the south, turn right off Hwy.6 at the signed Wilson Lake road, about 9 km. north of Summit Lake Provincial Park. Reset your odometer, pass alongside Box Lake lumberyard, and make the following turns: km. 3.5 left (signed); km. 5.3 right; km. 6.5 right; km. 7.5 left; km. 8.1 left; km. 9.7 left; km. 10.9 right.

Access from Highway 6 is two-wheel drive.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Starting on foot at 10:05, Leah and I followed this spur road, which deteriorated into a watercourse and then became an ATV track\/trail. In about 90 min., we reached a frozen lake at 6540\u2019 (559-590), where the trail ends. Continuing west on snow and over alps, we reached the north end of our peak\u2019s north-south ridge at 551-591 and hiked along the easy ridge crest to the summit at the south end by 1:10 pm. After savouring views of the Gold Range, Mt. Fosthall, the Pinnacles, and all of the Goat Range, we re-traced our steps to the truck in just under two hours for a 5 hr. 50 min. day. There are opportunities for kilometres of walking along the open ridge line east of Summit Peak.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Kim Kratky<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SUMMIT PEAK\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a02272m\u00a0 \u00a07454&#8242; Summit Peak, in the Nakusp Range, is located above Summit Lake on Highway 6 and is visible from the highway.
