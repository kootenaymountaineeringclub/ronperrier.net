At a young age, he wired the family house for electricity, and in grade school, developed dry cells with solid electrolyte cores (portable as they didn\u2019t contain corrosive liquid that could slosh and spill), enabling portable electronic devices. He was never content with the accumulated scientific knowledge of his day. At age 13, he installed an intercom system in a Carmelite convent. Despite early recognition from his elders, Gernsbacher felt like an outsider. He wrote a novel called \u201cA Jinxed Person\u201d or \u201cA Schlemiel\u201d about a hapless, unworldly boy whose obsessive tinkering constantly got him into trouble.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In 1903, he moved to the US and started the Electro Importing Company, the country&#8217;s first mail-order supplier for home electronics buffs. At age 19, he was already managing two start-ups.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">He was also a genius at marketing. The vast catalogue promoted his products as hip accessories for a 20th-century lifestyle based on scientific discovery and excitement. His branding proved to be catnip for nerdy outcasts, who became heroic young \u201cexperimenters\u201d in the pages of his catalogues. He opened a retail store with a precocious knack for salesmanship by offering 10-cent crystal detectors that could pick up any radio signals in the area. Soon, he was selling a thousand a day. These simple semiconductor devices were only a come-along for the first radio transmitter and receiver kit designed for amateurs, the Telimco Wireless Telegraph selling for $7.50 instead of the $50,000 cost of a standard commercial rig. It allowed ham operators to transmit and receive Morse code snippets over a mile range. The kits flew off the shelves and were also marketed at department stores. Within a year, the Telimco would also transmit and receive voice signals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But he inevitably struck people as odd, rude, self-centred, and even callous. He predicted it would not be long before the caller could see your face over the wires. In 1908, he launched the first magazine (<em>Modern Electronics<\/em>) for ham radio operators, a powerful vehicle for promoting his business. The marvels of the world of the future could be soldered together in a garage from off-the-shelf parts. Its motto was \u201cThe Electrical Magazine for Everybody\u201d. The magazine embraced many innovations beyond amateur radio, featuring articles, editorials, special issues on airships, electronic photography, radiotelegraphy, model railroading, and a proto-Internet scheme for \u201ctypewriting by wire\u201d.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The December 1909 issue was devoted to television. His international correspondents also tackled such far-out subjects as the potential for harnessing tides and sunlight as limitless power sources. In 1910, he inaugurated a genre of popular storytelling that blended hard science and speculative fiction, with a strong emphasis on gadgetry, calling it \u201cscientifiction,\u201d which was quickly superseded by \u201cscience fiction\u201d. He anticipated various technological marvels, including TV, radar, fluorescent lighting, stainless steel, videophones, night baseball games, speech-to-text software, wireless power transmission, and electronic weather control. His prophecies were unusually accurate as he befriended someone already living in the future, Nikola Tesla.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">He was brilliant at fostering the formation of communities of shared interest. He published his subscribers\u2019 names, radio call numbers, and addresses in a wireless registry that appeared at the back of <em>Modern Electrics<\/em>, and in three years, his circulation base soared from 8,000 to 52,000, by creating a decentralized network of radio enthusiasts who could get in touch with one another directly over the airwaves or by mail. He provided his magazines and gadgets with an ever-expanding market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In the mid-1920s, Gernsback turned his full attention to growing the market for science fiction. He launched a new publication devoted to the genre, Amazing Stories. It represented not just the emergence of a form of popular literature but the dawn of a new sensibility, embodied by coolly rational, sardonic, tech-savvy heroes. The bold tagline\u2014\u201cExtravagant Fiction Today, Cold Fact Tomorrow\u201d\u2014practically dared its readers to build labs in their garages and help invent the marvellous future.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Within a decade, bookstore shelves and drugstore racks throughout the United States and Europe were bulging with knockoff titles, such as <em>Air Wonder Stories<\/em>, <em>Science Wonder Quarterly<\/em>, and <em>Astounding Stories of Super-Science<\/em>. Printed on coarse, untrimmed wood-pulp pages, these affordable gateways to awe and mystery (cover price, ten cents) became collectively known as <em>the pulps<\/em>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The contemporary culture of fandom in America \u2013 the thriving multiverse of Trekkers, Whovians, Twihards, and Potterheads \u2013 had humble beginnings in the letters-to-the-editor column of Amazing Stories. He printed his readers\u2019 names and addresses along with their letters. The exchanges in this column were often more sophisticated than the stories around them. There was more fervent discussion of Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity in the letter column of <em>Amazing Stories<\/em> than in mainstream science journals.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Soon, pulp fans everywhere started compiling networks of pen pals. This led to organizations like the Science Correspondents Club in Chicago and the Scienceers, a group of New York City teens who met in the Harlem apartment of its first president, Warren Fitzgerald, an African American space buff. Using early methods of duplication like mimeography and hectography, these groups churned out hand-stapled publications with names like the Comet and The Planet \u2013 the first \u201cfanzines\u201d in history.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As an editor, Gernsback was primarily a hardware man. He favoured galactic stories with fantastic gizmos, cunning contraptions, and diabolical engines of mayhem (death rays were a perennial favourite). Sutler masters of the art later ridiculed this, in which technology took precedence over psychology, and plot and character were secondary to product placement. One learned a lot about the tools of the future, but very little about the people who used them. Nuances of interpersonal interaction were irrelevant; women existed as hapless props to be rescued, and heroes were monastically chaste.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It\u2019s a reasonable assumption that Gernsback was an undiagnosed Aspergian. Though Gernsback\u2019s career as an inventor was overshadowed by Tesla\u2019s (whose wasn\u2019t?), he earned more than 80 patents in his lifetime, encompassing a range of innovations including the first walkie-talkie, one of the first bone-conducting hearing aids, a design for TV glasses (complete with a tiny aerial, and a submersible Ferris wheel. His most blatantly autistic creation was a contraption for reducing distracting sensory input in noisy offices called \u201cthe Isolator.\u201d It looked like a deep-sea diver in a particularly cumbersome helmet, complete with a private air supply furnished by a nearby tank. With outside noises eliminated, the worker can easily concentrate on the subject.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When Gernsback died in 1967, many of his predictions were coming true; TV made its debut in 1928, and 172 spacecraft left the Earth\u2019s surface that year alone. The groundwork was laid for a global network that would make the wireless revolution look quaint.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>NICOLA TESLA<\/strong><br \/>\nThe brilliant Serbian inventor\u2019s wireless experiments preceded those of the \u201cfather of the radio, Guglielmo Marconi, a former lab assistant of Thomas Edison\u2019s. Tesla did trailblazing research in various fields, including robotics, home lighting, X-rays, proto-transistors, remote control, and alternating current. He even predicted 21st-century warfare, semiautonomous drones, which he called Telautomata. \u201cWhen wireless is perfectly applied, the whole earth will be converted into a huge brain,\u201d Tesla told an interviewer in 1926. \u201cWe shall be able to communicate instantly, irrespective of distance. We shall see and hear one another as perfectly as we were face to face, despite intervening distances of thousands of miles. The instruments to do this will be carried in your vest pocket.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Whatever Tesla was, the word typical didn\u2019t describe him. Eccentric genius ran in his family: his mother was an expert weaver from a long line of inventors who designed her sewing tools. His older brother was a child prodigy who died when Tesla spooked the horse he was riding. He suffered as a boy from what would now be diagnosed as epilepsy. He could be honest when his two elderly aunts asked him to choose which one was prettier, and he replied that one was \u201cnot as ugly as the other\u201d. He felt compelled to calculate the precise volume of coffee cups, soup bowls, and morsels of food at the table. He counted the exact number of steps he took when walking (like Cavendish and Dirac, he walked 8-10 miles daily in Manhattan in a rigid timetable).\u00a0 Tesla developed rigid habits, aversions, and a fascination for specific shapes as a teenager. The mere sight of a pearl made him feel ill, but the glittering objects with flat surfaces mesmerized him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">He embarked on his career as an inventor when he discovered he could visualize theoretical machines in minute detail. He even set them running in his mind, tweaking his design as parts wore out. \u201cI needed no models, drawings, or experiments,\u201d Tesla recalled in his memoir. \u201cI could picture them all as real&#8230; Whether I run my turbine in thought or test it in my shop is immaterial to me. I even note if it is out of balance.\u00a0 (Temple Grandin\u2019s account of her design process is virtually identical: I test-run the equipment in my imagination before I attempt any construction. I visualize my designs being used in every possible situation, with different sizes and breeds of cattle and in various weather conditions. Doing this enables me to correct mistakes before construction.\u201d)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Gernsback, who was 28 years younger, became Tesla\u2019s most prominent advocate. The first theme issue of Modern Electrics was wholly devoted to Tesla\u2019s work. Gernsback, the inventor and the editor, forged a mutually beneficial alliance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Tesla died in 1943, impoverished and emaciated in his room at the Hotel New Yorker with a \u201cdo not disturb\u201d sign permanently affixed to his door.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>HUGO GERNSBACK (1884-1967) The son of a wine merchant in Luxembourg, he became fascinated with electricity.
