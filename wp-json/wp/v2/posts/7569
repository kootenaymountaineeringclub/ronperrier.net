This peak is a favourite ascent of local climbers. The south summit (invisible from Gibson Lake) is the higher.

The view is accurate from the north but is reversed.\u00a0<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">1. <strong>North Ridge.<\/strong> Follow the trail from the parking lot at Gibson Lake until the last sign to the trail on the upper road. Continue on the road a short distance to the mine portal and mine tailings pile. Enter the woods above and behind the portal and travel through light brush following a small water course on its left side. The brush gives way to open grassy slopes beneath some rocky bluffs. Climb up and over the bluffs and work your way straight up until you reach a well-defined gully with a stream entering from the left of your line of travel. At this point look up to your right and Grays Peak is visible with an edge of the glacier showing. Traverse meadows to the right (southeast; northwest goes toward Cond Peak) and sidehill left up to a ridge which separates you from the access pass. The ridge can be penetrated in two spots (vegetation). Quite low on the ridge there is an obvious grassy ramp used by goats. When you reach the ridge, the route to the low pass (col) between Kokanee Peak and Grays Peak is obvious. Keep high, and scramble over a rocky rib to gain the pass. From this point, it is 45 minutes on snow to the top. (But on return, it is difficult to find one\u2019s way down to the mine )<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">It is wise to carry a rope and crampons, as well as an ice axe because the top of the final snow slope is very steep.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">One can also use Route 2 of Cond Peak, and bear southeast along the alps above the cliffs, but it is quite long (Kokanee Peak descent route, alternate).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Glacier (III,4,s). <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><em>FA unknown.<\/em>\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">See Kokanee Peak for the descent (from the Grays-Kokanee col) and also the alternate below.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><br \/>\nAlternate Approach (or Descent)<br \/>\n<\/strong>The above approach is inefficient because one must traverse southeast (right), and then traverse northwest on the return (long) if one does not wish to bushwhack down. In the early season, when there is snow, it is better to take a more direct line (roughly the line followed by the bushwhack down, see Kokanee Peak). Take the old steep trail (on the hillside at the parking lot at Gibson Lake) until it meets the road. Follow the road uphill and around a switchback until the road crosses a small stream. Head uphill through the bush keeping to the right of the stream, and follow the openings up to the treeline at about 2130m (7000 feet) and then to the col.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">A trail cut along this route would save much effort.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">2. <strong>Southwest Ridge of North Summit.<\/strong> Approach as for Route 1, but traverse right to the southwest ridge. Ascend the Class 4 ridge and avoid some of the gendarmes by moving right. The long ridge arrives at the north summit of Grays Peak and the regular route to the higher south summit is followed (snow, glacier).

Three roped leads (a ramp, a real easy lead, and a thin wall) gave way to hundreds of feet of scrambling.
