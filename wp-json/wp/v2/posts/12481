A<\/span>nalysis of the mosque&#8217;s wooden timbers shows that they date back to 1206, less than 100 years after Seljuk Turks routed the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert and began settling in Anatolia.\u00a0There is no record of the date of construction but according to radiocarbon tests, the mosque was built in 1206 and the porch in front in 1335.<em>\u00a0<\/em>Several kinds of trees were used &#8211; elm, ash, and chestnut.\u00a0The planks are approximately 15-18 cm thick, 50-70 cm wide and approximately 12-20m.\u00a0long.\u00a0No nails were used in the structure except some\u00a0wrought iron nails to connect the column heads to the beams and in the annexes. There is a large entrance and then the mosque itself with the roof supported by 6 wood columns and a system of beams.<\/p>\n<p>The interior ceiling decorations of the building date from the early Ottoman period and are classical motifs and composition patterns still quite bright.<br \/>\nThe mihrab is a simple wood projection.

A covered porch surrounds three sides. With no minaret or dome, it is completely\u00a0portable.\u00a0\u00a0The building underwent a comprehensive restoration in 2007 and\u00a0still serves as a temple today.\u00a0I was alone.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>G\u00f6\u011fceli Mosque.\u00a0Located near the town of \u00c7ar\u015famba, around 40kms east of Samsun, in the middle the huge Muslim Tea G\u00f6\u011fcel graveyard, this is easily the most unusual mosque I have ever been to.
