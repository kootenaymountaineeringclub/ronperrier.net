The past decade has witnessed enormous cul\u00adtural changes in the Purcell Trench, that major N-S valley that contains the Duncan River in the north and Kootenay Lake m the South. Several old roads and trails leading E into the Purcell Range have been extended and\/or improved and many miles of new road have been constructed. Thus, the arduous, multi-day approaches up the long lateral valleys extending W from the Columbia River and then over the Purcell D1v1de, which for\u00admerly were necessary to reach such places as the Four Squat\u00adters or the Macbeth Snowfield, have been rendered obsolete. Instead, relatively short and easy western routes-maybe too easy-have made many of these peaks accessible even on a long weekend! Furthermore, the fact that commercial exploitai\u00adtion underlies the opening-up of this country makes the improved access something of a mixed blessing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>ACCESS: <\/strong>(1976)<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>The most significant change in terms of mountaineering ac\u00adcess has been the extension of the E side road on Duncan River and the building of a road along the E shore of Kootenay Lake. At the village of Cooper Creek, near where Duncan River joins Kootenay Lake, a main road crosses to the E side of the Purcell Trench. A N branch extends to a point beyond where East Creek, which supplies W drainage from the Bugaboos, flows into Duncan River some 7 mi N of Healy Landing. Branching E from this road, a logging road goes about 16 mi up Glacier Creek to the vicinity of Jumbo Pass, along the way giving access to the Macbeth Group and W portions of the Truce Group. From Cooper Creek, the main S branch goes via Argenta to Johnson&#8217;s Landing, about 9 mi down the E shore of Kootenay Lake. Argenta is the W terminus of the Centennial Trail&#8221;, newly cleared and upgraded, which extends up Hamill Creek to Earl Grey Pass, continuing E down Toby Creek. At Johnson&#8217;s Landing, a fire road (4-wheel drive) heads E up Kootenay Joe Creek to the height of land and then drops SE along Seven Mile Creek to reach Carney Creek just above the latter&#8217;s junction with Fry Creek, of which it is a major tributary. The fire road continues another 5 mi up Car\u00adney Creek (see Mt Pambrun). A trail along Fry Creek connects with the fire road near the Fry-Carney confluence and itself goes some 3 mi farther up Fry Creek.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Farther S on Kootenay Lake, an important road heads N from Kootenay Bay along the E shore. Passing through Rion\u00addel, it terminates about 9 mi farther N at the mouth of Powder Creek, which is almost directly across Kootenay Lake from Kaslo. A branch road extends approx. 5 mi up Powder Creek. In the lateral valley next S, that of Bernard Creek, there is also a road about 7 mi in length. Thus, only the 13-mi section of the E shore between Johnson&#8217;s Landing and Powder Creek is not served by a road connecting to the outside. It is somewhat frustrating that in just this particular stretch is located Campbell Creek which provides the most reasonable access to the Leaning Towers, probably the most interesting peaks in the W Purcells. But perhaps their very inaccessibility makes them even more worthwhile.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The user should note that the condition of all but principal roads is uncertain. From year to year, washouts, blowdowns, slides, collapsed bridges, etc. may make a given road impass\u00ad able, to cars if not to backpackers. Moreover, logging and min\u00ading companies may cease to maintain a road once they have removed the resource. It is wise to inquire locally or check with the BC Forest Service which has stations in this district at Kaslo and Lardeau.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>LITERATURE<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">McCoubrey, A.

The glaciated portion of the group extends E-W for a distance of 6 miles and supports 7 main peaks (over 9500&#8242;), the highest attaining 10070&#8242;.<\/em><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>The N side of the group bears several glaciers, the longest, 2\u00bd mi, all of which drain to East Creek.

A successful ap\u00adproach was made via the S branch of Bugaboo Glacier, passing S of Thimble Peak. On the long ridge extending from Thimble Peak to the Squatters, the party broke their approach march by 3 camps.

B. Beck then made a one-day solo circuit of 4 high points (CAJ 48-86, map with peaks numbered E to W). In July 1972, a party consisting of G. Brown, B. Port, and H.

In view of the improved road situation along Duncan River, approaches from the W now supersede the multi-day excursions from the Bugaboos.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">These peaks have scant relief above the surrounding extensive snowfields and possess little mountaineering interest.
