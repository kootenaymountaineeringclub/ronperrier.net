During the early 1900s, a trail and wagon road traversed the valley bottom with the trail continuing over the height of land into Pedro and Winlaw creeks. A small narrow gauge logging railway was constructed to haul logs to a small mill set up in the valley. A flume enabled the loggers to get the rough-cut lumber to a planer mill near the Kootenay River. Settlers living along the flume were allowed to take irrigation water from the flume during the night by way of small gates. During the day all the water would be needed for fluming the lumber. Wildfires devastated it in the 1930s.\u00a0<\/span><\/em><br \/>\n<em><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It is hikeable most of the year and very convenient if you live in Nelson.\u00a0<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Difficulty:<\/strong> A1 easy<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Elevation gain:<\/strong> 262m (860&#8242;)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Distance:<\/strong> 4.9 km one-way<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Time:<\/strong> 3-4 hours round trip<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Season:<\/strong> April through November<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Access:<\/strong> Easy\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Map:<\/strong> 82F\/11 Kokanee.
