Over the course of the eighteenth century the defence system around St George&#8217;s gradually evolved on the ridges of the hills that enclose St. George&#8217;s and its natural harbour like a giant amphitheatre. In its heydays the system consisted of eight forts, designed to mitigate internal Amerindian attacks and slave uprisings, as well as external European rival invasions. At the time of their establishment, each fort progressively incorporated the latest design concepts to facilitate advancing technological achievements of the period, showing today the development of French .and British military engineering adjusted to Grenadian circumstances. The three major forts of the system have been preserved to the present day. Fort George is associated with all the periods of Grenada&#8217;s history up to its contemporary period, as the execution of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop in October 1983 was carried out at Fort George. The fort currently houses the Police Headquarters and Police Training School. Fort Frederick is restored and is open to the public. Fort Matthew was converted into a lunatic asylum to serve the entire Windward Island in 1880 and was abandoned in 1987 when a new asylum at Mt. Gay was opened. It is currently in a bad state of repair. The other military structures have either disappeared or fallen to ruins.<br \/>\n<strong>Fort Frederick\u00a0<\/strong>high above the sea with outstanding views of St. George\u00b4s, Grand Anse, Grand Etang and the southern part of the island.<br \/>\n<strong>Fort George<\/strong>\u00a0above the main town of St. George\u00b4s with a beautiful view of the town and the Carenage.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>St. GEORGE HISTORIC DISTRICT<\/em>.\u00a0<\/strong>Tentative WHS (05\/08\/2004).\u00a0The urban pattern has a planned part and an unplanned part, physically and visually partly separated by the ridge of a mountain on which the main landmarks of the town have been erected (Church Street) and as such has evolved as the spine of St George&#8217;s. The planned part of the town was laid out on a grid system with a central square and has developed predominantly over the course of the eighteenth century after fires had razed the town in 1771 and 1775, requiring buildings to be made of brick or masonry with clay tile roofs and laid out as detached units instead of row houses. The original urban plan has remained intact since then and a large body of Georgian architecture adjusted to Caribbean circumstances has been preserved.<br \/>\nThe unplanned part has been shaped by the form of the natural harbour of St George&#8217;s and the contour lines of the surrounding hills and developed from the early nineteenth century onwards.

The Grenadines are a group of 35 small islands located between Grenada and St. Vincent in the Windward Islands of the Lesser Antilles. They stretch over a distance of 90 km from the Island of London Bridge in the south to Bequia in the north. The natural boundary of the site approximates to the Grenadine Shelf, which is some 50m deep and falls off steeply in the Tobago Trough. Geographically, the area lies along the interface of the Caribbean and South American Tectonic plates. Several active undersea mounts (e.g. Kick\u2019em Jenny) attest to the on-going movement of these plates.<br \/>\nThe international boundary between Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines runs east to west across the bank between Petit Martinique and Petit St. Vincent. Nonetheless, the links among all the Grenadine Islands on both sides of the boundary are historically strong and continue to be active. Fishing, informal trade, tourism and island social life proceed with little attention to the boundary. In both countries \u2018mainlanders\u2019 concede that the connections among the Grenadine islands are in most cases stronger than those with the main island.<br \/>\nEfforts by the two countries to conserve coral reef biodiversity can be seen as contributing to reef biodiversity conservation at the regional level.<br \/>\nIn the Grenadines there are nine (9) islands with permanent settlements. The largest islands \u2013 Bequia, Mustique, Canouan, Mayreau, Union I., Petit Martinique and Carriacou, have towns and communities with public (schools, clinics, utilities) and private supporting infrastructure. Others are resort islands- Palm I, Petit St. Vincent. Most others are visited by yachters and fishers.<br \/>\nThe islands of the Grenadines range from rocky volcanic headlands to tiny cays that barely rise above sea level. The largest islands are Carriacou in Grenada (3400 ha) and Bequia in St. Vincent (1800 ha). Although many of the islands are inhabited and used for agriculture and the surrounding waters for commercial fishing, much of the area still exists in a relatively undisturbed condition.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>CARRIACOU<\/em><br \/>\nCarriacou Museum<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Old Sugar Mill<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong><em>Festivals:\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>Carriacou Maroon and String Band Music Festival<\/p>\n<p><strong>PETITE MARTINIQUE<\/strong>\u00a0XL:<br \/>\n<strong>DO<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Festivals<em><br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Grenada Chocolate Festival<br \/>\nGrenada Drum Festival<br \/>\nSpice Mas Festival<br \/>\n<strong>Experiences<\/strong>: Try or Learn how to make rum<br \/>\n<strong>Gouyave Fish Friday<\/strong>.
