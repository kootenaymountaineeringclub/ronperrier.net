It offers a superb opportunity to enjoy an extended ridge walk through alpine and subalpine terrain. If the entire ridge is walked, it is 25 km from the trailhead on American Creek Road to the trailhead on Dirt Road. There is not a continuous trail along the ridge, it is a combination of a clearly defined trail, an <\/em><em>abandoned mining road <\/em><em>and a cairned route. Good footgear, map reading and navigation skills are required. Travelling the ridge in poor weather is not recommended.<br \/>\n<\/em><em>It is one of the most panoramic trails in the Kootenays, especially with the 24.5km-long, turquoise Trout Lake forming the view to the south. Once on top, you stay up, cruising near tree line. There are many campsites and tarns and trickles are frequent, so water is plentiful. Meadows are extensive. Wildflowers are profuse in late July.<br \/>\nUnfortunately, the mining activity has left unsightly scars and you will share the trail with ATVs and horses. Bring a topographical map and a compass or GPS. The trail is maintained by the Kaslo Riding Society.\u00a0<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Difficulty:<\/strong> E3<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Elevation gain:<\/strong> 1156m (3792&#8242;)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Key elevations:<\/strong> NW trailhead 1230m (4035&#8242;); Triune Mountain 2629m (8625&#8242;); Fay&#8217;s Peak 2828m (9242&#8242;)<strong>,\u00a0<\/strong>SE trailhead 2120m (6955&#8242;)<br \/>\n<strong>Distance:<\/strong> 26km\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Time:<\/strong> 4-5 days\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Season:<\/strong> early July to late September<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Assess:<\/strong> difficult\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Map:<\/strong> 82K\/11 Trout Lake<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Drive<\/strong>: Reaching the trailhead at either end can require the use of a 4WD depending on conditions.

It doesn&#8217;t climb high and should be negotiable by a strong 2WD. High clearance is helpful, 4WD is probably unnecessary. Overgrown so likely will scratch your paint.

Or you can shoulder your pack and walk up the road.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">11.9km Park where boulders block the road to all vehicular traffic.\u00a0There is a parking area for about 3 vehicles, with room to turn around.<br \/>\nFrom the boulder barricade to the ridge, the trail follows the road through subalpine and alpine terrain. Panoramic views into the Lardeau Range and Goat Range and an abundance of wildflowers enhance the walk up to the ridge. Upon cresting the ridge, there is an intriguing view into Healy Creek and across to Mt. Aldridge and Razors Edge.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Access via Rue du Beau (Copper Queen Road):<\/strong> 9.3km from Trout Lake \/ 18km from Gerrard.

Park. 2070m (6790&#8242;).<br \/>\nAlthough it is possible to drive almost the entire length of Silvercup Ridge on this mining road, please, refrain from leaving the road as the alpine and subalpine meadows are very fragile. The original old trail can be accessed by foot from many places along the mining road. One of the best places is just where the Copper Queen Road meets the road along the ridge. From here the trail is just above the mining road. Turn left or right to explore either end of the ridge.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Trail:<\/strong> From the parking area on Dirt Road, walk through cut blocks for a kilometre, steadily climbing and crossing a few creeks. Reach small clearings with views through the trees. Reach a lovely pond on the ridge. After 2 hours at 6100 feet, the path levels after a 2065-foot climb. After 20 minutes reach the first viable campsite in heather meadows. Progressive views of mountains appear.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">6.4 km 3 hours 2040m (6500&#8242;) Great viewpoint 4345 feet above Trout Lake. The trail descends off the ridge into a small ravine and intersects an old mining road. Walk on the road for 3.6 km. <strong>\/<\/strong>\u00a0Triune Mountain (2629m 8625&#8242;) is on the ridge to the north.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">7 km. Access trail that goes through nice alpine. The scenery is fantastic and camping is available in many places. Small alpine tarns and small mountains are on the ridge.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">7.7 km Junction Rue du Beau.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">10.1 km Lakelet just below the road has sheltered camping, but few views. The mining road ends soon. A tarn in a broad meadowy pass (2256m 7400&#8242;) is one of the best campsites. Best scenery so far.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">18.5 km. Lovely long tarn at 2238m (7340&#8242;). One of the best campsites. Rady Creek Mining Road. Route uses road and trail. Great panoramas persist. The route through long sections of meadow is marked by cairns. At the next shoulder, a grand view opens at the Ottawa Creek viewpoint. East is 2828m (9242&#8242;) <strong>Fay&#8217;s Peak<\/strong> with a glacier on its north face. Descend into the pass between Ottawa Creek and Stobart Creek and ascend the south outlier of Fay&#8217;s. There is no specific trail here, so follow cairns and flagging.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Round the 8200-foot bump on the crest and just southeast of it at 7750 feet, encounter an old mining road that continues with ups and downs around each watershed all the way to the trailhead. Pass old mine diggings and buildings. Reach a ridge crest and the route descends into Horsefly Creek and\u00a0 Silvercup&#8217;s southeast trailhead at 27kilometres (2120m 6955&#8242;). Hopefully, your shuttle vehicle will be waiting at the mine site.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This old pack trail was built to access mining claims scattered along Silver Cup Ridge in the Badshot Range of the Selkirk Mountains.
