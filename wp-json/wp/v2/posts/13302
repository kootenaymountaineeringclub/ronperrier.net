Part of the 1133-hectare Stagleap Provincial Park, the pass is famous for its early and late season snow as well as being the highest-served pass in BC that is open year-round (closed occasionally for avalanche danger).<br \/>\nThis area is a popular backcountry skiing\/snowshoeing destination in the winter. Unlike resort-based routes, the ski tours are all completely backcountry. There are no lifts, no lodges and no people nearby.
