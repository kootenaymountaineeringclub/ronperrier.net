Besides, she was buoyed after subduing the neighbouring Erie Mtn., also on \u2018shoes\u2019, only days earlier. Only two others, Janice Isaac and I were mad enough to join her as we departed Nelson at 7:30 on a foggy, drizzly weekend morning. It wasn\u2019t at all heroic, and a clammy white mist enveloped us much of the way up, but we did reach the top. Details follow. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">We turned off Highway 3 about 3 km. west of Salmo, onto the Erie Rd. access, just east of Erie Creek Bridge. Then we drove north until the recently plowed portion ended, parked at the km. 1 sign, and headed out at 8:20. After 30 min. of tramping on the snow-machine-packed mainline, we turned right or east onto the signed and gated \u201cWhiskey Creek Road\u201d (about 757-509), just north of a bridge over Whiskey, or Hooch, as it is on my map. Thanks to good snowmobile packing, we made excellent time on Whiskey, finally turning left onto a northern spur called \u201cGary\u2019s Road\u201d (772-519), which was also nicely packed to its end at 782-529, 4750\u2019. We then headed up a huge, denuded cutblock, kept to the left of a shallow watercourse, passed into timber, and soon reached a ridge. Here, we turned right and in minutes reached the timbered summit at 11:55 (3 hrs. 35 min. up). <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">We enjoyed a brief 25 min. lunch in steady snowfall and \u20131 C temps, congratulating ourselves on the excellent snowshoeing conditions (no, I\u2019m not being sarcastic) all the way to the top. Return was via the ascent route in 2 hrs. 20 min. for a total day of 6 hrs. 20 min. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Good access, good exercise, and we never got rained on. Of course, the fog lifted on the way down, so that we finally got some minor views. There might be some good spring skiing in the massive west- and southwest-facing cutblocks in the upper Whiskey (or is it Hooch?) drainage. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Kim Kratky<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>KEYSTONE MTN 1663m\u00a0 5456\u2019\u00a0Jan. 29 by Kim Kratky Map Salmo 82F\/3) As the skiing has been so beastly lately, trip coordinator Sandra McGuinness deemed a snowshoe ascent of the Bonnington Range\u2019s dread Keystone Mtn., 4.5 km. north of Salmo, to &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2017\/11\/11\/keystone-mt\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-8200","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-uncategorized"],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p2Ncip-28g","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8200","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8200"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8200\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":20367,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8200\/revisions\/20367"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8200"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8200"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8200"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
