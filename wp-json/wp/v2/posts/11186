Famous for the 1984 Olympics and the Bosnian war, it sits surrounded by low mountains.<br \/>\nIn a referendum boycotted by the Bosnian Serbs in March 1992, the citizens voted 60% to leave the Yugoslav republic. On the next day, the JNA (Yugoslav People\u2019s Army composed of Bosnian Serbs and Serbia laid siege to Sarajevo. Lasting 1,425 days until 1995, they invaded parts of the city and shelled it from batteries surrounding the city. An average of 330 shells\/day rained onto the streets and buildings killing 11,541 people (1,601 children) and injuring 50,000. On July 22, 1993, the record 3,707 shells were shot. 400 explosion scars were painted with a red resin and called Sarajevo roses &#8211; a few of these still exist.<br \/>\nThe city was completely blockaded (humanitarian supplies by road, water, food, electricity, and fuel) except for a United Nations-controlled area at the Sarajevo Airport. 20-25 humanitarian flights conducted by the UN starting in July 1992 brought in 90% of all supplies with 10 tons of goods arriving daily by plane.<br \/>\nThe Serbs targeted all communication services (4 TV towers, newspaper offices), hospitals (55% destroyed), symbols of the city (the Olympic facilities; 2 million books in the library were destroyed) and schools. White phosphorus shells were used to start fires. Snipers from the hills controlled all major intersections \u2013 initially, they shot to kill but then changed their tactics to only injure. Mines were placed everywhere. Smuggled cigarettes became the main currency. Basic items like stoves and lighting were handmade showing great ingenuity. Human dynamos (bicycles connected to batteries) supplied much of the power. Most of the trees in the city were cut down for fuel. The sterilizer in the hospital was an antique burning wood.<br \/>\nIn the first 2 months of the war, convoys carried mostly children and women out to of the city. The Dayton Peace Accord (signed in Dayton Ohio) ended the war on November 14, 1995. The total economic cost of the war was almost 14 billion US$.<br \/>\nThe museum is in the Kolar house and shows artifacts pertinent to the tunnel.

As a result, a tunnel was built to move supplies into the city and became the main reason the city survived. It carried fuel lines, electricity cables and phone lines. It was originally 800m long, 1m wide and 1.6m high and crossed under the airport runway between the Kolar and Sloboda family houses on either side. It took over 3 months to build in 1993. Ventilation was an issue. In 994, tracks were laid so that supplies and injured could be carried in carriages. The tunnel was constantly flooded and rubber boots were necessary. It was open for 2 hours alternately each way. After the tunnel was a long trench from the Sloboda house into the city.<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.viator.com\/Sarajevo-attractions\/Sarajevo-Tunnel\/d22427-a24628\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwiG1p7ukaLiAhWRCuwKHee7DZYQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/cache-graphicslib.viator.com\/graphicslib\/page-images\/742x525\/380038_tunnels.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Sarajevo War Tunnel.\" width=\"563\" height=\"398\" data-iml=\"1558081489938\" \/><\/a><strong><em><br \/>\n<\/em>Alija Izetbegovic Museum.<\/strong> This museum is dedicated to Alija Izetbegovi\u0107, the first president of an independent Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Resistance started and 14,000 Austro-Hungarian troops attacked on July 29, 1878, defeating all resistance in one day. Brick, tobacco, carpet, weaving, crafts, brewery, flour and sawmills were opened in the country over the next 30 years. The original trams were drawn by horses until 1895 when electricity arrived. Archduke Franc Ferdinand and his wife Sophia visited Sarajevo in 1914. Two assignment attempts were made on June 28, 1913. The first 2 bombs were thrown at their car unsuccessfully. Then both were shot dead by a single assassin. This event led to a chain of events that eventually triggered WW I. This tiny, one-room museum has some history and many personal artifacts. A touchscreen gives much-improved information along with several slide shows. 3 BAM<br \/>\n<strong>Bezistan Gazi Husrev-bey.<\/strong> A caravanserai named Taslihan was constructed next to this shopping mall in 1543 (vaults and domes made of lead, 2 floors the bottom for stables and storage and the top with 30 heated rooms for 90 guests), the victim of several fires, the last in 1879, it is now a ruin. The next year, this shopping mall was constructed next door. It is a lovely 200m long brick, barrel-vaulted corridor with 20 small barrel-vaulted shops on each side. It has an amazing number of handbag stores. The back opens up onto a long pedestrianized shopping street.<br \/>\n<strong>Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque.<\/strong> Surrounded by stone walls, this large mosque has a portico with 5 domes and a stone minaret. It is only open to tourists from 9-12 and 5:30-9. Across the lane is a museum on Gazi Husrev-beg, that appears to be built in an old madrassa. The mosque inside is very average and not worth the 3KM entrance fee (the front door is locked outside of prayer times but can be entered via a door just behind the minaret). There are some large stalactites in the front corners of the mosque.<br \/>\n<strong>Svrzo&#8217;s House <\/strong>(Svrzina House). Built in 1640 by the wealthy Glodar family, it is a typical Ottoman house of the 18<sup>th<\/sup> century (destroyed by fire in 1697 and reconstructed in the 18<sup>th<\/sup> century. It has two parts, a private haremluk for the family and a semanluk for the reception of male guests, service rooms and quarters for the domestic help. 10 BAM<br \/>\n<strong>War Childhood Museum<\/strong>. A book was written using Facebook research and 50 of the \u201cstories\u201d accompanied by personal objects are shown in lovely small vignettes. Six Syrian children also are included. A 30-minute video shows the personal stories of many who endured the war. 10 BAM<br \/>\n<strong>Jewish Museum<\/strong> (Muzej Jevreja). About 30 Jewish merchants arrived in Sarajevo in 1551, all Sephardic Jews originally from Spain and Portugal (who expelled all Jews between 1492 and 96. In 1070, there were 1,070 Jews in the city and all other Jewish communities in B&amp;H were founded by Sarajevo Jews. A fire destroyed the synagogue in 1697 and 1788, it was ransacked and demolished in 1941 and was used as a prison for Jews by the Nazis (restored in 1957) and damage from the Balkan war was repaired in 2003. Since 2001, Rosh Hashanah has been celebrated here. Jews were not treated as full citizens of the city having to pay special taxes until 1856 when laws changed to make them equal to Muslims.<br \/>\nThe museum is located in the former synagogue originally built in 1581. It is a lovely stone building with aisles on both sides and three domes. Two floors have been constructed to hold the museum exhibits chronicling Jewish contributions to the community along with several artifacts. 3 BAM<br \/>\n<strong>Museum of Crimes Against Humanity and Genocide<\/strong>. This tells the personal testimonials and major events in the Bosnian War of 1992-95 concentrating on torture, jailing, concentration camps, genocide, serial rape and all the horrific atrocities committed by the Serbs. There are many personal items very much like the War Childhood Museum. When mass graves were exhumed, often the only way to identify bodies was by the jewelry remaining on the bodies. 10 BAM<br \/>\n<strong>Gallery 11\/07\/1995.<\/strong> On the third floor of a building next to the cathedral, this museum primarily highlights the Srebrenica Genocide (a map of the genocide and a memorial film) when 8,000 men were murdered by Serbian militants over 3 days starting on July 11, 1995. The UN established a \u201csafe\u201d zone in Srebrenica in 1993 but didn\u2019t defend it and only facilitated a concentration of people that made an easy target. The Siege of Sarajevo is also chronicled. Other exhibits include a video by Bill Clinton, a missing person\u2019s wall, a portrait room and original posters created during the siege of Sarajevo. 12 BAM<br \/>\n<strong>Sacred Heart Cathedral.<\/strong> This lovely Roman Catholic church is painted inside into faux stone blocks in yellow and brown \u2013 on the walls, arches and columns.

Google Maps was of no help nor did it appear in a Google search. I asked at least 10 people where it might be. Few spoke English and nobody had ever heard of the place. An older man did not know the monument by name but remembered one with his arms raised in a park near the market.<br \/>\nIt\u2019s a great all-bronze monument: a large completely nude man is standing in a globe of bronze rods forming the meridians. Five doves are attached to the rods and the man has his arms raised clutching two of the rods. There were also 15 pigeons perched over it all. On the pedestal is written \u201cmulticultural man\u201d in French and Bosnian and the date July 14, 1997.<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/131752913@N03\/33216138862\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwiEvJCkkKLiAhUDLewKHQIjBeUQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/farm4.staticflickr.com\/3905\/33216138862_5f9e39fc63_b.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Multicultural Man\" width=\"398\" height=\"398\" data-iml=\"1558081066298\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Cathedral Church of the Nativity of the Theotokos.<\/strong> Built in 1868, this is the largest Orthodox church in the Balkans.

With a relatively intact wall, there is little to see in the castle itself but the views down to the town are great.<br \/>\n<strong>AVNOJ Museum.<\/strong> Jajce was liberated in August 1943 and became the headquarters of the resistance movement. In November 1943, the second session of the AVNOJ (Antifascist Council of the National Liberation of Yugoslavia) was held in this building (the first council was in November 1942 in Biha\u0107 and the Communist Party of Yugoslavia was formed in early 1943 with Tito as its head). Delegates from all over Yugoslavia (except Macedonia and Sndzt) attended the council. They laid the foundations for a democratic Yugoslavia (incongruously by a communist party, odd how they usually put \u2018democratic\u2019 in their name). The large hall has a huge number of photos and documents presenting facts in a disorganized, repetitive way. A bust of Tito sits at the front of the stage. In the basement is a gallery of art and posters.<br \/>\nThe country was liberated by November 1944 and the first cabinet of the Democratic Federation of Yugoslavia met on April 14, 1945. 4 BAM<\/p>\n<p><em>From Jajce, I drove northwest reentering the Republic of Srpska just outside of town reentering at <\/em>Sanski Most.

In the town of Sanski, approximately 5,500 Serb civilians and some 50 Jews were murdered by Usta\u0161e forces and Bosnian Muslim militias. In addition, there were mass rapes of women and girls instead.<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong>The victims were buried in mass graves, many of which are on the \u0160u\u0161njar Hill. Here is now the monument, which is highly neglected.<br \/>\nIn a treed park is this very unusual memorial with no signs explaining it. Enter a brick arch gate with a black slab in Cyrillic and a Star of David. The path is bordered by hundreds of concrete blocks with metal labels most dated from 1941-44 (they are all overgrown and mossy). Pass a large concrete slab with a cross to see the odd large geometric construction of riveted metal panels. Some of the panels have been removed exposing a small chamber inside littered with garbage. The structure is surrounded by huge, horizontal, hollow cement columns supported on pedestals. The whole place is very neglected but the grass had been mowed.<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"http:\/\/notsobasic.hosting.nyu.edu\/collection\/exhibits\/show\/pastandpresent\/item\/29\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwjLtcj0k6LiAhWEy6QKHYLABGUQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"http:\/\/notsobasic.hosting.nyu.edu\/collection\/files\/original\/139c7f64a2868c6d6b02354fdf21418a.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Sanski Most Memorial\" width=\"531\" height=\"398\" data-iml=\"1558082038974\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em>It was then a long drive northwest across mountains on the R405 to join the M14 and follow the Una River through a nice limestone canyon.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Ostro\u017eac Castle<\/strong>, Ostro\u017eac. This was a medieval fort built in 1296 by the princes of Babonji\u0107e of Blacj and conquered by the Ottomans led by Ferhad Pasha Soolovi\u0107 after 100 years of siege in 1571. It was controlled by the Besineivi\u0107 family who enlarged it and built the large keep on the west end. In 1846, it was purchased by Count Lothar von Berks, then mayor of Biha\u0107 who added a neo-Gothic castle in 1900-02. Lothar died in 1919 and the family lived in it until 1932 when they moved to Slavonia. The plaque stated that they still used it as a summer residence, but that must have been some years ago.<br \/>\nEnter the large, intact fortress and pass a sculpture garden in a lovely big area of grass. From 1967-2008, the fort was the location of a sculpture colony with attendees from all over the world. There are 130, mostly abstract sculptures, some quite interesting. The large mansion must have been quite nice but now is a neglected ruin. Most of the floors between the two stories have been removed. There are several lovely rooms at the south end and a balcony that looks down to the Una River far below. It is a 4.2km drive up from the M14 highway.
