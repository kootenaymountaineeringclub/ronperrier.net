Roasting marshmallows, exploring the Box Lake Loop, and playing at the lakeshore provide an easily accessed morning or afternoon of delightful adventure.<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Difficulty:<\/strong>\u00a0Easy A1\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Distance:<\/strong> 1.3km<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Time:<\/strong> \u00bd hours<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Drive:<\/strong> From Nakusp, head south on Highway 6, toward Nelson, for about 10 km. After passing Box Lake on the right, a brown wooden sign marks the Box Lake Forest Service Road, also on the right; follow this well-kept dirt road for 2.2 km until you switch back toward the lake to arrive at the Forest Service campsite. Walk, ride or drive to the last campsite, where the gentle Box Lake Loop trail begins.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Trail:<\/strong> Box Loop Trail provides a gentle walk through a second-growth cedar\/hemlock forest typical of most valleys in this area. The path winds from the Forest Service camping area for 500m through the mature, moist forest. Very little sunlight reaches the forest floor here, so the undergrowth is sparse. A thick carpet of step moss covers the ground, and patches of boxwood, mushrooms and Devil&#8217;s club are seen. Look for stumps from original logging many years ago and dead snags where birds and small animals have made their homes.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The trail winds near the marshy creek inlet, to the left of the trail. The marsh affords perfect riparian habitat for ducks, frogs, eagles, and larger mammals and can be observed best from the little spur leading off the trail to the left, about 200 metres along the main trail. After observing the lively marsh, hikers can return to the main trail and follow it to the Box Lake Forest Service Road. Turn right onto the road, which will continue the loop for 700 metres back to the campsite parking lot.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> For hikers or bikers looking for a longer trek, there is a rough road behind Box Lake connecting to Brouse Loop Road at its far end. The road is accessed by taking the spur road leading off of the sharp corner in the road leading into the campsite (GPS Point 4). This old road is a favourite of local bikers, opening up some great territory behind Box Lake. Be respectful; the road goes through private property.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Box Lake Loop is easy to travel on foot and easy to moderate on a bicycle. The extension behind Box Lake provides moderate biking.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Box Lake Loop provides excellent introductory hiking for children, as it not only holds the allure of interesting forest and marsh habitat but also a lake for swimming or tossing stones and campsites for a picnic.
