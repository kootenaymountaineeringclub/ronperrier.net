But the archipelago, about 500km off the coast of Africa, has something else going for it. It is one of the region\u2019s few fully fledged democracies.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Africa has more than its share of despots. But archipelagoes like Cape Verde seem to have avoided this curse. Four of Africa\u2019s five island-states with less than 1.5m inhabitants are rated \u201cfree\u201d by Freedom House, an American think-tank. This means they are largely liberal and democratic. For the continent as a whole, fewer than one in five countries is \u201cfree\u201d.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">A study published this month in the\u00a0<em>Journal of International Relations and Development<\/em>\u00a0argues that the size and insularity of these countries\u2014Cape Verde, the Comoros, Mauritius, S\u00e3o Tome and Principe and the Seychelles\u2014hold the key to their freedom. It is part of a growing body of academic research that suggests that being small and being an island are associated with democracy. In Africa, the authors of the study argue, smallness leads to a more personal politics, where constituents can pester officials to keep their promises. Being islands, the authors add, spares these countries from land borders which their neighbours may contest or over which conflicts can spill.<\/p>\n<div class=\"article__body-text-image\">\n<figure>\n<div data-slim=\"1\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/608\/723\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210626_MAM952.png\" sizes=\"300px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/200\/238\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210626_MAM952.png 200w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/300\/357\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210626_MAM952.png 300w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/400\/476\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210626_MAM952.png 400w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/600\/713\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210626_MAM952.png 600w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/640\/761\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210626_MAM952.png 640w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/800\/951\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210626_MAM952.png 800w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/1000\/1189\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210626_MAM952.png 1000w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/1280\/1522\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210626_MAM952.png 1280w\" alt=\"\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Take Cape Verde. After independence it was led by a single party. Though far from democratic, it still held regular elections and allowed some opposition politicians to compete. The authors attribute that relative liberalism to the island\u2019s personal politics. It is a lot harder, they say, for a single party to crack down on dissidents when they are neighbours and friends. In the 1990s it fully democratised, thanks in large part to the relative liberalism of the previous decades. Today Cape Verde sits just below Britain on Freedom House\u2019s democracy ranking.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Identifying the underpinnings of democracy is tricky, especially with such a tiny sample and given that small countries are more likely to be statistical outliers. These islands have a handful of other attributes that could explain their politics. They lack natural riches, such as diamonds and oil, which prop up despots in other places. Instead, many of the islands rely on tourism, which tends to provide jobs and income to a wide swathe of society, and so can foster stability and development. But the five are varied in other respects, having been colonised by different countries, bequeathed different political systems and attained different levels of development. The Seychelles has more than four times the\u00a0<small>gdp<\/small>\u00a0per person of Cape Verde or the Comoros. Mauritius has a parliamentary system inherited from Britain. The Seychelles and the Comoros are presidential. Cape Verde and S\u00e3o Tome and Principe have semi-presidential systems.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">The success of small islands is not instructive for the rest of Africa. Mainland countries cannot break up into tiny states and drift into the Atlantic. Even if they could, small island democracies have flaws. Cape Verdeans complain about graft, which, ironically, may stem from the same personal politics that allowed democracy to flourish. The Comoros struggles with political instability. The Seychelles had its first peaceful transition of power in decades only last year. What the study does illuminate, though, is the potential of African countries to be democratic and well-run, even if for now, most are not.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Islands of democracy Why Africa\u2019s island-states are generally freer Size is important; so is being an island Jun 26th 2021 ECONOMIST Cape verde\u00a0may be best known for white sand beaches.
