Ibiza provides an excellent example of the interaction between the marine and coastal ecosystems. The dense prairies of oceanic Posidonia (seagrass), an important endemic species found only in the Mediterranean basin, contain and support a diversity of marine life. Ibiza preserves considerable evidence of its long history. The Phoenician ruins at\u00a0<em>Sa Caleta<\/em>\u00a0(settlement) and\u00a0<em>Puig des Molins<\/em>\u00a0(necropolis) testify to the important role played by the island in the Mediterranean economy in protohistory, particularly during the Phoenician-Carthaginian period.<br \/>\nUpper Town of Ibiza is an excellent example of a fortified acropolis which preserves in an exceptional way in its walls and in its urban fabric successive imprints of the earliest Phoenicians settlements and the Arab and Catalan periods through to the Renaissance bastions. The long process of building the defensive walls has not destroyed the earlier phases or the street pattern, but has incorporated them in the ultimate phase. An outstanding example of 16th century military architecture; it had a profound influence on the development of fortifications in the Spanish settlements of the New World.<br \/>\n<strong>Ses Salines Beach\u00a0<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Aquarium Cap Blanc,<\/strong> Sant Antoni de Portmany.<br \/>\n<strong>IBIZA (town)\u00a0<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Museu d&#8217;Art Contemporani d&#8217;Eivissa<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Museu Puget<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">MAJORCA<\/span><br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>CULTURAL LANDSCAPE of the SERRA de TRAMUNTANA<\/strong>.\u00a0World Heritage Site. Located on a sheer-sided mountain range parallel to the north-western coast of the island of Mallorca. Millennia of agriculture in an environment with scarce resources has transformed the terrain and displays an articulated network of devices for the management of water revolving around farming units of feudal origins. The landscape is marked by agricultural terraces and inter-connected water works &#8211; including water mills &#8211; as well as dry stone constructions and farms.<br \/>\nTransformations of the steep terrain to exploit the scarce available resources using a system of terraces and cobbled road network with an articulated network of devices for the management of water, revolving around farming units of feudal origins. Several villages, churches, sanctuaries, towers, lighthouses and small dry-stone structures punctuate the terraced landscape and contribute to its actual character.<br \/>\nExemplifies the interchange between the Muslim and Christian cultures, Arabic water harvesting and management technology introduced by the Christian conquerors, who took over the island of Mallorca in 13th century AD &#8211; orchards, vegetable gardens and olive groves, which were earlier organised around small farm holdings, and later in large estates (posesiones) and which nowadays make up the physical and functional features of the Serra de Tramuntana.<br \/>\nHighly specialised system of waterworks for collecting and storing water, featuring qanats, that are underground channels to harvest and transport water, canals, ditches, storage basins, with a system of terraces supported by dry-stone walls and including a sophisticated drainage system to avoid soil erosion.<br \/>\nTheir land distribution and use pattern, comprising rocky areas on the tops of mountains, strips of woodland, slopes with terraces, extensive grazing land, fields for reaping, vineyards or fruit crops on flatter land, ensured over time the full exploitation of the existing resources. The Tramuntana area thus pays testimony to the continuous evolution of human settlement in a rugged and steep area of the island.<br \/>\n<strong>Fornalutx.<\/strong> Village<br \/>\n<strong>Platja de Formentor Beach\u00a0<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Playa de Muro beach\u00a0<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Frederic Chopin &amp; George Sand Museum.<\/strong> Valldemossa<br \/>\n<strong>Mol\u00ed d&#8217;Algaida,\u00a0<\/strong>Algaida.\u00a0windmill.<br \/>\n<strong>Sineu Windmill<\/strong><strong><em><br \/>\n<\/em>Cova des Pas de Vallgornera.\u00a0<\/strong>Cave<br \/>\n<strong>Cuevas del Drach.\u00a0<\/strong>Cave<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nPALMA. <\/strong>The capital of the Balearic Islands, offers its visitors not only sunshine, numerous bars, restaurants and shops but also a beautiful harbour and a historical centre.<br \/>\nPalma Airport (PMI)<strong><em><br \/>\n<\/em>Es Baluard.<\/strong> Museum<br \/>\n<strong>Fundaci\u00f3 Pilar I Joan Miro.<\/strong> Art Museum<br \/>\n<strong>Museu de Mallorca.<\/strong> Museum<strong><em><br \/>\n<\/em>Castell de Bellver.<\/strong> Castle<br \/>\n<strong>La Almudena.<\/strong> Castle<br \/>\n<strong>Palma de Mallorca Cathedral<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Auditorium de Palma de Mallorca<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Palma Aquarium<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Porto P\u00ed Lighthouse<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nSOLLER*<br \/>\nSoller tramway line<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Can Prunera Museum of Modernism<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>S\u00f3ller Botanical Garden<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">MENORCA<br \/>\n<\/span><\/strong>Mah\u00f3n\/Menorca Airport (MAH)<br \/>\n<strong>Museo de Menorca,<\/strong>\u00a0Mah\u00f3n<br \/>\n<strong>Cala Mitjana beach<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Es Grau beach<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Cap d\u2019Artrutx Lighthouse<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Mining Historical Heritage.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/strong>Tentative WHS:\u00a0\u00a0(27\/04\/2007).\u00a0The Mining Historical Heritage is a serial proposal consisting of 21 locations in nine provinces and regions spread over the entire country. The majority of the mining sites are coal and iron ore mines, but metals such as copper, silver, lead, gold and mercury were also mined. Among the selected sites are also stone quarries and salt works. In the oldest of these sites, mining activity dates back to the Neolithic period.<br \/>\n<em>Balearic Islands.<\/em>\u00a0Mares de S&#8217;Hostal Quarries (39&#8243; 59&#8242; N 1 3&#8242; 51&#8242; W) (MENORCA). Marine sands consolidated during the quaternary are of varying hardness and of a white to golden ochre colour. Quarries excavated stone for use in all types of construction from the earliest settlers in the Talayotic Period to the present.<br \/>\nExtraction is in the form of blocks which are subsequently broken into smaller pieces for different applications in construction. Traditional quarrying was by by the use of hand tools which left unique marks on the quarry wall. Mechanisation of the work resulted in a flat quarry face with deep cuts.<strong><br \/>\nTalayotic Culture of Minorca.<\/strong> Tentative WHS\u00a0 (29\/01\/2013). 25 archaeological sites that represent the Prehistory and Protohis\u00adtory of Minorca. They embrace the arrival of man on the island to the Medieval Islamic era. &#8220;Talayotic&#8221; refers to buil\u00addings in the form of a tower. The best talayotic cyclopean architecture is seen at Torre d&#8217;en Galmes (19), Talatf de Dalt (16), Cornia Nou (14), Monteff (21) and Trepuc6 (1B).<br \/>\nThe geological composition of Minorca is different to that of its neighbours in the Balearic archipelago.\u00a0The north of the island has older components that belong to the Primary and Secondary eras, that is, the Paleozic, the Triassic, the Jurassic and the Creta\u00adceous periods. It is characterized by an undulating relief with small mounds and valleys of reddish and ochre soil. The south, Terciary, is an extensive calca\u00adreous platform of the Miocene period, with a flat relief and good quality soil where forage is cultivated. This platform is criss-crossed by gullies, between which walls circulate spring water. In these places one finds orchards and kitchen gardens where a variety of fruit and vegetables are grown.<br \/>\nLarge blocks of stone were used in the island&#8217;s prehistoric constructions. Country houses and buildings were designed for raising cattle and sheep livestock. Thousands of kilometers of dry-stone walls form a grid.<br \/>\n1.Tomb of Ses Roques Llises and the enclosure of Sa Comerma de se Garita.
