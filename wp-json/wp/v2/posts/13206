At Midway, it connected to the CPR&#8217;s Columbia &amp; Western Railway, leading to Grand Forks and Castlegar.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Kettle Valley Rail Trail is a 480km section of decommissioned train tracks converted to a multi-use recreational trail (650km including the Columbia &amp; Western to Castlegar). The KVR extends from Midway in the east to Rock Creek, then north to Myra Canyon, down to Penticton, over to Princeton, Coalmont, Brookmere, Coquihalla and finally Hope, where it connects to the main CPR line. With a maximum 2.2% grade, the trail can be cycled or hiked by most with just a little preparation.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The KVRail Trail forms most of The Great Trail (Trans Canada Trail) in British Columbia.

Fourteen years later, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) arrived in BC \u2013 a little later than planned.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But unfortunately, the CPR didn\u2019t have a track that served the people of Southern BC.\u00a0 Mineral deposits like silver were being discovered, and a fruit industry was blossoming &#8211; they would become world-renowned if only they could get to the coast.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When the CPR completed the transcontinental railroad in 1885, the route cut through the Rocky Mountains at Kicking Horse and Rogers Passes, then followed the Fraser River for the remainder of the distance to Vancouver. This route was significantly to the north of the mining towns within the Southern Interior.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Those critical of the CPR believed that the railroad should have been routed along the Dewdney Trail, through the southern portions of British Columbia, to fulfill politicians&#8217; pledges to keep Americans out of British Columbia should they ever attempt to dominate mining operations in British Columbia&#8217;s south. However, geography was the main reason the CPR followed the transcontinental railroad route that it had selected. Too many mountain ranges stood between Alberta and Vancouver in the southern portions of British Columbia, and CPR had selected what they felt was the path of least resistance.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But this was a long trip to the coast or points east for people living in the South Okanagan, and the demand came about for a \u201cCoast-to-Kootenay\u201d connection. The Kettle Valley Railway was built out of necessity to service the growing mining and agricultural needs in the Southern Interior region of British Columbia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Minerals in the Kootenays.<\/strong> Once silver was discovered within the Kootenays in the spring of 1887, thousands of Americans flooded into British Columbia&#8217;s Southern Interior and essentially took control of the region. These miners quickly found that it was much quicker and cheaper to get their supplies from the recently completed Northern Pacific Railroad that transited through Spokane. Once word caught on, British Columbia&#8217;s Southern Interior essentially became a commercial annex of the United States. Provincial and Federal officials quickly agreed that a second railroad dubbed the &#8220;Coast-to-Kootenay&#8221; railroad within British Columbia was required to preserve Canadian sovereignty of British Columbia and to retain the valuable mining revenues within Canada.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Great Northern Railroad<\/strong>. Although the CPR was laying rails in other parts of BC, it was an American railroader, J.J. Hill, who was making headway in the southern part of the province. He was trying to bring a rail line up from Spokane through Oroville. Eventually, this was accomplished with the acquisition of the Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Railway, a subsidiary of the Great Northern Railroad. It arrived in Keremeos in 1907, and in Hedley and Princeton two years later.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The CPR had built the Columbia &amp; Western Railway through the Crow\u2019s Nest Pass to Midway. They had also put down track for the Nicola, Kamloops and Similkameen Railway. In 1901, the idea of the Kettle Valley Railway to connect Midway with the CPR main line arose. \u00a0The KRVR was a subsidiary corporation of the CPR.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Construction of the KVR &#8220;<em>Coast to Kootenay&#8221;<\/em>\u00a0railway.<\/strong> Building this &#8220;Coast-to-Kootenay&#8221; railroad was not an easy task, as three mountain ranges stood in the way. Construction was some of the costliest per track mile when compared to most other North American railroad projects, costing almost $20 million, and it took nearly 20 years to complete.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Construction of the railroad was not undertaken all at once, or even by one single company. The KVR was built between 1910 and 1916 under the direction of Andrew McCulloch, Chief Engineer for the CPR in the southern interior of British Columbia. He was hired to construct the Coast-to-Kootenay connection when the fear of leaving BC\u2019s mineral wealth vulnerable to exploitation by our neighbours reached its peak. The result was the building of 325 miles (500 kilometres) of rail over and through three mountain ranges. Like all railway construction of that era, the work was backbreaking, brutal and dangerous, and thousands of workers, most of them immigrants recruited to come to Canada specifically for this work, toiled in harsh conditions for years to complete this monumental task. More than a few lost their lives in the effort.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><em>Carmi Subdivision<\/em>\u00a0<\/strong>(Midway to Penticton). Survey work began in 1910 from Midway, Rock Creek, then north to Beaverdell and Mara Canyon before turning south to terminate in Penticton.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><em>Princeton Subdivision<\/em><\/strong> (Penticton to Princeton). After Penticton and Summerland, the route went up to Osprey Lake to the grasslands of Jura, all on the CPR track.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><em><strong>Coquihalla Subdivision\u00a0<\/strong><\/em>(Princeton to Hope). Work began on the line through the Coquihalla Pass a year later. This core portion of the KVR started in Hope up the steep Coquihalla Valley through the narrow rocky canyon to Coquihalla Pass using the Othello-Quintette Tunnels. When constructing the railway through the roughest portion of the Coquihalla Canyon, Chief Engineer Andrew McCulloch determined that the proposed routing was unnecessarily long and complex. He decided that a straight section of track with five closely aligned tunnels and two bridges was needed. The Coquihalla subdivision then transitioned through GN track via Brookmere and Tulameen to Princeton.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The earlier trains on the KVR were routed from Spence\u2019s Bridge to connect with the CPR mainline. After July of 1916, the Coquihalla subdivision was complete, and the trains travelled south from Brodie to Hope, meeting up with the CPR mainline there.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">In time, the Coquihalla subdivision proved too much to handle, suffering many washouts, snow, and rock slides, so in 1959, after a series of abandonments, it was closed, and the earlier route was adopted once more.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><em>Branch Lines<\/em>.<\/strong> At the end of WWI, spur lines connected the mines of Copper Mountain with Princeton, Oliver with Penticton and in 1944, Oliver with Osoyoos. No part of the Boundary Subdivision (Nelson-Midway) was ever part of official KV territory.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The CPR had decided to construct these rail lines to tap new sources of revenue. Freight continued to run from Okanagan Falls to Spence\u2019s Bridge until 1989.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>KVR functions.<\/strong> Rail service on the KVR consisted of both passenger and freight trains. Passenger service over the line consisted for many years of the\u00a0<em>Kettle Valley Express<\/em>\u00a0and the\u00a0<em>Kootenay Express<\/em>, which carried passengers between Vancouver, BC and Medicine Hat, Alberta. Freight was primarily ore from the Kootenay region, forestry products, and fruit from the Okanagan.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">During the Kettle Valley Railway&#8217;s lifespan, on numerous occasions, it was called upon to act as &#8220;The Second Mainline&#8221; when washouts, avalanches and rock slides closed off the main CPR line through the Fraser Canyon. CPR recognized the benefit of having a second railway transiting through British Columbia, so beginning in the late 1930s and up until 1959, they set off on an upgrade program that saw the weight-bearing strength of the rails increased, as well as bridge and trestle improvements, which brought the railway closer to mainline standards.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>The Demise of the KVR<\/strong><em><strong>.<\/strong><\/em> The KVR experienced the challenges all railways faced as transportation progressed: more and better roads, air travel and the challenges of operating a railway in rugged terrain and weather took their toll. The first portion to be abandoned was the Copper Mountain Branch in 1957 after the Copper Mountain Mine closed. The Coquihalla subdivision closed in 1959 after a large washout despite many recent upgrades, including several new bridges. Freight was discontinued throughout the line in 1961, and the former KVR line essentially became a wandering, low-trafficked branch line. \u2013 By 1964, passenger service had ceased. All rail service stopped from Midway to Penticton (including the famed Myra Canyon section) in May 1973, and rails along this section were removed in 1979-1980.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In 1977, the CP abandoned Okanagan Falls to Osoyoos due to the loss of fruit traffic to trucks, and no trains went past West Midway.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The remainder of the former KVR was doing quite well with forest products. In early 1983, wood chip service was moved to trucking and freight service finally ended in March 1989.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>ATTRACTIONS\u00a0<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Trout Creek Trestle Bridge<\/strong> in Summerland is one of the many KVR engineering achievements designed by Andrew McCulloch. It stretched 619 feet across and 238 feet above the Canyon floor. It was and is known as the \u201cinfinitesimal\u201d bridge \u2013 \u201cincalculable, inestimable, great and fathomless\u201d. It was the highest structure of its kind on the KVR and the third largest of its kind in North America at the time of its construction. The Trout Creek Bridge was upgraded in 1927 &amp; 1928 by filling in the Trestle approaches and replacing the trestle work with steel girders.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Othello-Quintette Tunnels. <\/strong>When constructing the railway through the roughest portion of the Coquihalla Canyon, Chief Engineer Andrew McCulloch determined that the proposed routing was unnecessarily long and complex. He decided that a straight section of track with five closely aligned tunnels and two bridges needed to be built between three of the tunnels. They are a popular tourist attraction and are located along the existing Coquihalla Highway (however, they are not visible from the highway). These tunnels are also known as the Othello Tunnels because they are near the Othello Railway station, named for the Shakespeare character, as is the case with other stations on this stretch of the railway: Iago, Romeo, Juliet, Lear, Jessica, and Portia. Shylock was never an official KVR station name. A spur just below Portia was unofficially known as &#8216;Shylock Spur.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Myra Canyon, south of Kelowna on Okanagan Mountain,<\/strong> is the most popular section of the former KVR. In the section of line between\u00a0Midway\u00a0and\u00a0Penticton, this section of railway between Myra station and June Springs station required 18 wooden trestles and two tunnels to traverse the deep canyon.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">With a relatively gentle grade, it is very popular with hikers and cyclists. Years of disrepair on the trestles began to take their toll; railway ties had been removed, creating significant gaps on trestles and bridges hundreds of feet in height. After a fatal accident involving a cyclist on one of the trestles, repairs included handrails and planks. This section of the railway was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2002.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">From August to September 2003, lightning caused the 2003 Okanagan Mountain Park Fire to engulf many portions of the KVR between Penticton and McCulloch Lake. The fire claimed 12 of the 18 trestles within Myra Canyon and the bridge decks of two of the metal bridges. The B.C provincial government rebuilt the damaged and destroyed trestles and bridges and stabilized rock faces.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Kettle Valley Steam Railway<\/strong> is an operating heritage railway along a preserved 10-kilometre section from Prairie Valley Station to Canyon View Siding, near Summerland, British Columbia. This is the only active remaining section of the Kettle Valley Railway. Eventually, a permanent station was built at the Prairie Valley station, providing an excellent access point for the railway.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It initially operated with one 1924 Shay locomotive loaned from the BC Forest Discovery Centre. The rolling stock is originally Canadian Pacific, used on the Royal Hudson. The most recent locomotive addition to the Kettle Valley Steam Railway is a Canadian Pacific Montreal Locomotive Works 2-8-0. The train now travels to the middle of the Trout Creek Bridge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>PREPARATIONS<br \/>\n<\/strong>The KVR is, in large parts, an ATV trail, with deep dirt and sand sections throughout. Our recommendation, if you were to pursue this trip as a multi-day trip, is to use mountain bikes with at least 2.0\u2033 of tire width. The KVR is a multi-use trail. The KVR Trail Society had been trying to keep it maintained enough for cyclists to use, as ATVs can be very destructive to trail surfaces.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Information:<\/strong> Cycling The Kettle Valley Railway by Dan and Sandra Langford.

The trail descends to Penticton with some sandy sections, especially later in summer. A series of long switchbacks is often fairly busy with hikers who want to see the massive rock ovens left behind by railway workers. The Adra tunnel is blocked due to unsafe conditions; the tunnel doubles back on itself as it climbs, making the interior completely dark. Then there is the little tunnel that overlooks Okanagan Lake and Penticton. The view is fantastic from there.

Ice used to be harvested from Otter Lake. Then pass through Manning, Thalia and Spearing before you come to Brookmere.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Brookmere.<\/strong> The water tower has been moved. It has interesting water spouts on both sides of the tower, as the Kettle Valley Railway runs on one side and the Grand Northern Railway on the other. They shared the rails south of Brookmere right to Princeton. At Princeton, the GNR continued to Hedley, then crossed the Similkameen just before Hedley and headed south to the US. This is the railway that J.J. Hill built.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">On the second weekend in August, many retired (and active) railroaders meet there to discuss old times and the old KVR. The station here is long gone, but the section house remains and, for a long time, was a museum with lots of railway memorabilia. Many of the houses in Brookmere are originals from the time of the Kettle Valley Railway. At one time, Brookmere boasted a school and a hotel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>C. COQUIHALLA SUBDIVISION &#8211; Brodie Wye to Hope\u00a0<\/strong>\u00a084.7kms<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Lowest elevation: 5m in Hope; Highest Elevation: 1104m at Coquihalla Station.<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong>If you are thinking of riding Highway #3 through Manning Park to Hope, I would reconsider. Seems like it would be easier, but the highway is all hills after Princeton, and some passes proved to be a considerable challenge.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">This section of track ran from Hope to the Brodie Wye, located approximately 35 kilometres west of Merritt in the Coldwater Valley. At its southernmost tip, it connected to the Canadian Pacific mainline at what was called Odlum. The tracks reached the CPR mainline via a unique bridge that still stands today; the rails were actually run under what is the current highway bridge. The tracks were removed in 1962.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">After Hope, the tracks followed the\u00a0Coquihalla\u00a0River to the\u00a0Othello Tunnels\u00a0or Quintette Tunnels. Very little of the original right of way is visible except for a large section preserved in the Othello Tunnels Provincial Park.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">From the Othello Tunnels, the right of way used to go to Lear, Jessica, Aurum, Shylock, Portia, Iago, Romeo, Coquihalla, Juliet and finally Brodie Wye. Coquihalla Station is not the highest section of the railway, as one would expect. The KVR right of way now takes a different route at the Portia station and goes into a valley that comes out at the Coquihalla Lakes. In this section, the grade exceeded 2.2% in some sections.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">This section was the most challenging section of the Kettle Valley Railway to keep open due to washouts, landslides, forest fires and the immense amount of snowfall each winter. This section was the first section of the railway to be abandoned, with trains being rerouted via Spences Bridge to Merritt.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Most of the right of way in this section, including buildings, have been destroyed long ago. A few pockets stand out, such as Jessica, which was a small private community. All of the tunnels in this section have been caved in for public safety. There are a few steel bridges to be found here and there. Most of the right-of-way has been paved over by the Coquihalla Highway.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Another notable landmark in this section is the steel trestle at <strong>Ladner Creek; it is one of the highest<\/strong> trestles still standing. There was a wooden trestle at one time below the Falls Lake exit; it was the tallest and most spectacular wooden trestle on the entire line. It succumbed to the elements and fell in the late 90s.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>KETTLE VALLEY RAILWAY Kettle Valley Railway (KVR) was a subsidiary of the Canadian Pacific Railway that operated in southern British Columbia between Midway and Hope.
