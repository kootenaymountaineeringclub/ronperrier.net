One of those annoying people who had settled on a career before I knew how to drive, I was a young and enthusiastic reporter on the education beat. In New York, I could cover the biggest education revolution ever attempted: a total overhaul of the way public schools worked, in the country\u2019s largest school system.<\/p>\n<div class=\"c-ad c-ad--house ad-housepromo-d-wrapper\" data-template=\"hippo\/components\/ads\/article-house-desktop.html\" data-pos=\"housepromo-d\">\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_\/4624\/TheAtlanticOnline\/channel_education\/article2.0.0_0__container__\">\n<section class=\"ha-c-mag-promo\">\n<div class=\"ha-c-mag-promo__container\">\n<div class=\"ha-c-mag-promo__subscribe\">\n<div class=\"ha-c-mag-promo__text\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>The drivers of this transformation were the city\u2019s billionaire mayor, Michael Bloomberg, and his handpicked schools chancellor, Joel Klein, a prosecutor who had previously taken on Microsoft and had now set his sights on toppling his hometown\u2019s education status quo. \u201cBloomKlein,\u201d as their enemies called them, radiated a crusading moral confidence. Both liked to say that their work, begun in 2003, was the next phase of the civil-rights movement. And they wielded unprecedented authority to actually follow through on their enlightened mission to tackle inequities and eradicate dysfunction; in 2002, state lawmakers had dissolved New York City\u2019s elected school board and handed total control to the mayor. Supporters and opponents alike shared the BloomKlein conviction that their \u201cdisruptions\u201d would soon spread to cities all across the country.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<aside class=\"l-rail l-rail--right l-rail--1\" role=\"complementary\">\n<div class=\"c-ad s-native s-native--standard s-native--small c-ad--unlabeled ad-boxrr-wrapper\" data-section=\"side\" data-template=\"hippo\/components\/ads\/rail.html\" data-pos=\"boxrr\">\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_\/4624\/TheAtlanticOnline\/channel_education\/article2.0.0_2__container__\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">A decade later, I can say that I did indeed land in New York City just as a sweeping remake of public education got under way not only for New Yorkers but for families all across America. Except I got the architects of the transformation wrong. Bloomberg and Klein played their part, but the real revolutionary was another person I met early on in my reporting: a 5-foot-2-inch redhead from Harlem named Eva Moskowitz.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"blah\">\n<div class=\"l-article__container__container\">\n<section id=\"article-section-1\" class=\"l-article__section s-cms-content\">\n<p class=\"dropcap\"><span class=\"smallcaps\">It was june 2007,<\/span> and I was following the mayor around as he took a victory lap celebrating record-high test scores. \u201cWho\u2019s excited about summer?,\u201d Bloomberg asked a group of 5-, 6-, and 7-year-olds seated in front of him at their new Harlem elementary school, which had opened the previous August. He ticked off the fun things they might do once school let out, like go to the pool. The school\u2019s principal, Eva Moskowitz, spoke next. She didn\u2019t \u201cwant to contradict the mayor,\u201d she said solemnly, \u201cbut there\u2019s going to be some swimming, but there\u2019s also going to be some <i>reading<\/i>.\u201d Later, the mom of a kindergartner told me just how serious the principal was. To keep up with the school\u2019s reading requirements, she and her son regularly hauled 50 books home from the library. What were <i>you<\/i> doing in kindergarten?<\/p>\n<p>I had visited impressive schools before, but none quite like this one. The kids, who congregated in a corner of a large public-school building on West 118th Street, were a sight with their orange-and-blue uniforms and blue backpacks. But the person who made the biggest impression was Moskowitz herself. She stalked the school corridors more like a rear admiral than a pedagogue, rattling off to whomever would listen the obstacles she was up against: union rules governing sink repair, school bells ringing on a cryptic schedule, doors requiring custom fixes. She was either paranoid or plagued, probably some of both. Feeling under siege, she could either defend or attack. She picked the Napoleon option.<\/p>\n<p>Like other charter schools\u2014which operate independently of a school district\u2019s control but are still publicly regulated and funded\u2014Harlem Success Academy, as the school had been named, was starting up slowly, serving 165 kindergartners and first-graders in its inaugural year. But already Moskowitz had set herself apart. While other charter-school leaders ran only a handful of schools in a given state, she planned to open 40 more schools like this one. All in New York City, and all in a single decade.<\/p>\n<div class=\"c-ad c-ad--full-width s-native s-native--standard s-native--small ad-boxinjector-flex-m-wrapper\" data-template=\"hippo\/components\/ads\/article-mobile.html\" data-native=\"True\" data-pos=\"boxinjector-flex-m\"><\/div>\n<p>I underlined the number in my reporter\u2019s notebook. By some measures, 40 wasn\u2019t unprecedented. The country\u2019s best-known charter network,<span class=\"smallcaps\">kipp<\/span>, had grown to 46 schools by 2006. It was part of an expansion funded by the founders of the Gap, Doris and Don Fisher, after the charter movement took off in the 1990s. But <span class=\"smallcaps\">kipp<\/span> schools were spread across 15 states, with just a few schools per city. New York City had four. Like the Gap, which had made its name targeting young people, the point was to serve not an entire market, but a niche\u2014in <span class=\"smallcaps\">kipp<\/span>\u2019s case, the poorest students.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"blah\">\n<div class=\"l-article__container__container\">\n<section id=\"article-section-2\" class=\"l-article__section s-cms-content\"><span class=\"smallcaps\">kipp<\/span> and other charter-school operators had a pragmatic take on how big school networks could or should get. As of 2006, laws in 25 states and Washington, D.C., limited the number of new charters that could open; 10 states did not have charters at all. And while the idea was to improve on traditional public schools, the first comprehensive report on outcomes revealed that many charter schools performed no better, and sometimes worse, than comparable district schools. Serving just 1 percent of all New York City students and about 2.5 percent of students nationwide, charter schools were, at best, \u201ca proof point,\u201d as one<span class=\"smallcaps\"> kipp<\/span> board member put it: not a new model to follow, but experiments to inspire, and goad, the government-run public-school system.<\/p>\n<p>Forty Success Academy schools in a single city in a decade, on the other hand\u2014that was two-thirds the number of charter schools in all of New York City at that point. What Moskowitz had in mind was not a proof point but a blueprint, not a Gap but a kind of educational superstore. A whole new school system, run by her instead of the government. \u201cHopefully this will be the first prototype,\u201d the chair of Harlem Success Academy\u2019s board told me that day in 2007. \u201cThis is meant to be replicable.\u201d I tried to picture 15,000 students across New York City, all carrying matching blue backpacks. Moskowitz couldn\u2019t have stunned me more had she said that she intended to one day run for mayor (a goal she announced a few months later). Her charter plan was audacious, but it probably wouldn\u2019t happen.<\/p>\n<p class=\"dropcap\"><span class=\"smallcaps\">It happened<\/span>, and then some. One school became 46. One hundred sixty-five students became 15,500. A tiny outpost in Harlem spawned brethren all across Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens; Harlem Success Academy is now part of the Success Academy Charter Schools network, of which Moskowitz\u2014the author of a lively new memoir, <i>The Education of Eva Moskowitz<\/i>\u2014is CEO. From that position, she has become one of the country\u2019s most influential crusaders at a turning point for charter schooling.<\/p>\n<div class=\"c-ad c-ad--full-width s-native s-native--standard s-native--small ad-boxinjector-m-wrapper\" data-template=\"hippo\/components\/ads\/article-mobile.html\" data-pos=\"boxinjector-m\"><\/div>\n<p>Empire has not killed quality. On the contrary, students at Success\u2014where intensive test prep in math and reading goes hand in hand with a strong emphasis on science, art, and chess\u2014regularly trounce their peers all across New York on state tests. Unlike other high-scoring charter schools, such as <span class=\"smallcaps\">kipp<\/span>, Success saw no dip in performance after the state adopted the tougher Common Core academic standards. The stellar scores helped Moskowitz open more schools, faster, than any other charter-school leader in New York.<\/p>\n<p>In her march forward, Moskowitz has added considerably to the ranks of her foes. Teachers who oppose charter schools carry signs denouncing <span class=\"smallcaps\">evil moskowitz<\/span>. In 2013, Mayor Bill de Blasio campaigned on an education platform of ending Moskowitz\u2019s \u201crun of the place.\u201d Even many supporters hold Moskowitz at what can generously be called a careful distance, and I get it. Her acid tirades are legendary and can get scathingly personal more quickly than I might have believed had she not once dressed me down after I wrote a story she didn\u2019t like.<picture><\/picture>\n<p><i>The Education of Eva Moskowitz<\/i> is plainly positioned to soften and humanize, yet even here, she often swerves into score-settling eviscerations of her perceived enemies. She devotes two chapters to decrying the media, in particular a <i>New York Times<\/i> reporter\u2019s coverage of Success\u2019s disciplinary practices; Moskowitz accuses her of a biased \u201cabuse\u201d of journalistic privilege. <i>Lazy<\/i>, meanwhile, is a tag she affixes to students and bureaucrats alike. She has no patience for critics who question Success\u2019s high-stress test prep (as some of her own teachers do). Nor can she resist deriding fellow charter-school leaders as \u201cpolitical pacifists.&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"blah\">\n<div class=\"l-article__container__container\">\n<section id=\"article-section-3\" class=\"l-article__section s-cms-content\">Personally, I draw the line at <i>evil<\/i>, but Moskowitz is undeniably scary. Cross her, and you\u2019ve also crossed her students, her schools, and justice itself. Entrusting a person who has such an exceptional capacity for venom with the care of children can seem unwise. Which is just one reason I am more than a little terrified by the conclusion I\u2019ve reached: Moskowitz has created the most impressive education system I\u2019ve ever seen. And as she announces in her memoir, 46 schools is just the beginning. \u201cWe need to reach more students,\u201d she writes.<\/p>\n<p>How big should Success get? She doesn\u2019t specify, but says that \u201cmaybe a public school system consisting principally of charter schools would be an improvement.\u201d A proud product of public schools herself, Moskowitz did not reach this conclusion lightly. Imagining the end of public education as we know it\u2014or at least its significant diminution\u2014at first felt \u201calmost disloyal,\u201d she writes. But that was before she lost faith in schools run by the government. In her memoir she describes how she finally decided against a mayoral run\u2014swayed not by a lack of ambition but by a surplus of it. The point is worth pausing over: Moskowitz has realized that she can do more to change public schools as a private citizen than as mayor\u2014by operating outside of democracy rather than within it. I agree with her, and that unsettles me.<\/p>\n<p class=\"dropcap\"><span class=\"smallcaps\">Moskowitz came by <\/span>her disillusion firsthand. In 1999, then in her 30s, she ran for New York\u2019s city council, spurred in part by a desire to improve the city\u2019s schools. She\u2019d lived through hapless management (in high school, she never used the bathroom, because the stalls had no doors) and wildly uneven teaching quality (one teacher at her high school slept through class drunk, she reports). She won the race and, investigating what held back the schools, found a chief culprit: constrictive union contracts fortified by labor\u2019s monopoly over local politics. She set out to use her city-council seat to publicize the unions\u2019 power and create living proof of an elected official who flouted the unions and lived to tell the tale.<\/p>\n<p>In a dramatic series of hearings she held in 2003, one set of witnesses described the rules governing how school custodians were paid\u2014not according to how well they maintained the building, but according to how little of the school\u2019s custodial budget they spent doing so. Leftover funds became bonuses, arguably disincentivizing the provision of, say, doors on bathroom stalls. \u201cAs political theater, it doesn\u2019t get much more dramatic than this,\u201d the <i>New York Observer<\/i> wrote.<\/p>\n<p>As actual politics, Moskowitz\u2019s attempt to prove that a politician could survive taking on organized labor backfired. In 2005, she lost a close race for the next rung of office, Manhattan borough president. In the months that followed, Joel Klein approached elected officials for support of his reforms, which had also earned the ire of the teachers\u2019 union. Over and over, he received the same rueful rebuff: \u201cI agree with you, but I ain\u2019t gonna get Eva\u2019d.\u201d When the time came to negotiate a new contract with the teachers, just before Bloomberg\u2019s 2005 reelection campaign, even the mayor\u2014seemingly protected from politics as usual by his personal fortune\u2014succumbed to union pressure, according to Moskowitz and others. Klein ended up having to accept a contract he didn\u2019t like. By then, plans for Moskowitz\u2019s first charter school were under way. She was ready to test the viability of working outside the government.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"blah\">\n<div class=\"l-article__container__container\">\n<section id=\"article-section-4\" class=\"l-article__section s-cms-content\">I became disillusioned with the status quo too\u2014but later, and with more trepidation. At the news organization I co-founded in 2008, now called <i>Chalkbeat<\/i>, reporters began covering reformers whose aggressive plans to close district schools and replace them with charters seemed to inflame the very parents whom the reformers said they aimed to serve. And the district-hating almost always came with a thuggish brand of teacher-bashing. I knew bad teachers existed, and I knew many of them were unfairly protected. But the idea that merely pruning the bad apples would save schools was unsupported by evidence or reason. Fire the rotten 10 percent, and who exactly did these reformers think would fill out a 3.8-million-person workforce? Vilifying teachers and their unions was surely counterproductive because it alienated the same overloaded foot soldiers who would ultimately be responsible for turning around poor-performing schools.<\/p>\n<p>I also knew that we Americans have good reasons for subjecting our public schools to the direction of elected government. We like democracy, especially when it gives us a say in what and how our children are taught. Unwieldy though school districts may be when they\u2019re run by a school board or a mayor\u2014and guided by the dictates of governors, state lawmakers, Congress, and the president\u2014they give citizens a chance to weigh in. They are without a doubt <i>public<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>And yet, as I began work in 2010 on a book about teaching, I started to see why blowing up school districts might not be as crazy an idea as I initially thought. What struck me most is how impossible teaching is, especially in traditional public schools. While those who pursue the profession in other countries are provided with the infrastructure crucial to educating kids effectively\u2014a clear sense of what students need to learn, the basic materials necessary to help them learn it (such as a curriculum), and a decent training system\u2014teachers in the U.S. are left stranded.<\/p>\n<p>The reason isn\u2019t terrible union contracts or awful management decisions. The fault, I came to see, lies in the (often competing) edicts issued by municipal, state, and federal authorities, which add up to chaos for the teachers who actually have to implement them. It\u2019s not uncommon for a teacher to start the year focused on one goal\u2014say, improving students\u2019 writing\u2014only to be told mid-year that writing is no longer a priority, as happened just the other day at a Boston school I know of. We could hardly have designed a worse system for supporting good teaching had we tried.<\/p>\n<p>Of all the reforms that have set out to free schools from this trap, to date I\u2019ve seen only one that works: the implementation of charter-school networks. Large enough to provide shared resources for teachers, yet insulated from bureaucratic and political crosscurrents by their independent status, these networks are creating the closest thing our country has ever seen to a rational, high-functioning school system. They have strengthened public education by extracting it from democracy as we know it\u2014and we shouldn\u2019t be surprised, because democracy as we know it is the problem.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"blah\">\n<div class=\"l-article__container__container\">\n<section id=\"article-section-5\" class=\"l-article__section s-cms-content\">\n<p class=\"dropcap\"><span class=\"smallcaps\">The network approach <\/span>is gaining traction. Although charter schools are still boutique side offerings in most parts of the country, a growing number of cities have turned them into a centerpiece, which makes <i>The Education of Eva Moskowitz<\/i> especially timely and important reading. (Last November, the president-elect paraded Moskowitz into Trump Tower during his auditions for secretary of education; after she took herself out of the running, he selected Betsy DeVos.) Today, charter schools educate 94 percent of students in one city, New Orleans, and more than 30 percent of students in 19 other cities. If a determined group of philanthropists have their way, charters will take a leading role in more cities soon. Many of these schools are part of ambitious and fast-growing networks like Success.<\/p>\n<p>In New York City, for instance, nearly 2 percent of all public-school students currently attend Success Academies, a percentage bound to climb. When I spoke with her recently, Moskowitz told me that she expects her network to expand to 100 schools in the next decade. That means Success would serve more than 50,000 students, making the network roughly the same size as Syracuse\u2019s and Buffalo\u2019s school districts combined. In Denver, meanwhile, a charter-school network called DSST Public Schools\u2014which, like Success, has regularly posted academic results well above average public-school scores\u2014will educate nearly a quarter of all middle- and high-school students in the city in the next decade. In New Orleans, four large charter networks together enroll one-third of all students who attend public school.<\/p>\n<p>If the trend continues, parents across the income spectrum won\u2019t face a tapestry of alternatives to the mainstream school district, each one with its own name and unique approach. Instead, they will get to choose from a handful of charter-school networks that are likely to make the original district\u2014the one governed by an elected school board or the mayor, depending on the city\u2014more peripheral.<picture><\/picture>\n<p>Another new book, <i>Reinventing America\u2019s Schools<\/i>, by David Osborne of the Progressive Policy Institute, describes the spread of charter schools as the shedding of an antiquated bureaucratic skin. He uses a nautical metaphor to illustrate the distinctive way charter schools work. At traditional public schools, the various layers of government are responsible for both steering and rowing. They steer by supplying funding and deciding what schools should broadly aim for: what kids should learn, and by when. The government also rows, hiring the bureaucrats and superintendents and teachers charged with meeting those goals. In the charter-school model, government responsibility ends at steering\u2014providing funding, deciding which measures of success matter, and holding schools accountable for results. Choosing whom to hire (and fire), what to pay them, what else to spend money on, how to design curricula\u2014all those decisions are contracted out to private, mostly nonprofit organizations. Those are in turn governed by boards usually\u2014in the case of larger networks like Success\u2014made up of wealthy donors.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"blah\">\n<div class=\"l-article__container__container\">\n<section id=\"article-section-6\" class=\"l-article__section s-cms-content\">Critics of charter schools, a large and vocal group, call this privatization, a word Moskowitz considers an inaccurate smear. True believers like Osborne, whose book and project at the Progressive Policy Institute are both sponsored by some of the same philanthropists promoting the Success model, call it \u201ca 21st century system.\u201d Whatever you label it, the model differs from the public schools you grew up with in another big way: Kids aren\u2019t zoned into schools by neighborhood. Families enter a lottery system, applying to the school or schools they like best and seeing where their child gets in.<\/p>\n<p>Almost everything you\u2019ve heard that\u2019s great or terrible about charter schools flows from these two big changes. Because of the difference in governance, charter-school teachers are less likely to be represented by unions. Thus, depending on whom you talk to, charters are either union-busters or mercifully free from union strictures that put teachers before students. Disciplinary policies also reflect charter schools\u2019 monopoly on rowing. Traditional public schools must follow suspension and expulsion policies written by the school district; charter schools write their own rules, and many have a no-excuses style that mandates good posture, precisely folded arms and legs, and silent hallways\u2014injunctions some hail as essential to a strong school culture and others skewer as paternalistic and inhumane.<\/p>\n<p>The lottery innovation\u2014also known as \u201cschool choice\u201d\u2014invites perhaps the most-polarized interpretations. A district can allow one of its schools to expel a student, but it still bears responsibility for making sure he is educated somewhere else. Similarly, a district has to educate every child in its purview, whether she started in kindergarten or arrived yesterday from Jamaica, and no matter how far behind she may be academically. Many charter schools, by contrast, admit students only during the once-a-year lottery, and sometimes only in certain grades. But while critics see the lottery approach as an abdication of responsibility, Moskowitz and Osborne champion it as a tool for social justice. Neighborhood schools, they argue, institutionalize housing segregation, making a child\u2019s zip code his educational destiny. Charter schools, by contrast, hand the power of choice to parents who can\u2019t afford to exercise it through real estate.<\/p>\n<p class=\"dropcap\"><span class=\"smallcaps\">What do we lose<\/span> if and when public education takes this new shape? Supporters of a charterized public-school system argue that we\u2019ll be giving up only on a fantasy, a \u201ctheoretical ideal,\u201d in Moskowitz\u2019s words. We like to think that our current public-school system is democratic. In reality, voter turnout for school-board elections\u2014the main mechanism for holding schools accountable to local communities\u2014averages between 5 and 10 percent. We dream that public schools serve all children equally well, whatever their background, race, or level of need. The reality is not even close. Many of the policies that charter schools get criticized for, moreover, are rampant in traditional public-school systems. School districts adopted \u201czero tolerance\u201d discipline before charters embraced the no-excuses approach. School districts, not charters, were the original architects of a system that divides students by race, class, and special needs and abilities. And the zones that create the beloved institution of the neighborhood school are notoriously impermeable to integration.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"blah\">\n<div class=\"l-article__container__container\">\n<section id=\"article-section-7\" class=\"l-article__section s-cms-content\">In Moskowitz\u2019s view, a charter-school system isn\u2019t just the best available compromise. It\u2019s our best shot at delivering the public-school system we wish we had. Take integration: While a majority of Success schools serve homogenous populations (mostly black and Latino students, most of them poor or low-income), the network has opened a new crop of schools in neighborhoods like the Upper West Side and Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, that are more integrated than most traditional New York City public schools. DSST, the Denver charter-school network, also embraces integration as part of its mission, and even boasts one school with a 50-50 split between white students and students of color. As a tool for bridging divides without posing a direct threat to anyone\u2019s property values, charter schools hold real promise.<\/p>\n<p>Moskowitz, meanwhile, has been advocating weighted lotteries that give preference to students from particular disadvantaged backgrounds, such as students whose first language isn\u2019t English. And in Denver and Washington, D.C., the dizzying, M. C. Escher\u2013esque system of a different lottery for every individual charter school\u2014so complicated that only the savviest families with plenty of time on their hands could be expected to successfully navigate it\u2014has been replaced by a more accessible single lottery. Worries about a lack of democracy could similarly be quieted by giving locally elected leaders more oversight of charters, an approach that reformers have adopted in Indianapolis and will try in New Orleans next year.<\/p>\n<p>I want to believe in such an evolution. It would be the best of all worlds if the most efficient way to run great schools was also the most equitable, accountable, and parent-friendly. But I worry that\u2019s hard to pull off. One problem is the lottery. Charter-school supporters say that nothing could be more liberating for parents than to grant them a direct say in which schools their children attend. But existing systems of parent choice compel a more skeptical view of the path to inclusion. A recent study of New York City\u2019s public-high-school system\u2014in which students have applied to schools outside their neighborhood for years\u2014found that parents seem to care less about the quality of the school than about the academic ability of the other students there. Left to their own choices, parents could very well resegregate schools as effectively as zip-code-based systems of assigning schools have done.<\/p>\n<p>Another problem is incentives. As Moskowitz built Success, she enforced what she calls a \u201cdual mission\u201d: first, to build schools \u201cto which any parent would want to send their children,\u201d and second, to enlist staff, students, and families in the fight for laws and policies that let Success build such schools. Her contention is that one mission reinforces the other. But does she wishfully overlook deeper tensions? For all Moskowitz\u2019s eloquence about the importance of rigorous academics and extracurricular activities, teacher after teacher has reported that at Success, test prep always comes first, narrowing the kind of work students do. Similarly, however much Moskowitz aspires to make Success Academy inclusive, in practice she and her staff sometimes tell families to look elsewhere for a school, because Success just isn\u2019t the right fit.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"blah\">\n<div class=\"l-article__container__container\">\n<section id=\"article-section-8\" class=\"l-article__section s-cms-content\">And while Moskowitz has fought to favor disadvantaged groups of students in the lottery, she has declined to fully adopt another policy that would open the schools\u2019 doors wider, a practice known in the charter world as \u201cbackfilling\u201d: When students leave partway through their schooling, other charters fill their spots with kids from the lottery\u2019s waiting list. Success backfills only in kindergarten through fourth grade. Any older than that, Moskowitz argues, and the students won\u2019t be sufficiently prepared for the school\u2019s rigorous academics.<\/p>\n<p>According to Moskowitz, the choices she\u2019s made have been pedagogically driven. Opting out of backfilling ensures that her students aren\u2019t distracted by peers who lag behind; test prep arms her students for the meritocratic ordeal ahead. At the same time, these policies clearly advance Success\u2019s reputation and help cement its political power. If those imperatives sometimes entail putting the network\u2019s organizational interests ahead of the broader well-being of students\u2014both those inside Success schools and those who are kept out\u2014the pragmatic trade-offs shouldn\u2019t be glossed over.<\/p>\n<p>Who gets to make these trade-offs? In large part, the decisions belong to Moskowitz\u2014or, more accurately, to the Success board. Charter boards, designed to sidestep the unwieldy directives of democratic school governance and focus ruthlessly on leading good schools, are the main reason charter networks operate so well\u2014and also the main reason I worry as the networks grow. Back in 2007, when I visited Harlem Success Academy, two men were also in the room with Moskowitz, the mayor, the kindergartners and first-graders, and their parents. In dark-gray suits, they stood silently at the back of the auditorium, arms crossed\u2014present, but not intrusive.<\/p>\n<p>Their names, I learned, were Joel Greenblatt and John Petry, and they were the hedge-fund managers who, as founders and board members of Harlem Success Academy, had recruited Moskowitz as their CEO. They were, I also learned, very nice gazillionaires. Petry, who graduated from the same Maryland public-school district I did, helped throw me a book party in 2014. To this day, he and his wife send their own children to Success schools. In the decade after my Harlem visit, he always cheerfully took my calls, though \u201cAsk Eva\u201d was the refrain when it came to on-the-record comments.<\/p>\n<p>Yet Petry and Greenblatt aren\u2019t just nice. They are in charge, and nobody elected them. Like Moskowitz, the two men who founded her school really want, I think, better schools for all kids, and I believe they want to achieve this by the most-ethical means possible. But as the three of them have worked at revamping and expanding the network\u2019s slice of public education, they have added new members to its board, and predictably, they have picked some of the wealthiest and most politically connected people.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"blah\">\n<div class=\"l-article__container__container\">\n<section id=\"article-section-9\" class=\"l-article__section s-cms-content\">Dip into the acknowledgments section of <i>The Education of Eva Moskowitz<\/i>and you\u2019ll find a who\u2019s who of energetic New York billionaires. She reserves the most gratitude for Daniel Loeb, the hedge-fund manager who is now the chair of Success\u2019s board. If Petry and Greenblatt are Moskowitz\u2019s Jekyll, Loeb is her unfettered Hyde. The vitriolic letters he sends to CEOs led <i>Vanity Fair <\/i>to rank his tactics among \u201cthe nastiest and most florid\u201d deployed by activist investors. The pleasure he takes in his role as provocateur extends to his involvement in education\u2014Moskowitz calls him her \u201cChief Advocacy Officer.\u201d Like Moskowitz, he seems completely confident that his ends more than justify his often hair-raising means. (He recently apologized for likening an African American elected official to a Ku Klux Klan member.) And as the number of schools under Success\u2019s direction grows, so does Loeb\u2019s power.<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t mean to suggest that Loeb and his counterparts in Denver, New Orleans, and beyond have nefarious motives. Unscrupulous school impresarios do of course exist, but they gravitate to the minority of charters that are for-profit, rather than to nonprofits like Success. But I do think that bequeathing power over the education of America\u2019s children to a tiny group of ever more influential plutocrats means that the rest of us will have much less say in the direction of public schools than we do today.<\/p>\n<p>As these networks grow, overseeing them will become both more important and more difficult. Already networks in several states have rejected requests for documents, saying that public-records laws don\u2019t apply to them. Once the Success empire includes 100, 200, or even 300 schools, will regulators feel comfortable exerting their ultimate authority to shut a school down? Or will charter networks become, like banks, too big to change?<\/p>\n<p>We can\u2019t know for sure. We can speculate, though, and when I do, I worry. The best-case scenario is that the bigger Moskowitz\u2019s network becomes, the more responsibility she and her board take\u2014not just for their students and for their network\u2019s growth, but for all students and the civic community, too. But what if well-heeled activists like Loeb decide to push for state laws that weaken regulators\u2019 power and strengthen the power of wealthy board members (and why wouldn\u2019t they)? The best we can do is hope that the same dogmatic confidence that has fueled the most promising model we have for public education won\u2019t also destroy it.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><small><i>This article was published in partnership with <\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.chalkbeat.org\/\" data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'546554'\">Chalkbeat<\/a><i>, a nonprofit news organization covering education.
