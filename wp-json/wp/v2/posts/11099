Its ruins are adjacent to modern Pamukkale and near Denizli. The hot springs have been used as a spa since the 2nd century BC, with many patrons retiring or dying there. The large necropolis is filled with sarcophagi.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>History.<\/strong> Hierapolis was founded as a thermal spa early in the 2nd\u00a0century\u00a0BC within the Seleucid Empire. Antiochus the Great sent 2,000 Jewish families to Lydia and Phrygia from Babylon and Mesopotamia, later joined by more from Judea. The Jewish congregation grew in Hierapolis and has been estimated as high as 50,000 in 62\u00a0BC.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In 190\u00a0BC, Antiochus the Great was defeated by the Roman ally Eumenes\u00a0II. Hierapolis became a healing centre where doctors used the thermal springs as a treatment for their patients.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><em>Roman Hierapolis.<\/em><\/strong> In 133\u00a0BC, when Attalus III died, he bequeathed his kingdom to Rome. In AD 17, during the rule of the emperor Tiberius, a major earthquake destroyed the city.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Through the influence of the Christian apostle Paul, a church was founded here while he was at Ephesus. The Christian apostle Philip spent the last years of his life here. The town&#8217;s Martyrium was alleged to have been built upon the spot where Philip was crucified in AD 80.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In the year 60, during the rule of Nero, an even more severe earthquake left the city completely in ruins. Afterwards, the city was rebuilt in the Roman style with imperial financial support. It was during this period that the city attained its present form. The theatre was built in 129 for a visit by the emperor Hadrian and renovated in 193. When Caracalla visited the town in 215, he bestowed the much-coveted title of neocoros upon it, according to the city certain privileges and the right of sanctuary. This was the golden age of Hierapolis. Thousands of people came to benefit from the medicinal properties of the hot springs. New building projects were started: two Roman baths, a gymnasium, several temples, a main street with a colonnade, and a fountain at the hot spring. Hierapolis became one of the most prominent cities in the Roman Empire in the fields of the arts, philosophy, and trade. The town grew to 100,000 inhabitants and became wealthy.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">During the 4th\u00a0century, Christianity had become the dominant religion and begun displacing other faiths in the area and Justinian raised the bishop of Hierapolis to the rank of metropolitan in 531. The Roman baths were transformed to a Christian basilica. During the Byzantine period, the city continued to flourish and also remained an important centre for Christianity.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><em>Medieval Hierapolis<\/em><\/strong>. In the early 7th century, the town was devastated first by Persian armies and then by another destructive earthquake, from which it took a long time to recover. In the 12th century, the area came under the control of the Seljuk sultanate of Konya before falling to Crusaders under Frederick Barbarossa and their Byzantine allies in 1190. About thirty years later, the town was abandoned before the Seljuks built a castle in the 13th century. The new settlement was abandoned in the late 14th century. In 1354, the great Thracian earthquake toppled the remains of the ancient city. The ruins were slowly covered with a thick layer of limestone.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Today.<\/strong> The Hellenistic city was built on a grid with the main street about 1,500 metres long and 13.5 metres wide bordered on both sides by an arcade.

Carbon dioxide is heavier than air and so tends to settle in hollows. The priests would then come up to show that they were miraculously immune to the gas and infused with divine protection. An enclosed area of 2,000 square metres stood in front of the entrance. It was covered by a thick layer of suffocating gas, killing anyone who dared to enter it. The priests sold birds and other animals to the visitors so that they could try out how deadly this enclosed area was. Visitors could (for a fee) ask questions of Pluto&#8217;s oracle. This provided a considerable source of income for the temple.

Phrygia was the name of an ancient Anatolian kingdom (12th-7th century BCE) and, following its demise, the term was then applied to the general geographical area it once covered in the western plateau of Asia Minor. With its capital at Gordium and a culture which curiously mixed Anatolian, Greek, and Near Eastern elements, one of the kingdom\u2019s most famous figures is the legendary King Midas, who acquired the ability to turn all that he touched to gold, even his food. Following the collapse of the kingdom after attacks by the Cimmerians in the 7th century BCE, the region came under Lydian, Persian, Seleucid, and then Roman control.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">History. The fertile plain of the western side of\u00a0Anatolia\u00a0attracted settlers from an early period, at least the early\u00a0Bronze Age, and then saw the formation of the\u00a0Hittite\u00a0state (1700-1200 BCE). The first Greek reference to Phyrgia appears in the 5th-century BCE<em>\u00a0Histories<\/em> of Herodotus (7.73). The Greeks applied the name to the Balkan immigrants who, sometime after the 12th century BCE, relocated to western Anatolia following the fall of the Hittite Empire in that region. The kingdom\u2019s traditional founder and first king were Gordios, a legendary figure, most famous today as the creator of the \u2018Gordian Knot\u2019, a fiendishly difficult piece of rope work the king had used to tether his cart. The story goes that an oracle had foretold that the person who knew how to untie the knot would rule over all of Asia, even the whole world. The cart and the knot were, incredibly, still there at Gordium when Alexander the Great (356-323 BCE) arrived a good few centuries later. Alexander was said to have heard the story and, rather unsportingly, sliced the knot open with a single blow of his sword. In other accounts, the young general slipped the pin out of the cart\u2019s yoke pole and slid the knot off that way.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The neighbouring states of Phrygia, which similarly formed out of the remnants of the Hittite Empire, were Caria (south),\u00a0Lydia\u00a0(west), and Mysia (north).\u00a0Phrygia\u2019s territory expanded to reach Daskyleon in the north and the western edge of Cappadocia. Phrygia prospered thanks to the fertile land, its location between the Persian and Greek worlds, and the skills of the state\u2019s metalworkers and potters. Chamber tombs, especially at the capital Gordium, have distinctive doorways and their excavated contents have revealed both the use of the language of\u00a0Indo-European\u00a0Phrygian (from the 8th century BCE) and the wealth which gave rise to the legend of the fabulously rich King Midas (see below).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Phrygia was conquered by the Cimmerians in the 7th century BCE but the period of domination by Lydia and\u00a0Persia\u00a0has left an impoverished archaeological record.\u00a0Phrygia continued to be used as a label of convenience for the general and ill-defined geographical area which had once been ruled by the now-defunct kingdom of that name.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">After the campaigns of Alexander the Great, the region of Phrygia\/Lydia came under the control of one of Alexander\u2019s successors,\u00a0Antigonus I\u00a0(382-301 BCE). Shortly after, Anatolia became a part of the\u00a0Seleucid Empire\u00a0c. 280 BCE. As a consequence of this takeover, many settlers came from ancient\u00a0Macedon\u00a0and their\u00a0Hellenistic\u00a0culture with them. Notable Phrygian towns in this period besides Gordium included Hierapolis, Laodikeia by the Lykos (aka Laodicea), Aizanoi, Apamea, and Synnada, although most of the region&#8217;s population lived in small, agriculturally-based villages.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Phrygia became a part of the Roman province of Asia (with a part in\u00a0Galatia, too) in 116 BCE.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Phrygia then became embroiled in the Mithridatic Wars of the 1st century BCE between Rome and the kings of Pontus. With the reign of\u00a0Augustus\u00a0(27 BCE &#8211; 14 CE), there followed a period of peace and stability in the region. Prosperity was ensured by the continued fertility of the land and the important marble quarries near Dokimeion &#8211; stone from there would be used in such buildings as Trajan\u2019s Forum in Rome and the Library of Celsus at Ephesus. Into the 3rd century CE, the culture of the region had become a mix of indigenous Anatolian, Greek, Roman, Jewish, and Christian practices and customs.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>King Midas.<\/strong> Perhaps the most famous figure from Phrygia\u2019s long history is Midas(r. 738\u00a0BCE &#8211; c. 696\u00a0BCE), the king who reputedly could turn anything he wished into gold. According to the legend, Midas had helped the satyr Silenus recover from the morning-after effects of a night of overdrinking and restored him to his master, the god of wine\u00a0Dionysos. In gratitude, the god granted Midas a single wish and so the king gained his ability to turn anything he touched into gold. Rather too good to be true, this skill proved a bit of a problem when Midas wanted to eat or drink as even these things changed into the precious\u00a0metal. Asking Dionysos to withdraw his wish, Midas was told he could lose the bothersome ability if he washed in the river Pactolus in Lydia (a river, not coincidentally, famous for its gold dust deposits). Midas might have been a wealthy mortal but he seems to have been unlucky with the gods twice. In another unfortunate encounter, this time with\u00a0Apollo, the king offended the deity when he was asked to judge who was the better musician,\u00a0Pan\u00a0or Apollo. Midas unwisely chose Pan, and a displeased Apollo turned the king\u2019s obviously tone-deaf ears to those of a donkey. The king was obliged to wear a turban for the rest of his days.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Gordium. The\u00a0capital of the kingdom Gordium, the\u00a0city\u00a0was strategically located at the point where the main land route to the east coast &#8211; often called the Persian \u2018Royal Road\u2019 &#8211; crossed the ancient Sangarios River (modern name Sakarya River and about 100 km or 62 miles west of Ankara). The settlement likely became the most important one in the Phrygian kingdom from the 10th century BCE.\u00a0Gordium was sacked by the Cimmerians during their invasion of the region but did recover, albeit never really regaining anything like its former glory. The Romans destroyed the town during their campaign against the Galatians in 189 BCE, and by the 1st century CE, it was nothing more than a village.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Impressive remains which can be visited today include the well-preserved\u00a0Temple\u00a0of Zeus at Aizinoi (92 CE), the Roman\u00a0theatre\u00a0at Hierapolis (2nd century CE), and the Temple A at Laodicea (2nd century CE).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>L\u00fcbbey.<\/strong> In the NM \u201csmall towns\u201d series, this was a slow drive 28 km south of Sardis.

Lycia was a geopolitical region in Anatolia in what is now Antalya and Mugla on the southern coast of Turkey. Lycia voluntarily incorporated into the Achaemenid empire in the Iron Age (546 BC), their language disappeared and the area had an influx of Persian speakers. <strong><br \/>\n<\/strong>Lycia fought for the Persians in the Persian Wars, was defeated by the Greeks (part of the Athenian Empire), came under the Persians, revolted, returned to the Persians and finally became Macedonian under Alexander the Great when it became thoroughly Hellenized. On defeating Antiochus III in 188 BC the Romans gave Lycia to Rhodes for 20 years, taking it back in 168 BC. In these latter stages of the Roman Republic Lycia came to enjoy freedom as a Roman protectorate. The Romans validated home rule officially under the Lycian League in 168 BC. This native government was an early federation with republican principles. Despite home rule, Lycia was not a sovereign state and had not been since its defeat by the Carians. In 43 AD the Roman emperor Claudius dissolved the league, and Lycia was incorporated into the Roman Empire with provincial status. It became an eparchy of the Eastern, or Byzantine Empire, continuing to speak Greek even after being joined by communities of Turkish language speakers in the early 2nd millennium. After the fall of the Byzantine Empire in the 15th century, Lycia was under the Ottoman Empire and was inherited by the Turkish Republic on the fall of that empire.

Halicarnassus (modern Bodrum, Turkey) was an ancient Ionian Greek city of Caria, located on the Gulf of Cerameicus in Anatolia. According to tradition, it was founded by Dorian Greeks of the Peloponnese. The most famous of her sons, the historian Herodotus, wrote that in early times the city participated in the Dorian festival of Apollo at Triopion, but the city\u2019s literature and culture appear completely Ionic and Herodotus\u2019 <em>Histories<\/em>\u00a0were written in Ionic Greek.

Will Durant writes:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>The sculptural masterpiece of the period [4th century BCE] was the great mausoleum dedicated to King Mausolus of Halicarnassus.

A great\u00a0wall\u00a0circuit, public buildings, and a secret dockyard and canal were built as well as many well-ordered roads and temples to the gods.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The city was besieged by Alexander the Great in 334 BCE (the famous Siege of Halicarnassus) where he almost suffered defeat (it would have been his only one) but, at the last minute, his infantry broke the walls and burned the Persian ships. The Persian commander, Memnon of Rhodes, realizing the city was lost, set fire to it and fled. The fire consumed most of the city. Alexander set his ally, Ada of Caria, to rule Halcarnassus and she, in turn, formally adopted him as her son so that his bloodline would always reign in the city he had taken from the Persians.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">After Alexander\u2019s death, however, rule of the city passed to\u00a0Antigonus I\u00a0(311 BCE),\u00a0Lysimachus\u00a0(after 301 BCE) and the Ptolemies (281\u2013197 BCE) and was briefly an independent kingdom until 129 BCE when it came under\u00a0Roman\u00a0rule.

The ruins of the city were extensively excavated in 1856\u201357 CE and again in 1865 CE and much of its great wall, the\u00a0gymnasium, a late colonnade, a\u00a0temple\u00a0platform, rock-cut tombs and the site of the Mausoleum (littered with those stones not used by the knights) may still be seen today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Archaeological Site of Priene<\/strong>.

Located 7.5 km up a switchbacking road above the city of Siljuk. Its name means &#8220;cute&#8221; in Turkish, and used to be called &#8220;\u00c7irkince,&#8221; meaning &#8220;ugly.&#8221; This was an ironic take on the beauty of the village and also used to ward off others. As people wised up to how spectacular the village&#8217;s location and architecture were, they changed the name to \u015eirince in 1926.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The two-storey architecture is special and any new building is required to align with the aesthetic of the village, which is under preservation. The homes are connected through windy, cobbled, narrow streets. Its location on a hill and its fertile fields have made it a haven for vineyards, olive orchards (with great local olive oil), peaches, figs, apples, walnuts and more.<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.goturkey.com\/htcontents\/uploaded\/images\/street.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/> It is well-known for fresh produce, and a special Turkish breakfast with an\u00a0array of cheeses, olives, tomatoes, cucumbers and jams. Local herbs are used in many of the more substantial meals, picked from the hills and often cooked using local olive oil.<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.goturkey.com\/htcontents\/uploaded\/images\/shopping.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/> The \u015eirince bazaar is one of the better markets on the Aegean coast with foodstuffs, the freshest produce, trinkets, souvenirs, jewelry, soaps, dried fruit, and handmade clothing. Turkish coffee is brewed using a pan filled with hot sand that makes the coffee taste strong and thick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Doganbey.\u00a0<\/strong>Many travellers certainly know the abandoned Greek village Kayak\u00f6y near Fethiye on the Lycian coast. Its ruined houses evoke the memories of ancient Greek inhabitants of Turkey. However, few people know that a very similar place exists on the Aegean coast, close to the renowned holiday resort of Ku\u015fadas\u0131.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Originally called Domatia, after 1924, Do\u011fanbey was settled by the Turks, but in the 80s of the 20th century, they left the village in search of more modern conditions of life. Since then the village has remained uninhabited. As a result, it managed to retain its original character and old buildings in the state from almost a hundred years ago. Some of the buildings have been restored and sold as holiday homes, but many old houses are still falling into disrepair.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Currently, Do\u011fanbey is a village museum, where you can admire the beautiful examples of traditional architecture of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Among the old houses, there is also a historic church and a chapel. The village is divided by a deep ravine where the stream flows. There is an Information Centre<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In the NM &#8220;small town series&#8221;, the road from\u00a0 Sirince to here was twisty following the coast, then turned into a 6-lane divided to Cesme.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00c7ESME<\/strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u00a0and <\/span><strong>Karaburun Peninsula<\/strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">. Extending west from Izmir, this seaside town has ferries to Chios, the main island in the Greek northern Aegean Islands. I booked a ferry to Chios for December 22 with plans to eat Greek food for 3 days over Christmas. But the ferry was cancelled because of high winds. That ferry line had no sailings until 18:30 on Dec 26 so I would have returned to Turkey on the 28th and had a very rushed drive to get the ferry from Greece to Venice on Dec 31. But I was able to get a passenger-only ferry on the 23rd so went to Chios for the day and gave me almost 4 more days to get to the other side of Greece.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>\u00c7e\u015fme Castle.<\/strong> This impressive large castle on the waterfront of Cesme has a large square keep, mosque and museum.

Its prehistory dates to the second millennia BC. The city survived Persian domination and the conquest of Alexander the Great.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Pergamon was an important kingdom during the second century BC, having grown from a city-state captured by Alexander the Great. Upon Alexander\u2019s death in 323 BC, his generals fought for control of the parts of his empire. Lysimachus took command of the Aegean coast but was killed in 281 BC, leaving Pergamum in control of Philetarus the Eunuch (283-263 BC), who used Lysimachus\u2019s treasure to increase his power.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The most brilliant phase of its history lasted almost one hundred and fifty years when it was the capital of the Kingdom of Pergamon during the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC. Philetarus\u2019s nephew and heirs built on their inheritance, and Eumenes II (197-159 BC), King of Pergamon, became the most powerful ruler in Anatolia. At this time, one of the largest libraries of the world was built here and the city became a healing centre. The arts also flourished, and the city particularly became renowned for magnificent sculptures. He beautified his capital city by building the Altar of Zeus, by constructing numerous buildings in the \u201cmiddle city\u201d on the slope of the Acropolis, and by expanding and beautifying the Asclepion Medical Center. At the Sanctuary of Asclepius, one of the principal healing centres of antiquity, the patients were treated with the sound of water, mud baths and waters of a healing spring. Pergamon was also the home of physician Galen, the father of pharmacology, making the city stand out in the history of medicine and pharmacology.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Eumenes II\u2019s son\u00a0Attalus III (159-129 BC) was not his father\u2019s equal. Pergamum\u2019s power declined, and on Attalus\u2019s death, the Kingdom of Pergamum was\u00a0willed to\u00a0Rome and became its\u00a0Province of Asia\u00a0(Minor).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">During the Roman period, Pergamon maintained its significance and developed further becoming &#8220;the most famous and magnificent city of the Asia Minor&#8221;, as described by the 1st century AD philosopher and author Pliny the Elder. Roman Pergamum was still a rich, important city. Some of its most important monuments, such as the Temple of Trajan, date from Roman times. The Serapis Temple dedicated to Egyptian gods was one of the principal structures of the Roman era and it was renowned as the Red Basilica due to the colour of the bricks used.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">During the Byzantine era, this noticeably huge structure was converted to a church, which is one of the first Seven Churches cited in the Bible.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Firsts.\u00a0<\/strong>Pergamon had many firsts in its history. One of the most significant of these was the first-ever use of parchment. The invention of the script has been a breakthrough in the history of humanity, and the innovation of parchment was quite important as it created a medium, enabling quick and stable recording of scripts. The development of parchment allowed Pergamon to create a library of 200,000 manuscripts that rivalled the world-renowned library of Alexandria and paved the way to develop the city as an important centre of arts and science in the 2nd century BC. The Pergamon Gymnasium was one the most important learning institutions of the Hellenistic Era.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Pergamon had one of the first Seven Churches of early Christianity, the first theatre with a wooden stage; the first trade union; the first market law; the first public building regulation; and the first strike and collective agreement amongst other firsts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Open Air Museum.<\/strong> Pergamon sits on top of the mountain or the Acropolis.

Continue along the edge of the ridge for wonderful views down to a reservoir to the north. At the 5m wide well, start on the boardwalk that continues on the ridge, past the arsenal and aqueduct, cross back through the walls and reach the Sanctuary of Trajan, the only real thing of much interest to see. Surrounded by fluted marble columns (only some connected by a capital) and a plaza, the temple is an elevated platform in the center. 6 columns, part of a capital and the gable end are reconstructed on the platform.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The storyboards here are the worst I have ever seen giving a lot of boring information about the reconstruction and little about what is here.

Today\u2019s\u00a0Bergama\u00a0contains examples of the Seljuk and Ottoman architecture, such as mosques, bathhouses and bridges. Most prominent of these include the Ulu Cami (the Grand Mosque), Sel\u00e7uklu Minaresi (the Seljuk Minaret), \u015ead\u0131rvan Cami (the Ablution Fountain Mosque), \u00c7ukur Han (the Sunk Caravanserai), and Ta\u015f Han (the Stone Caravanserai). There are also examples of 18th and 19th century civil architecture at the Kale Mahallesi (Citadel Neighbourhood) which is situated at the lower slopes of the hill where the Pergamon city was once built.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The art of sculpture reached its peak in the 2nd century BC in Pergamon and statues created in that era are admired even today. The Pergamon style became one of the principal schools of sculpture, magnificent examples of which can be seen in the Museum of Bergama. The most striking works are the statues of gods, goddesses and emperors, which were unearthed in the excavations<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The thermal springs of Pergamon made the city one of the principal centres of healing and beauty in antiquity, and many of them reached our times. One of the major thermal spas of Pergamon is within the Sanctuary of Asclepius (G\u00fczellik Il\u0131cas\u0131) which is 4 km from Bergama. It is believed to have been commissioned by King Euamens of Pergamon and provided beautifying services to Cleopatra who enjoyed bathing there.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ege (Izmir, Aydin, Mu\u011fla, Afyonkarahisar, Denizli) April 23-26, December 22-24, 2019 I drove through here three times, my last time on my way back to Europe over Christmas.
