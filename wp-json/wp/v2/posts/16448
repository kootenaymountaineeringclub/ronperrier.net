It lies just north of Trinidad and Tobago, and southwest of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. It is famous for spices and is known as the \u201cSpice Isle\u201d, being a major source of nutmeg, cloves, ginger, cinnamon, vanilla and cocoa.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Capital:<\/strong>\u00a0St George\u2019s<br \/>\n<strong>Currency:<\/strong>\u00a0East Caribbean dollar \u201c$\u201d or \u201cEC$\u201d (XCD)US$1 \u2248 EC$2.7 (pegged).<br \/>\n<strong>Population<\/strong>: 197,800<br \/>\n<strong>Language.\u00a0<\/strong>English and English-based Creole.<br \/>\n<strong>Country Code:<\/strong>\u00a0+1473<br \/>\n<strong>Visa<\/strong>\u00a0Most western countries visa free.<br \/>\n<strong>Covid.<\/strong> No tests required and independent tours offered.

They stretch over a distance of 90 km from the Island of London Bridge in the south to Bequia in the north. Geographically, the area lies along the interface of the Caribbean and South American Tectonic plates. Several active undersea mounts (e.g. Kick\u2019em Jenny) attest to the on-going movement of these plates.<br \/>\nThe international boundary between Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines runs east to west across the bank between Petit Martinique and Petit St. Vincent. Links are historically strong and continue to be active. Fishing, informal trade, tourism and island social life proceed with little attention to the boundary.<br \/>\nNine (9) islands have permanent settlements. The largest islands \u2013 Bequia, Mustique, Canouan, Mayreau, Union I., Petit Martini\u00e9ue and Carriacou, have towns and communities with public (schools, clinics, utilities) and private supporting infrastructure. Others are resort islands- Palm I, Petit St. Vincent. Most others are visited by yachters and fishers: 1.Petit Martinique 2. Petite Tobago 3. Carriacou 4. Saline Island\u00a05. Frigate Island 6. Large Island\u00a07. Diamond Island\u00a08. Les Tantes\u00a09. Ronde Island\u00a010. Caille Island\u00a011. London Bridge<br \/>\nThe islands of the Grenadines range from rocky volcanic headlands to tiny cays that barely rise above sea level. The largest islands are Carriacou (3400 ha) and Bequia in St. Vincent (1800 ha). Although many of the islands are inhabited and used for agriculture and the surrounding waters for commercial fishing, much of the area still exists in a relatively undisturbed condition.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nCARRIACOU<br \/>\n<\/strong>90-minute ferry ride on the Osprey fast ferry: departs 9am and returns to Georgetown at 3:30pm &#8211; $31 one way or a 20 minute flight on SVG Air to\u00a0Carriacou. (Return: 160 EC$ &#8211; I gave a US$100 and received a 100EC$ back)<br \/>\nWe arrived in George Town at 07:15, had breakfast and walked to the ferry terminal about 15 minutes through the tunnel and around the corniche. The ferry didn\u2019t finish loading until 09:35 and arrived in Carriacou at Argyll Bay at 11:20.<br \/>\nIt is 5.7 km to Carriacou town (share taxi 3.50 EC$). I had a delicious banana\/chocolate\/peanut smoothie (12 EC$), chatted with the women there and saw the \u201dsights\u201d.<br \/>\n<strong>Carriacou Museum. <\/strong>In the back of a store, the small room has a some history and a few artifacts with little of interest. 15 EC$<br \/>\n<strong>Old Sugar Mill. <\/strong>2.6km above Carriacoa, I took a share bus to the Belair Windmill, one of eight that powered cotton, corn and sugar mills on the island, two on the Belair Estate. Built by enslaved Africans in the 1770s, this one was used for cotton (the primary crop grown on the estate until the early 19<sup>th<\/sup> century) and corn. The sister tower at the top of Belair was used for sugar where the sugar works are, but there is little left here. I decided to walk down which turned out to be a good decision as not one share bus came by. I had another smoothie and caught the bus back to the ferry.<br \/>\nNear the ferry is Paradise Beach, the main snorkelling beach. Apparently the visibility was poor (high tides and wind) and there was little to see. There was a group of veterinary students on the boat<\/p>\n<p><strong>Petite Martinique<\/strong>. XL . Ferry also goes here from Carriacou 7:15am and 2:15pm $8<\/p>\n<p><strong>GRENADA<br \/>\nSt. GEORGE\u2019S\u00a0<\/strong>\u2018<br \/>\n<strong>ST. GEORGE FORTIFIED SYSTEM.\u00a0<\/strong>Tentative WHS (05\/08\/2004).\u00a0Although a fort from the period of initial European settlement was already in existence the true start was Fort George (1706-1710) which then gradually evolved on the ridges of the hills that enclose St. George\u2019s and its natural harbour like a giant amphitheatre. In its heydays the system consisted of eight forts, designed to mitigate internal Amerindian attacks and slave uprisings, as well as external European rival invasions. At the time of their establishment, each fort progressively incorporated the latest design concepts to facilitate advancing technological achievements of the period, showing today the development of French .and British military engineering adjusted to Grenadian circumstances.<br \/>\nThe three major forts of the system have been preserved to the present day. Fort George is associated with all the periods of Grenada\u2019s history up to its contemporary period, as the execution of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop in October 1983 was carried out at Fort George. The fort currently houses the Police Headquarters and Police Training School. Fort Frederick is restored and is open to the public. Fort Matthew was converted into a lunatic asylum to serve the entire Windward Island in 1880 and was abandoned in 1987 when a new asylum at Mt. Gay was opened. It is currently in a bad state of repair. The other military structures have either disappeared or fallen to ruins.<br \/>\n<strong>Fort Frederick.\u00a0<\/strong>Constructed by the French in 1779, Fort Frederick was soon used by the British, although it never fired a cannon in anger. It\u2019s the island\u2019s best-preserved fort with short tunnels at the base. Atop Richmond Hill at the center of St. George\u2019s, Fort Frederick is a bastion type fort, which offers a 360 view of St. George\u2019s.<br \/>\n<strong>Fort George.\u00a0<\/strong>Built in 1706 \u2013 1710, it was renamed Fort George in 1763, in honour of King George III when the British took possession of the island. It is basically a small bastion tracer fort, once the heart of the town. Currently, it houses the Royal Grenada Police force, but has sections which are open to the public.<br \/>\nThere is a viewing section towards the inner harbour with plaques showing the important landmarks, and several of the old cannons. The stroll up to the fort from town is a bit of a climb. While it may not have the God\u2019s eye view of Fort Frederick, see and feel a living fort which has not outlived its usefulness to this day. Access from next to the exit to the Sendall tunnel via steps.<br \/>\nInside are some fallen down buildings, microwave towers and buildings that appear to be lived in. $2<br \/>\n<strong>GEORGE HISTORIC DISTRICT.<\/strong>Tentative WHS (05\/08\/2004).\u00a0The urban pattern consists of a planned part and an unplanned part, separated by the ridge of a mountain with Church Street, the spine of St George\u2019s. The planned part is a grid system with a central square after fires razed the town in 1771 and 1775, requiring buildings to be made of brick or masonry with clay tile roofs and laid out as detached units instead of row houses. Also Georgian architecture adjusted to Caribbean circumstances<br \/>\nThe unplanned part has been shaped by the natural harbour of St George\u2019s and the contour lines of the surrounding hills from the early nineteenth century onwards. Historic buildings here are wood in a vernacular Caribbean style.<br \/>\n<strong>Grenada National Museum. <\/strong>The door was open and I walked in to an empty museum (except for some old sewing machines). I was then informed it was closed.<br \/>\n<strong>St. George\u2019s Anglican Church. <\/strong>A lovely church with a wood ceiling and wood beams.<br \/>\n<strong>St.Andrew\u2019s Presbyterian Church. <\/strong>Under construction, only the original clock\/bell tower remains.

Bizzarium. Designed in 2007 by British sculptor Jason deCaires Taylor, it has been listed as one of the Top 25 Wonders of the World by National Geographic. Taylor\u2019s objective wasn\u2019t only artistic. He intended the sculpture to contribute to the environmental sustainability of the bay by offering a habitat for marine life, including corals, algae and sponges. The sculptures may have begun their life a single gray color, but over the years became a melange of pinks, greens, yellows and black. One of the delights of exploring the park is seeing the transformation of the sculptures as well as fish darting in and around them.<br \/>\nThe life-size sculptures range from whimsical figures, such as a bicycle rider and a man sitting at a desk tapping away at a typewriter, to more poetic installations, including the female figures of \u201cGrace Reef\u201d who are at times hidden by the sand and then revealed again by the tides. One of the most emotionally impactful installations is a ring of life-size figures holding hands, titled \u201cVicissitudes.\u201d The figures represent Grenadian schoolchildren and are now multicolored and covered with barnacles \u2014 thus making the vision more affecting than when first installed.\u00a0Access via boat in guided tours to snorkel above the figures. Divers get an intimate look at the changes wrought by time and the sea.<br \/>\n14 new sculptures include \u201cThe Silent Cry\u201d by Rene Froehlich, a stirring depiction of a female figure wrapped in the roots of a tree; and a selection of Amerindian sculptures inspired by ancient Amerindian art by Troy Lewis.<br \/>\nThis can only be accessed by boat as it sits beside cliffs.<br \/>\n<strong>Annandale Falls.\u00a0<\/strong>Kids jumping into the pool try to charge.<br \/>\n<strong>Grand Etang NP and Lake.\u00a0<\/strong>A\u00a0crater lake\u00a0in an\u00a0extinct volcano\u00a0responsible for the formation of the Island Grenada which hasn\u2019t erupted in 1-2 million years ago. It is located\u00a0530\u00a0m (1,740\u00a0ft) above sea level, is approximately 20 feet deep and 36 acres in area\u00a0and is also rumored to be home to a mermaid living in the depths that lure men to their watery grave.<br \/>\nOne is able to discover distinct eco-zones because of the park\u2019s varied elevation. A self-guided hike around the azure-colored lake along a trail goes past waterfalls and through jungle. Tropical birds, tiny bright-chartreuse\u00a0lizards, a variety of orchids, and armadilloes can be seen. Mount Qua Qua can be seen across the lake. Trail hikes range from 15 minutes to 4 hours.\u00a0Mona monkeys\u00a0can also be seen overhead in the forest.<br \/>\n<strong>Seven Sisters Waterfall.\u00a0<\/strong>2.1km trail (often muddy but with wood steps), gains 183m.

Its pond is one of the most important wildlife habitats on the island, the first and only RAMSAR site on the island of Grenada.<br \/>\nBeautiful Levera Beach has views of the three offshore islands of Sugar Loaf, Green and Sandy Islands.
