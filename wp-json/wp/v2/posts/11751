It is surrounded on one side by the main channel of the Ile River and on the other side by the Canal du Faux-Rempart, a canalized arm of the river. It was listed as a WHS in 1988 as an old quarter that exemplifies medieval cities. To mark this, 22 brass plates were placed on the bridges giving access to the island.<br \/>\nIt is sometimes referred to an \u201cellipse insulaire, as it is 1.25kms at is longest and .75kms at its broadest. At the center lies Place Kl\u00e9ber, the city\u2019s central square. Further south is the Strasbourg Cathedral. At the western end is the quarter of Petite France, the former home of the city\u2019s tanners, millers and fisherman and now a main tourist attraction. The former fluvial customs house, Ancienne Douane is also on the island.<br \/>\nThere are four other churches on the island: St Thomas, St Pierre-le-Vieux, St Pierre-le-Jeune and St Etienne. Also the Episcopal palace of the Archdiocese of Strasbourg.<br \/>\nHotels Particulares and Palaces: Palais Rohan, H\u00f4tel des Deux-Ponts (birthplace of Ludwig I of Bavaria and now home to the city\u2019s military governor), H\u00f4tel de Klinglin, H\u00f4tel d\u2019Andlau-Klinlin, H\u00f4tel de Neuwiller and others.<br \/>\nI walked around about half the island next to the canal to the bridge and then back through the center via Place Kl\u00e9ber.<br \/>\n<strong>Strasbourg Cathedral<\/strong> (Cathedral Notre Dame de Strasbourg). Considered to be among the finest examples of high, or late Gothic architecture. It was the world\u2019s tallest church and building from 1647-1874. Today it is the 6<sup>th<\/sup> tallest church in the world and highest extant structure built entirely in the Middle Ages. It is built of sandstone from the Vosges Mountains giving it its characteristic pink hue.<br \/>\nThe site was first a Roman sanctuary, then a cathedral at the end of the 7<sup>th<\/sup> century (nothing remains of it today). It caught fire in 873, 1002 and 1007. This cathedral was started in 1015 with a Romanesque style, but it burned to the ground in 1176.<br \/>\n<strong><em>Construction<\/em><\/strong> 1176-1439. Started in Romanesque, it changed to Gothic in 1225. The Pillar of Angels in the south transept has the Last Judgment facing the Astronomical clock from that time. The west front is decorated with thousands of figures in a series of rotated octagons. The octagonal north tower was built from 1399-1419, the world\u2019s tallest building at the time. The south tower was never built giving it an asymmetrical appearance. The Saint Lawrence portal\u2019s statues are copies with the originals in the Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019\u0152uvre Notre Dame. It was proclaimed protestant in 1524 and the world\u2019s first Christmas was set up inside in 1539. It returned to Catholic in 1681. Hitler visited in 1940 and the stained glass was removed and stored in a salt mine. Bombs heavily damaged it and these were not completely repaired until 1990.<br \/>\n<strong><em>Dimensions:<\/em><\/strong> 112m long (103m inside), one dome 58m high, spire height 142m, height of observation deck 66m.<br \/>\n<strong><em>Stained glass windows<\/em><\/strong>: mostly 14<sup>th<\/sup> century, the northern lateral nave is lit by 5 windows of the 19 emperors of the Holy Roman Empire.<br \/>\n<strong><em>Astronomical clock<\/em><\/strong>. Preceded by two other clocks, the present clock dates from 1838-43, it indicates leap years, equinoxes, computus (date of Easter), solar time, the day of the week, the month, the year, the sign of the zodiac, the phase of the moon and the position of several planets. The animated sculpted figures launch into movement at different hours of the day. One angel sounds the bell while a second turns over an hourglass. Figures ranging from a child to an old man parade in front of Death. All these are put into motion at 12:30.<br \/>\n\u20ac8 to climb the tower.<br \/>\n<strong>Palais Rohan<\/strong> (Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg). The riverside is light sandstone, the rest is pink. I doesn\u2019t seem to be open to the public even though there is supposed to be a museum there.<br \/>\n<strong>Barrage Vauban.<\/strong> This 2-story stone bridge is completely enclosed with 12 double windows per side. Walk through the 2m wide bottom section with rooms on each side, some containing plaster, stone and terracotta statues of saints, gargoyles and others. There are two drawbridge mechanisms. Free<\/p>\n<p><strong>Niederhaslach Church<\/strong> (Collegiale Saint Florent), Niederhaslach. About 35kms SW of Strasbourg, this Gothic church has a nice portal of the nativity and flying buttresses coming off Gothic towers to hold the whole place up. I had hoped that it would be open early.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Natzweiler-Struthof Camp<\/strong>. In the NM \u201cThe Dark Side\u201d, this is the only concentration camp in present day France and one of the few mountain camps. It was opened in May, 1941 to work a vein of granite at the top of Mount Louise (800m). It had 52,000 inmates from 30 different European countries in the camp or one of its 70 satellite camps, the majority resistance members but also a small number of Soviet POWs, Jews, Roma and Jehovah Witnesses. It was closed in September, 1944 to the other side of the Rhine.<br \/>\nDrive about 7kms up the mountain. See the museum, the European Center of Deported Resistance Members, camp, necropolis, sand and granite quarries and the gas chamber.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Chateau du Haut-Koenigsbourg,<\/strong> Orschwiller. It was first mentioned as Hohenstaufin&#8217;s Castle in the 11th century and was destroyed in 1462. In 1479, it was given to the Hapsburgs who reconstructed it and equipped it for defence against artillery. During the 30 Years War, the Swedes pillaged it and it became neglected. It was gifted to Emperor Wilhelm II by the town in 1899 and he restored it to 1479 standards from 1900-18 after which it was returned to France.<br \/>\nDrive up a long switchbacking road to the top of the mountain. The castle sits on huge foundation rocks with the star shaped bastion at one end and the south facade an imposing sight above you as you come up the path. See the reconstructed bailey, half timbered house (the former stables and inn) and the Haut Chateau. A wonderful small wood windmill sits on top of one of the towers of the chateau.<br \/>\nEnglish guided tours are at 11:45 and 15:00.\u00a0\u20ac10<\/p>\n<p><em>The view from the castle was one of the best in the world \u2013 a vast plain for many miles with low hills on the horizon. This turned out to be one gigantic vineyard \u2013 La Vin d\u2019Alsace and I was on the wine route \u2013 lots of traffic, tour buses, tractors pulling carts full of big plastic tubs full of grapes. The tiny villages were all very cute with half-timbered houses, plaster houses in many pastel colours, town centers with all the houses joined, narrow pedestrianized lanes and lots of wine stores.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Riquewihr<\/strong>. A NM \u201csmall town\u201d, it is a popular tourist attraction for its historical\u00a0architecture, Riquewihr is also known for the\u00a0Riesling\u00a0and other great wines produced in the village. Riquewihr looks today more or less as it did in the 16th century. It is officially one of the most beautiful villages in France, or\u00a0Les plus beaux villages de France. It is located on the Route des Vins (The Wines Road), close to Colmar. Riquewihr is only 11kms from\u00a0Colmar and minutes from other Alsatian villages such as\u00a0Ribeauvill\u00e9,\u00a0Hunawihr,\u00a0Eguisheim\u00a0or\u00a0Kaysersberg.<br \/>\nOriginally the property of the\u00a0Dukes of W\u00fcrttemberg, the town was converted to\u00a0Protestantism\u00a0in the 16th century. Historically, Riquewihr served as a\u00a0Winzerdorf\u00a0or &#8220;wine village&#8221; as a trading hub for Alsatian and\u00a0German wine.<br \/>\nRiquewihr was one of the few towns in the area not to be badly damaged during\u00a0World War II. The town is surrounded by its\u00a0medieval\u00a0fortifications\u00a0and is overlooked by a castle from the same period that is today a museum.<br \/>\n<strong>Kayserberg.<\/strong> A NM \u201csmall town\u201d, is a former\u00a0commune, in 2016, it was merged into the new commune\u00a0Kaysersberg-Vignoble. The inhabitants are called\u00a0Kaysersbergeois. The name is German for\u00a0Emperor&#8217;s Mountain.<br \/>\nThe high fortress that dominates the city serves as a reminder of both its strategic importance and its warlike past. Together with the rest of\u00a0Alsace-Lorraine, Kaysersberg was annexed by Germany during a period of 48 years, between the\u00a0Franco-Prussian War\u00a0and the\u00a0First World War.<br \/>\nKaysersberg is one of the finest wine-growing areas in Alsace. The first vines were brought there in the 16th century from\u00a0Hungary, and wine production is still an important aspect of the town&#8217;s economy today. Wine produced from the\u00a0pinot gris\u00a0variety is a local specialty.<br \/>\nKaysersberg was the birthplace of\u00a0Albert Schweitzer\u00a0(1875\u20131965), theologian, musician, philosopher, and physician.<br \/>\n<strong>Albert Schweitzer museum<\/strong>. The 1952 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Doctor Albert Schweitzer. The museum is in the heart of his hometown of Kaysersberg. It tells the story of how the hospital in Lambarene, Gabon, was founded in 1913 and then developed by Schweitzer, an Alsatian doctor, theologian and musicologist. Written documents, photographs and some of the doctor&#8217;s personal memorabilia are on display. There are also various African artefacts stemming from this region of Gabon. \u20ac4<\/p>\n<p><strong>COLMAR <\/strong>(68,000)<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong>German during 1871\u20131918 and 1940\u20131945, the city is renowned for its well-preserved old town, its numerous architectural landmarks, and its museums, among which is the Unterlinden Museum, which houses the Isenheim Altarpiece. Colmar is situated on the Alsatian Wine Route and considers itself to be the &#8220;capital of Alsatian wine&#8221;.<br \/>\nColmar was first mentioned by Charlemagne in his chronicle about Saxon wars. This was the location where the Carolingian Emperor Charles the Fat held a diet in 884. Colmar was granted the status of a free imperial city by Emperor Frederick II in 1226. In 1354 it joined the D\u00e9capole city league. The city adopted the Protestant Reformation in 1575, long after the northern neighbours of Strasbourg and S\u00e9lestat. The city was conquered by France under King Louis XIV in 1673. In 1854 cholera epidemic decimated population of the city. With the rest of Alsace, Colmar was annexed by the newly formed German Empire in 1871 as a result of the Franco-Prussian War and incorporated into the Alsace-Lorraine province. It returned to France after World War I according to the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1940, and then reverted to French control after the battle of the &#8220;Colmar Pocket&#8221; in 1945. The Colmar Treasure, a hoard of precious objects hidden by Jews during the Black Death, was discovered here in 1863.<br \/>\nColmar is 64kms SSE of Strasbourg on the Lauch River, a tributary of the Ill. It is located directly to the east of the Vosges and connected to the Rhine in the east by a canal.<br \/>\n<strong>Mus\u00e9e d&#8217;Unterlinden.<\/strong> One of the main museums in Alsace. Displays the\u00a0Isenheim Altarpiece (a retable of the life of Christ, seen both open and closed and many paintings both sides), a large collection of Greco-Roman, medieval, Renaissance and baroque\u00a0Upper-Rhenish\u00a0paintings and sculptures, archaeological artefacts, design and international modern art. \u20ac13<br \/>\n<strong>Mus\u00e9e Bartholdi.<\/strong> Auguste Bartholdi (1834-1904) was a French sculptor most known for the Statue of Liberty, a gift from France on the 100<sup>th<\/sup> anniversary of American independence \u2013 46m high, 300 molded copper plates riveted and mounted onto a wood frame, inaugurated in 1886. Other works include 9 sculptures for the city of Colmar between 1856-1902 (including the Grand Soutes de Monde in the front of the house) and the Lion of Belfort.<br \/>\nThe house that he was born has been the museum since 1922 and includes a reconstruction of his Paris apartment and models of the Colmar works. Note that it closes at noon. \u20ac6.50, 4.50 reduced<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nEguisheim. <\/strong>A NM \u201csmall town\u201d, the modern town surrounds the almost circular medieval town, a warren of tiny lanes and half-timbered houses.
