The southerly 1832 Canal de Charleroi carried coal and minerals from Charleroi in south Hainaut Province and joins the Canal de Willebroek at Sainctelette, which then continues to the ocean. Tour boats are available to make the trips.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>VICTOR HORTA<\/strong> (1861 Ghent -1947 Brussels)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">He was an architect mostly remembered for his daring, light-infused art nouveau buildings using trademark elements of wrought iron and glass. He trained under Alphonse Balat who designed the greenhouses in the Royal Park at Laeken, superb examples of construction work with glass, iron, and cast iron. Horta was fascinated by the architectural potential offered by these materials, which had become considerably cheaper with the advent of industrial production in the 19<sup>th<\/sup> century. Slim metal columns connected to arches or lintels were used to replace load-bearing walls both inside and outside. Staircases were often surmounted by a glass skylight that introduced light into the heart of the home. He also designed furniture to compliment the rooms to make them a total \u2018work of art.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">His once-celebrated <strong>Maison du Peuple<\/strong> was torn down in 1965 but surviving masterpieces include Rue Am\u00e9ricaine 25, now <strong>Mus<\/strong><strong>\u00e9e Horta<\/strong> and Grand Magasin Waucquez, now <strong>Centre Beige de la Bande Dessin<\/strong><strong>\u00e9e<\/strong> (the comic strip museum), along with Horta\u2019s truly art ouveau house, the 1893 <strong>H<\/strong><strong>\u00f4tel Tassel<\/strong> and his first civic commission, the charming <strong>Jardin d\u2019Enfants<\/strong> in the Marolles, which still functions as a schoolhouse.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Horta\u2019s WWI exile in England and the USA marked a transition in styles \u2013 gone was sensuous art nouveau and in its place was his clean-cut, functional interpretation of art deco. From 1922 to 1928, Horta designed the bold but severe <strong>BOZAR<\/strong>, while his last major work was the disappointing, rather drab post-art deco <strong>Bruxelles-Central train station <\/strong>(completed 1952 after his death).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">His buildings comprise one World Heritage Site.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>EAST OF BRUSSELS<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Sonian Forest<\/strong> (Foret de Soignes).

The remains were acquired in 1903 and the old priory dwelling was modified by an architect into the current chateau. In 1915, the outbuildings and a colonnaded gallery at the front were added.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Today, the complex is owned by the Belgian government and regularly used for political summits as well as for important guests of the federal government.

The architect was instructed to produce a <em>Gesamtkunstwerk<\/em> (\u201ctotal work of art\u201d). It is radically geometric with rectangular lines and a flat roof. The exterior is clad with rectangular limestone? panels that give it a very modern look. The nicest feature is the tower crowned with several copper statues. The rooflines, some of the windows, and the windows on the tower are bordered by an ornate brass\/copper molding that has tarnished copper blue where most weathered, and the exterior walls are stained by the copper.

Everything was covered in the Brussels card.<br \/>\n<\/em><strong>CATHEDRAL AREA<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Cathedrale des Sts-Michel &amp; Gudule<\/strong>. Host to coronations and royal weddings, this grand, twin-towered cathedral was begun in 1226 but took 300 years to complete. The highlights were: great stained glass, column saints, the enormous wooden pulpit by Hendrik Verbruggen (Adam and Eve driven out of Eden by skeletons), and ornately carved wood confessionals.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Centre Belge de la Bande Dessin\u00e9e.<\/strong> Housed in a Horta classic masterpiece (wrought-iron superstructure and a glass roof), the comic strip museum gave a great introduction to the production of comic strips. But these are only European comics, of which I had only heard of a few, and all the \u2018scripts\u2019 are in French. There are several displays on the building that was the main interest for me.

A large public square in the center of this area, Google Maps took me to the semi-circular end \u2013 there were two statues of Albert I (1875-1934; r.1909-34; great copper statue on a horse, died in a climbing accident) and his wife Elizabeth (1876-1965; stone statue).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Jan Mot Gallery<\/strong>.

The gable has the Star of David and the tables of the law. The sober inside is decorated with sculpted elements and the polychrome apse is adorned with many Jewish religious symbols.

About half the work was on loan to the San Francisco MoMA and replaced by paintings of Nicholas Party. Magritte was a wonderful artist and had an unconventionally conventional life.

The vast complex was destroyed in a 1731 fire and is now seen as an archaeological exhibit seeing the old foundations of the subterranean area under Place Royal. Enter the main building, and pass through the chapel, go down a medieval street (Rue Isabelle), see Aula magna (the banqueting hall) and the Museum in Hoogstraeten House. It has little atmosphere.

Housed in a 1922-28 art deco Horta masterpiece, I have never been to a museum so screwed up in its organization. The tickets are sold across the street, there are no signs directing you anywhere, the 4 exhibits all have separate tickets, the locker where you must store your pack has a coat hanger symbol on the door, not a pack (and a screwing combination system \u2013 I wonder how many people forget their locker number and personally set combination), and the labels under all the photos in \u201cResist! the 1960s Protests\u201d section are poorly done (French and Flemish in the Belgium and France ones, but English in the ones on America and South Africa and you have to search through each one to find the English). As a result, I had a real walk-about just to get to the first gallery but had a chance to see large parts of the beautiful building \u2013 for which there is not a word. Other exhibits are thousands of stuffed toys by the artist Charlemagne Palestine and some unattractive modern art.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>On day 3 in Brussels, I had a huge drive-around day to see places widely separated by distance (too far to walk to) or were closed on Monday and ended up visiting almost every part of the city.<br \/>\n<\/em><strong>De Vaartkapoen Sculpture<\/strong>.

Incongruously open at 9 most of the year, it is 10 in July and August, this museum tells the whole story of chocolate and what it means to Belgium \u2013 with much less detail than Chocolate Story in Bruges.

In a foundry owned by the Campanie des Bronzes (1854-1970), there is a room of old metalworking machines and products made of metal (printing presses, sewing machines,). This foundry also made pipelines for gas and electricity, light fixtures, and decorative items like chandeliers and gates. All is in French or Flemish and one is given an English \u201cbook\u201d that is difficult to follow and gives too much detail. Upstairs is a good WWI exhibit in English that tells the social issues of the war especially pertaining to women.

Erasmus was a famous humanist and writer who believed that one had to be familiar with ancient Greek and Roman texts and philosophers to understand the Bible and then thought it right to follow a true pastoral vacation in the spirit of Christ. He trained as a monk, was ordained in 1492, and then wrote against the excesses of monasteries, the church, and politics. He wrote Pause of Folly (1505), Adages (proverbs and quotations from classical literature) several other books, and 3000 letters, several of which he wrote to Luther.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The house is wonderful with wood floors and beamed ceilings, furniture, sculpture, paintings, and wooden statues.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Van Buuren Museum.<\/strong> In a 1928 art deco house, this exquisite museum has 5 rooms of furnishings, stained glass, and 5 centuries of art.

A few parts have survived, including Porte de Hal, one of the 7 imposing 14th-century\u00a0gatehouse towers.

Horta built this house and studio for himself in 1898, the beginning of the art nouveau movement. He extended it to the rear adding a sewing room, a dressing room, and a terrace with a winter garden. On his return from the USA in 1919, he sold both and the studio became a middle-class home. The local municipality bought the house in 1961 and opened it to the public in 1969. The studio was bought in 1963 but could not be renovated until 1989.
