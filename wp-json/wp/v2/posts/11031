It borders\u00a0Slovenia\u00a0to the northwest,\u00a0Hungary\u00a0to the northeast,\u00a0Serbia\u00a0to the east,\u00a0Bosnia and Herzegovina, and\u00a0Montenegro\u00a0to the southeast, sharing a\u00a0maritime border\u00a0with\u00a0Italy. Its capital,\u00a0Zagreb, forms one of the country&#8217;s\u00a0primary subdivisions, along with\u00a0twenty counties. Croatia has an area of 56,594 square kilometres (21,851 square miles) and a population of 4.28\u00a0million, most of whom are\u00a0Roman Catholics.<br \/>\nInhabited since the\u00a0Paleolithic Age, the\u00a0Croats\u00a0arrived in the area in the 6th century and organised the territory into two duchies by the 9th century. Croatia was first internationally recognized as an independent state on 7 June 879 during the reign of duke\u00a0Branimir.\u00a0Tomislav\u00a0became the first king by 925, elevating Croatia to the status of a\u00a0kingdom, which retained its sovereignty for nearly two centuries. During the succession crisis after the Trpimirovi\u0107 dynasty ended, Croatia\u00a0entered\u00a0a\u00a0personal union\u00a0with\u00a0Hungary\u00a0in 1102. In 1527, faced with\u00a0Ottoman conquest, the Croatian Parliament elected\u00a0Ferdinand I of Austria\u00a0to the Croatian throne. In October 1918, in the final days of\u00a0World War I, the\u00a0State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, independent from Austria-Hungary, was proclaimed in Zagreb, and in December 1918 it was\u00a0merged into\u00a0the\u00a0Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.<br \/>\nFollowing the Axis\u00a0invasion of Yugoslavia\u00a0in April 1941, most of the Croatian territory was incorporated into the\u00a0Nazi-backed client-state\u00a0which led to the development of a\u00a0resistance movement\u00a0and the creation of the\u00a0Federal State of Croatia\u00a0which after the war become a founding member and a federal constituent of the\u00a0Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On 25 June 1991, Croatia\u00a0declared independence, which came wholly into effect on 8 October of the same year. The\u00a0Croatian War of Independence\u00a0was fought successfully for four years following the declaration.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0sovereign state\u00a0of Croatia is a\u00a0republic\u00a0governed under a\u00a0parliamentary system\u00a0and a\u00a0developed country\u00a0with a\u00a0very high standard of living. It is a member of the\u00a0European Union\u00a0(EU), the\u00a0United Nations\u00a0(UN), the\u00a0Council of Europe,\u00a0NATO, the\u00a0World Trade Organization\u00a0(WTO), and a founding member of the\u00a0Union for the Mediterranean. As an active participant in the\u00a0UN peacekeeping forces, Croatia has contributed troops to the\u00a0NATO-led mission in Afghanistan\u00a0and took a non-permanent seat on the\u00a0UN Security Council\u00a0for the 2008\u20132009 term. Since 2000, the\u00a0Croatian government\u00a0has constantly invested in infrastructure, especially\u00a0transport routes and facilities\u00a0along the\u00a0Pan-European corridors.<br \/>\nCroatia&#8217;s economy\u00a0is dominated by\u00a0service\u00a0and\u00a0industrial sectors\u00a0and agriculture.\u00a0Tourism\u00a0is a significant source of revenue, with Croatia ranked among the\u00a0top 20\u00a0most popular tourist destinations in the world. The state controls a part of the economy, with substantial government expenditure. The European Union is Croatia&#8217;s most important\u00a0trading partner. Croatia provides a\u00a0social security,\u00a0universal health care\u00a0system, and a tuition-free\u00a0primary and secondary education, while supporting\u00a0culture\u00a0through numerous public institutions and corporate investments in\u00a0media\u00a0and\u00a0publishing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GEOGRAPHY<\/strong><br \/>\nCroatia is located in\u00a0Central\u00a0and Southeast Europe, on the coast of the\u00a0Adriatic Sea. It borders Hungary to the northeast,\u00a0Serbia\u00a0to the east,\u00a0Bosnia and Herzegovina\u00a0and\u00a0Montenegro\u00a0to the southeast, and\u00a0Slovenia\u00a0to the northwest. Part of the territory in the extreme south surrounding\u00a0Dubrovnik\u00a0is a\u00a0practical exclave\u00a0connected to the rest of the mainland by\u00a0territorial waters, but separated on land by a short coastline strip belonging to Bosnia and Herzegovina around\u00a0Neum.<br \/>\nThe territory covers 56,594 square kilometres (21,851 square miles), consisting of 56,414 square kilometres (21,782 square miles) of land and 128 square kilometres (49 square miles) of water. It is the 127th largest country in the world.<br \/>\nElevation ranges from the mountains of the\u00a0Dinaric Alps\u00a0with the highest point of the\u00a0Dinara\u00a0peak at 1,831 metres (6,007 feet) near the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina in the south\u00a0to the shore of the Adriatic Sea which makes up its entire southwest border. Insular Croatia consists of over\u00a0a thousand islands and islets\u00a0varying in size, 48 of which are\u00a0permanently inhabited. The largest islands are\u00a0Cres\u00a0and\u00a0Krk,\u00a0each of them having an area of around 405 square kilometres (156 square miles).<br \/>\nThe hilly northern parts of\u00a0Hrvatsko Zagorje\u00a0and the flat plains of Slavonia in the east which is part of the\u00a0Pannonian Basin\u00a0are traversed by major rivers such as\u00a0Danube,\u00a0Drava,\u00a0Kupa, and\u00a0Sava. The Danube, Europe&#8217;s second longest river, runs through the city of\u00a0Vukovar\u00a0in the extreme east and forms part of the border with\u00a0Vojvodina. The central and southern regions near the Adriatic coastline and islands consist of low mountains and forested highlands.<br \/>\nNatural resources found in the country in quantities significant enough for production include oil, coal, bauxite, low-grade iron ore, calcium, gypsum, natural asphalt, silica, mica, clays, salt, and hydropower.\u00a0Karst topography\u00a0makes up about half of Croatia and is especially prominent in the Dinaric Alps.\u00a0There are\u00a0a number of deep caves in Croatia, 49 of which are deeper than 250\u00a0m (820.21\u00a0ft), 14 of them deeper than 500\u00a0m (1,640.42\u00a0ft) and three deeper than 1,000\u00a0m (3,280.84\u00a0ft). Croatia&#8217;s most famous lakes are the\u00a0Plitvice lakes, a system of 16 lakes with waterfalls connecting them over\u00a0dolomite and\u00a0limestone\u00a0cascades. The lakes are renowned for their distinctive colours, ranging from turquoise to mint green, grey or blue.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ECONOMY<\/strong><br \/>\nCroatia is classified as a high-income economy by the United Nations.\u00a0International Monetary Fund\u00a0data projects that Croatian\u00a0nominal GDP\u00a0stands at $54.758 billion, or $13,271 per capita for 2017, while\u00a0purchasing power parity\u00a0GDP stands at $102.113 billion, or $24,748 per capita.\u00a0According to\u00a0Eurostat, Croatian PPS GDP per capita stood at 62% of the EU average in 2017.<br \/>\nReal GDP growth in 2007 was 6.0 per cent.\u00a0The average net salary of a Croatian worker in January 2017 was 5,895\u00a0HRK\u00a0per month (roughly 800 EUR), and the average gross salary was 7,911 HRK per month.<br \/>\nAs of December\u00a02018, the unemployment rate dropped to 9.6% from 12.2% in December 2017. The number of unemployed persons was 148.919 thousand. Unemployment Rate in Croatia in years 1996-2018 averaged 17.38%, reaching an all-time high of 23.60% in January 2002 and a record low of 8.40% in September 2018.<br \/>\nIn 2010, economic output was dominated by the\u00a0service sector\u00a0which accounted for 66% of GDP, followed by the\u00a0industrial sector\u00a0with 27.2% and agriculture accounting for 6.8% of GDP.\u00a0According to 2004 data, 2.7% of the workforce were employed in agriculture, 32.8% by industry and 64.5% in services.\u00a0The industrial sector is dominated by shipbuilding, food processing, pharmaceuticals, information technology, biochemical and timber industry. In 2010, Croatian exports were valued at 64.9\u00a0billion kuna (\u20ac8.65\u00a0billion) with 110.3\u00a0billion kuna (\u20ac14.7\u00a0billion) worth of imports. The largest\u00a0trading partner\u00a0is the rest of the European Union.\u00a0More than half of Croatia&#8217;s trade is with other European Union member states.<br \/>\nPrivatization\u00a0and the drive toward a\u00a0market economy\u00a0had barely begun under the new Croatian Government when war broke out in 1991. As a result of the war, the economic infrastructure sustained massive damage, particularly the revenue-rich tourism industry. From 1989 to 1993, the GDP fell 40.5%. The Croatian state still controls a significant part of the economy, with government expenditures accounting for as much as 40% of GDP. A backlogged judiciary system, combined with inefficient\u00a0public administration, especially on issues of land ownership and corruption, are particular concerns. In the 2018\u00a0Corruption Perceptions Index, published by\u00a0Transparency International, the country is ranked 60th with a score of 48, where zero denotes &#8220;highly corrupt&#8221; and 100 &#8220;very clean&#8221;.\u00a0In June 2013, the national debt stood at 59.5% of the nation&#8217;s GDP.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TOURISM<br \/>\n<\/strong>Tourism\u00a0dominates the Croatian service sector and accounts for up to 20% of Croatian GDP. Annual tourist industry income for 2017 was estimated at \u20ac9.5\u00a0billion.\u00a0Its positive effects are felt throughout the economy of Croatia in terms of increased business volume observed in retail business, processing industry orders and summer seasonal employment. The industry is considered an export business, because it significantly reduces the country&#8217;s external trade imbalance.\u00a0Since the end of the Croatian War of Independence, the tourist industry has grown rapidly, recording a fourfold rise in tourist numbers, with more than 11\u00a0million tourists each year.\u00a0The most numerous\u00a0are tourists from Germany, Slovenia, Austria, Italy, and Poland as well as Croatia itself.\u00a0Length of a tourist stay in Croatia averaged 4.9 days in 2011.<br \/>\nThe bulk of the tourist industry is concentrated along the Adriatic Sea coast.\u00a0Opatija\u00a0was the first holiday resort. It first became popular in the middle of the 19th century. By the 1890s, it had become one of the most significant European health resorts.\u00a0Later a number of resorts sprang up along the coast and islands, offering services catering to both\u00a0mass tourism\u00a0and various niche markets. The most significant are\u00a0nautical tourism, as there are numerous marinas with more than 16\u00a0thousand berths,\u00a0cultural tourism\u00a0relying on appeal of medieval coastal cities and numerous cultural events taking place during the summer. Inland areas offer\u00a0agrotourism,\u00a0mountain resorts, and\u00a0spas. Zagreb is also a significant tourist destination, rivalling major coastal cities and resorts.<br \/>\nCroatia has unpolluted marine areas reflected through numerous nature reserves and 116\u00a0Blue Flag beaches.\u00a0Croatia is ranked as the 18th most popular tourist destination in the world.\u00a0About 15% of these visitors, or over one million per year, are involved with\u00a0naturism, an industry for which Croatia is world-famous. It was also the first European country to develop commercial naturist resorts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DEMOGRAPHY<br \/>\n<\/strong>With its estimated population of 4.19\u00a0million in 2016, Croatia\u00a0ranks 125th by population\u00a0in the world. Its\u00a0population density\u00a0stands at 75.9 inhabitants per square kilometre. The overall\u00a0life expectancy in Croatia\u00a0at birth was 78.20 years in 2016. The\u00a0total fertility rate\u00a0of 1.43 children per mother, is one of the\u00a0lowest in the world. Since 1991, Croatia&#8217;s\u00a0death rate\u00a0has continuously exceeded its\u00a0birth rate.\u00a0Since the late 1990s, there has been a positive net migration into Croatia, reaching a level of more than 7,000 net immigrants in 2006.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Croatian Bureau of Statistics\u00a0forecast that the population may shrink to 3.1\u00a0million by 2051, depending on actual birth rate and the level of net migration.\u00a0The population of Croatia rose steadily from 2.1\u00a0million in 1857 until 1991, when it peaked at 4.7\u00a0million, with exception of censuses taken in 1921 and 1948, i.e. following two world wars.\u00a0The natural growth rate of the population is currently negative\u00a0with the\u00a0demographic transition\u00a0completed in the 1970s.\u00a0In recent years, the Croatian government has been pressured each year to add 40% to work permit quotas for foreign workers.\u00a0In accordance with its immigration policy, Croatia is trying to entice emigrants to return.<br \/>\nThe population decrease was also a result of the Croatian War of Independence. During the war, large sections of the population were displaced and emigration increased. In 1991, in predominantly occupied areas, more than 400,000 Croats were either removed from their homes by the Croatian Serb forces or fled the violence.\u00a0During the final days of the war in 1995, more than 100,000 Serbs voluntarily fled the country before the arrival of Croatian forces during\u00a0Operation Storm\u00a0to avoid being brought to justice for their unjustifiable acts committed during the Croatian War for Independence.\u00a0After the war, the number of displaced persons fell to about 250,000. The Croatian government has taken care of displaced persons by the social security system, and since December 1991 through the Office of Displaced Persons and Refugees.<br \/>\nMost of the territories which were abandoned during the Croatian War of Independence were settled by Croat refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina, mostly from north-western Bosnia, while some of the displaced people returned to their homes.<br \/>\nAccording to the 2013 United Nations report, 17.6% of Croatia&#8217;s population were foreign-born immigrants.\u00a0Croatia is inhabited mostly by Croats (90.4%) and is ethnically the most\u00a0homogeneous\u00a0of the six countries of former Yugoslavia. Minority groups include Serbs (4.4%),\u00a0Bosniaks,\u00a0Italians,\u00a0Albanians,\u00a0Roma,\u00a0Hungarians,\u00a0Slovenes,\u00a0Czechs,\u00a0Montenegrins,\u00a0Macedonians,\u00a0Yugoslavs, and others (1.98%).<br \/>\n<strong>Religion<\/strong>. Croatia has no official religion.\u00a0Freedom of religion\u00a0is a right defined by the Constitution which also defines all\u00a0religious communities\u00a0as\u00a0equal before the law and separated from the state.<br \/>\nAccording to the 2011 census, 91.36% of Croatians identify as Christian; of these, Roman Catholics make up the largest group, accounting for 86.28% of the population, after which follows\u00a0Eastern Orthodoxy\u00a0(4.44%),\u00a0Protestantism\u00a0(0.34%) and other Christian (0.30%). The largest religion after Christianity is\u00a0Islam\u00a0(1.47%). 4.57% of the population describe themselves as non-religious.<br \/>\nIn the\u00a0Eurostat\u00a0Eurobarometer Poll of 2005, 67% of the population of Croatia responded that &#8220;they believe there is a God&#8221;.\u00a0In a 2009 Gallup poll, 70% answered yes to the question &#8220;Is religion an important part of your daily life?&#8221;. However, only 24% of the population attends religious services regularly.<br \/>\n<strong>Languages.<br \/>\n<\/strong>Croatian\u00a0is the official language spoken by 95.6% of citizens. Minority languages Czech,\u00a0Hungarian,\u00a0Italian,\u00a0Ruthenian,\u00a0Serbian, and\u00a0Slovak.<br \/>\nAccording to the 2011 Census, of Croatia declared Croatian as their native language, 1.2% declared Serbian as their native language, while no other language is represented in Croatia by more than 0.5% of native speakers among population of Croatia. Croatian is a member of the\u00a0South Slavic languages\u00a0of\u00a0Slavic languages\u00a0group, and is written using the Latin alphabet. There are three major\u00a0dialects\u00a0spoken on the territory of Croatia, with standard Croatian based on the\u00a0Shtokavian dialect. The\u00a0Chakavian\u00a0and\u00a0Kajkavian dialects are distinguished by their\u00a0lexicon,\u00a0phonology, and\u00a0syntax. Croatian replaced\u00a0Latin\u00a0as the official language of the Croatian government in the 19th century.\u00a0In\u00a0Yugoslavia, from 1972 to 1989, the language was constitutionally designated as &#8220;Croatian literary language&#8221;. It was the result of the resistance to &#8220;Serbo-Croatian&#8221; in the form of a\u00a0Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language\u00a0and\u00a0Croatian Spring.\u00a0Croatians are protective of their Croatian language from foreign influences and are known for\u00a0Croatian linguistic purism, as the language was under constant change and threats imposed by previous rulers (i.e. Austrian German, Hungarian, Italian, and Turkish words were changed and altered to Slavic looking or sounding ones).<br \/>\nA 2011 survey revealed that 78% of Croatians claim knowledge of at least one foreign language. According to a survey ordered by the\u00a0European Commission\u00a0in 2005, 49% of Croatians speak\u00a0English\u00a0as the second language, 34% speak\u00a0German, 14% speak\u00a0Italian, and 10% speak\u00a0French. Russian is spoken by 4% each, and 2% of Croatians speak Spanish. However, there are large municipalities\u00a0that have minority languages\u00a0that include substantial populations that speak these languages. An odd-majority of Slovenes (59%) have a certain level of knowledge of Croatian.\u00a0The country is a part of various language-based international associations most notably the\u00a0European Union Language Association.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Croatia, officially the\u00a0Republic of Croatia\u00a0(Croatian:\u00a0Republika Hrvatska) is a country at the crossroads of\u00a0Central\u00a0and\u00a0Southeast Europe, on the\u00a0Adriatic Sea.
