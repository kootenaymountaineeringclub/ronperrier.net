Socotra is 78 miles long and 28 miles north to south. It\u2018s mainly a limestone plateau with karst topography, surrounded by narrow coastal plains. Gorgeous white sand beaches, rise to the Hajhir Mountains. (1,500 metres).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Due to its remarkable biodiversity, with over a third of the local plant species found nowhere else, Socotra has been designated a\u00a0UNESCO World Heritage Site. With over 40,000 inhabitants, though, it\u2019s not just a nature reserve.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The island is new to tourism, so this is not a luxurious vacation. The best accommodation is camping on the beaches. <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">One can only go to Socrata by tour. The company arranges the visa, books the difficult-to-arrange flight from Abu Dhabi and arranges for a local jobber to conduct the tour.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Socotra is considered the jewel of biodiversity in the Arabian Sea. Described as the Most Alien-looking Place on Earth or the Arabian Sea\u2019s Galapagos, Socotra is a naturalists\u2019 haven,<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A third of the 700 flora species are endemic. The long geological isolation and its fierce heat and drought have combined to create a \u2018unique and spectacular endemic flora, most not found anywhere else in the world.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The endemic fauna includes six species of birds &#8211; the Socotra starling and sunbird. There\u2019s only one endemic mammal (a bat), but 31 endemic reptiles (skinks, legless lizards, and one chameleon). The plants are endangered by non-native goats and the birds by non-native feral cats. There are over 120 species of birds and about 190 species of butterflies. There is so much beauty all around the island.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br \/>\nThe interior of the island is dominated by the beautiful and green Hagghier mountains and limestone plateau. This is the richest area for endemic plant species. Other endemics are found throughout the island in every type of vegetation. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">One of the most famous plants is the dragon\u2019s blood tree \u201cdracaena cinnabara\u201d which exists only on Socotra and nowhere else on the Earth. The tree&#8217;s name comes from the dark red liquid sap that oozes out. <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Desert Rose (adenium obesium) looks like a blooming elephant leg. The strange and rare Cucumber Tree is common at higher elevations.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Day 1<\/span> Flight\u00a0AUH-SCT @08:55-10:20<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I was surprised at the rugged mountains above Hadibo.

Dragon\u2019s Blood Trees became more common as we climbed.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">We stopped at a village and walked about \u00bd hour down a limestone wadi with pools to a large natural pool, <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">almost an infinity pool with a great view of the ocean far below.

A creek with a small waterfall falls onto the sand for a nice rinse. A large, covered cistern of water was next to the road. Next to the beach is a 100+ metre dune and next to it another 170 m sand dune, the largest in Socrata. Both dunes climb the high, steep limestone cliff.

The inner canyon is spectacular with dazzling white 10-metre walls. The water in the 100-metre-long pool was quite cool for a very refreshing swim. Our guide jumped from a 10 m cliff.
