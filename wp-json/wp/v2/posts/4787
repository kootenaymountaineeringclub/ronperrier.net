All year round they are home to much smaller animals that form vast reefs: corals. Intricate pink structures stand out amid contortions of vegetable-green ones; dark-striped fish flit among them and turtles hover above. Corals lay down limestone skeletons of different shapes and sizes: branching types like small trees; ground-huggers spreading squat.<\/p>\n<p>The colours that lure snorkelling and scuba-driving tourists are produced bysingle-celled algae that grow symbiotically in corals\u2019 tissue. These use carbon dioxide respired by their host to make oxygen and carbohydrates through photosynthesis, giving corals most of the energy they need to form their skeletons. But this delicate balance is threatened by humans, both in the short term and over the coming years.<\/p>\n<p>Overfishing, tourism and pollution are the most immediate perils, disrupting reefs\u2019 ecosystems and the ability of corals\u2019 algae to photosynthesis. In the longer term, rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will hit reefs in two ways. Oceans absorb about 30% of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere, which makes them more acidic; as concentrations of carbon dioxide in the water rise, it will be harder for coral skeletons to calcify. And as oceans warm, corals will lose their colourful algae, which can only cope within a narrow range of temperatures. Reefs will be reduced to bleached-looking skeletons, vulnerable to disease.<\/p>\n<p>Only twice before has such bleaching occurred worldwide. The first time coincided with El Ni\u00f1o in 1997-98, the world\u2019s largest climatic phenomenon, which causes surface temperatures to soar in the Pacific Ocean. The second was in 2010. A third is now under way. About 16% of corals died in the 1997-98 disaster. The current bleaching event, once more occurring alongside a Ni\u00f1o, may have affected 38% of the world\u2019s corals. Conditions now may offer a foretaste of the damage climate change could wreak on these already vulnerable ecosystems.<br \/>\nMore than 2\/3 of the corals in the Great Barrier Reef in its northern region have been lost in the first nine months of 2016 because of bleaching caused by warmer weather.<\/p>\n<p>Coral reefs are found from the Middle East to Australia and America. They cover less than 0.1% of the ocean floor. But their importance is far greater than that figure suggests. They protect 150,000km (93,000 miles) of shoreline in more than 100 countries and territories by acting as coastal buffers, enduring the brunt of high waves and rough weather. They also support perhaps a quarter of all marine species, and act as nurseries for many others. In South-East Asian waters, the richest reefs are in the \u201ccoral triangle\u201d (see map). This area of 86,500 square km holds two-thirds of the world\u2019s coral species and more than 3,000 species of reef fish\u2014twice as many as are found anywhere else.<\/p>\n<p><strong>More fish to fry<\/strong><br \/>\nIn the past half-century, though, these beautiful, biodiverse structures have been put under pressure by human activity. About a quarter of all coral cover has died. The reefs that are in worst shape are those off the most crowded beaches. \u201cPeople don\u2019t leave enough time for their sun cream to soak in, so it gets in the water,\u201d says one deckhand with Eo Wai\u2019anae Tours, which organises boat trips off Oahu.<br \/>\nMore damage is caused by fertiliser-rich run-off from farms, leading to algal blooms which block light the corals need. Fishing near reefs cuts the number of herbivorous fish, allowing vegetation to grow out of control. Some fishing methods are particularly harmful: for example, blast fishermen in Colombia, Tanzania and elsewhere use dynamite to stun and kill fish without regard to the harm done to nearby reefs.<\/p>\n<p>Crown-of-thorns starfish, coral-chompers that have proliferated in some areas, including Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef, add to the stress. In the South China Seaisland-building and fishing for giant clams are crushing some reefs beyond the possibility of recovery (see article). The World Resources Institute, a think-tank, estimates that about 60% of reefs face such immediate threats.<\/p>\n<p>The bounty that reefs provide accrues to those living near them, and in the short term. Without strong property rights, the result is an unfolding tragedy of the commons, in which fishermen and tour operators destroy the resources they rely on.<\/p>\n<p>Tourism generated by the Great Barrier Reef is worth about $4.6 billion annually to nearby Queensland alone. Australian bigwigs bent over backwards last year to keep the UN from listing the reef, a World Heritage Site, as \u201cin danger\u201d. Estimates suggest that the economic value of Martinique and Saint Lucia\u2019s corals comes to $50,000 per square km each year, thanks largely to tourism. But overdevelopment threatens the reefs the visitors come to gawp at. Sediment from construction clouds waters, burying corals and blocking the light they need. Hotels close to the shore may be convenient for tourists, but the process of building them can kill the reefs that snorkelers like to swim over.<\/p>\n<p>The mix of problems varies from place to place, meaning policies must be locally tailored to tackle them. But even when governments and environmentalists focus on the long term, the need to limit fishing means they often struggle to craft policies that do not cause immediate harm to poor people. The three countries with the largest numbers of people who fish on reefs are all in the coral-triangle region: Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the Philippines. In Indonesia and in the Philippines, up to 1m people\u2019s livelihoods depend on reefs.<br \/>\nAverting a tragedy of the commons means agreeing which activities should be restricted and enforcing the rules. For coral reefs\u2014and other biodiverse marine environments\u2014the usual approach is to give ecologically sensitive areas special status under local or regional laws. In such \u201cmarine protected areas\u201d (MPAs), activities that are deemed harmful, such as fishing, drilling and mining, can then be restricted or banned, with penalties for rule-breakers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Command and conquer<\/strong><br \/>\nThe Aichi targets, agreed in 2010 under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, seek to reduce \u201canthropogenic pressures\u201d on coral reefs to \u201cmaintain their integrity and function\u201d. The aim is to have at least 17% of inland water and 10% of coastal and marine areas under conservation by 2020. Most countries have signed up. But the targets are far from being met. Less than 3% of the ocean\u2019s surface is within an MPA.<br \/>\nThe most urgent action is needed close to shore. The nearer humans are to reefs, the worse their effect on the fragile ecosystems. A global register of fishing vessels, long under discussion, would also help identify wrongdoers. And beefing up the UN law of the sea could inspire further action. Decades old, it has little to say about biodiversity.<\/p>\n<p>But simply declaring an area protected does not make it so. In 2009 George Bush junior, then president of America, established three national marine monuments in the Pacific, including nearly 518,000 square km of coral islands and surrounding areas. Their remoteness makes it hard to stop vessels entering illegally; Hawaii\u2019s coastguard is already stretched.<\/p>\n<p>Satellites are sometimes used to police MPAs, but they pass over infrequently. In the future, sailing robots could play a larger role. America\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has been working with a private firm, Saildrone, on hardy models equipped with carbon-fibre fins. They cost less than $500,000 each and can roam remote ocean regions for months, making them far cheaper than manned boats.<\/p>\n<p>Such drones could photograph rogue fishing vessels, obtaining hard-to-gather evidence for any criminal proceedings. And they could carry out other useful work at the same time, such as monitoring ocean temperature and acidity or tracking tagged members of endangered species. Saildrone plans to provide its robots as a service, so that universities and other cash-strapped organisations do not have to buy one outright.<\/p>\n<p>Richer countries are better able both to administer and to enforce MPAs. Three-quarters of coral reefs in Australian waters are in MPAs, but only 16% of those within the coral triangle. \u201cIt is difficult to ensure systematic monitoring,\u201d says Rusty Brainard of NOAA, who has advised marine scientists in the region. Indonesia has more than 17,500 islands, he points out.<\/p>\n<p>In poor parts of the world, low-tech methods of surveillance are needed. Just 0.09% of Malaysia\u2019s territorial waters, and those within its exclusive economic zone, are protected by an MPA. But a national programme requires fishermen to paint their vessels according to how far out they have permission to fish within the nearshore area. Other fishermen can then spot when a rogue vessel has strayed, even if they cannot read. And as boats require regular painting anyway, little extra cost falls on their owners.<\/p>\n<p>Public-private partnerships could also help. A pilot project in Barbados, supported in part by local hoteliers and tourism organisations, will charge visitors to enter a coastal MPA managed by Blue Finance, an alternative-investment outfit with support from the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). About $1m was needed to set up the area; its upkeep will require half that each year. \u201cWe find private investors who don\u2019t mind if their returns are a little below market rates because they are benefiting Barbados,\u201d says Nicolas Pascal, an environmental economist who directs the company.<br \/>\nOther pilots are under way in Colombia and Martinique. But more backers are needed. According to research conducted under the Convention on Biological Diversity, investment will need to quintuple for the Aichi targets and other conservation goals to be met.<br \/>\nThe effectiveness of marine reserves is hard to measure. Reefs are complex, ancient systems, and the effects of better policies will become known only gradually. \u201cYou can\u2019t manage ecosystems: you can only manage the impact of humans upon them,\u201d says Jerker Tamelander, the head of the reef unit at UNEP.<\/p>\n<p>Even if the right policies are adopted to keep corals healthy in the immediate future, longer-term threats loom. Neither oceanic warming nor acidification can be kept out by an MPA. And both may be happening too fast for corals to adapt, especially as recent global climate deals will not slow them much. Back slaps and handshakes accompanied the inclusion of an aim to limit global warming to just 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels in the Paris Agreement last year. But only an incorrigible optimist would bet on that aim being achieved. And even if it is, that much warming could breach the environmental limits within which most reefs can thrive.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Nurture, not nature<\/strong><br \/>\nSo researchers are turning their attention to ways to help corals cope. Their global diversity, scientists hope, may hold the key. The same coral will grow differently under different conditions: corals of the western Pacific near Indonesia, for example, can withstand higher temperatures than the same species in the eastern Pacific near Hawaii. Such disparities can be found even quite locally. In Kane\u2019ohe Bay, where the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology lies, 70% of some reef patches has been bleached in the current event. Others, less than 200 metres away, suffered bleaching to just 40% of their corals.<\/p>\n<p>The characteristics that help some reefs survive unusual conditions could allow others to endure climate change. But tough corals from one place cannot simply be transplanted to another. So a team at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology is in the early stages of engineering reef ecosystems, with $4m from the Paul G. Allen Foundation, a charity set up by Bill Gates\u2019s former business partner.<\/p>\n<p>Organisms respond to environmental changes through both genetic processes (adaptation) and non-genetic ones (acclimatisation). With corals, the nature of their symbiotic relationships can also alter. So selectively breeding and conditioning them, and investigating whether certain types of algae confer resistance to heat or acidity, could create hardier varieties faster than they would develop naturally.<\/p>\n<p>These could then be used to repopulate ravaged reefs\u2014once more is known about how and where to transplant them. \u201cWe\u2019re assisting evolution,\u201d explains Ruth Gates, who leads the research. Her team aims to help corals withstand changing ocean temperature and chemistry. Despite all her effort, she says: \u201cif the tools we develop are never used, I would be the happiest person in the world.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>ASIA&#8217;S CORAL FACES a DEADLY ONSLAUGHT\u00a0<\/strong><br \/>\nIf overfishing and pollution don\u2019t kill it, climate change will<br \/>\n<time class=\"blog-post__datetime\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\" datetime=\"2019-10-24T14:55:50Z\">Oct 24th 2019<\/time><span class=\"blog-post__location-created\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\">| ECONOMIST<\/p>\n<p><\/span>Small boats criss-cross Black Rock Reef on their way to nearby seaweed and pearl farms. Below, the blue lips of giant clams open and close amid a jungle of multicoloured coral. At the sound of a distant detonation\u2014dynamite fishing, although illegal, is common in the area\u2014a small shark swims hurriedly away. The reef lies nestled off the town of Taytay, on the island of Palawan in the Philippines. Its vivid blues, pinks and greens are a welcome sight given how many nearby corals died because of unusually warm water almost a decade ago\u2014a blight that is becoming commonplace because of global warming.<\/p>\n<div class=\"blog-post__inner\">\n<div class=\"blog-post__text\">\n<p>The outlook for coral is dire. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a\u00a0<small>un<\/small>\u00a0body, predicted last month that a rise in global temperatures of 1.5\u00baC relative to pre-industrial times would probably kill 70-90% of the world\u2019s coral reefs. Given that the planet has already warmed by about 1\u00baC, the countdown for corals has begun. But the diversity of coral species and the variety of habitats in which they thrive mean that they will not disappear in a uniform way. Understanding why reefs like Black Rock survive and recover from overheating is essential to conservation efforts.<\/p>\n<figure role=\"presentation\"><\/figure>\n<p>Black Rock lies in the Coral Triangle, 6m square kilometres of water in the heart of South-East Asia that is home to perhaps half of the world\u2019s coral reefs (see map). The Triangle\u2019s waters teem with an abundance of life almost unmatched elsewhere on the planet. More than 130m people depend on it for their food and livelihood. The reefs support myriad marine species, and provide a spawning ground for the largest tuna fishery in the world. According to a study involving the United Nations Environment Programme, economic benefits from the Coral Triangle were worth $13.9bn in 2017. Tourism generated 45% of that, and commercial fishing 42%. The rest came from coastal development, which reefs help to protect by acting as buffers against rough seas.<\/p>\n<p>Coral consists of symbiotic communities of algae and tiny animals called polyps. The polyps give the coral its structure. This provides shelter to algae; they in turn generate sugars on which the polyps feed. When temperatures rise, the polyps expel the algae, causing coral to lose its colour and die\u2014a process known as bleaching. Temperature is not the only critical variable: corals are also sensitive to factors such as light levels, dissolved chemicals and changing currents.<\/p>\n<p>These sensitivities explain why corals are so vulnerable. In addition to climate change, local stresses still abound. \u201cIt\u2019s not about managing the reefs, it\u2019s about managing the people,\u201d says Peter Mumby of the University of Queensland in Australia. In the Philippines some 40m of them live within 30km of a coral reef. Overfishing disrupts reefs\u2019 ecosystems. Coastal construction can lead to the dumping of sediment in the ocean, clouding waters and blocking needed light. Mavic Matillano, who works in the Philippines for\u00a0<small>wwf<\/small>, a conservation group, worries particularly about how reefs are being affected by road-widening and other construction on Palawan. Run-off from fertilisers and untreated sewage are other nasty problems with which corals must contend.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, the world\u2019s oceans are warming. They have absorbed more than 90% of the extra heat produced by humans in recent decades. Between 1985 and 2006 the waters of the Coral Triangle warmed at a rate of 0.2\u00baC per decade. That might not sound like much, but as a rule of thumb reefs bleach when the temperature of the surrounding waters rises 1\u00baC above the historical norm for four or more weeks, turning colourful corals into ghostly forests.<\/p>\n<p>The most recent global spate of bleaching, in 2014-17, affected perhaps 70% of coral reefs, according to America\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It was particularly severe because it coincided in part with El Ni\u00f1o, a periodic climate pattern that warms equatorial waters in the Pacific every few years. Even reefs that had not experienced any recent extensive bleaching, such as the northernmost areas of Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef, suffered badly. Severe bleaching is now occurring too frequently for reefs to recover fully. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how well the biology can continue to be culled and then bounce back,\u201d explains Gregory Asner of Arizona State University. By the middle of the century bleaching may occur every year.<\/p>\n<p>Climate change threatens reefs in other ways, too. The oceans have absorbed about 30% of the increased flows of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, becoming less alkaline as they do so. This sets in motion chemical reactions that make it harder for the corals to build their exoskeletons. More intense tropical storms, meanwhile, could see reefs more frequently smashed; rising sea levels could see them drowned.<\/p>\n<p>Scientists, politicians and activists are trying to tackle both the short-term and long-term threats which corals face. The thinking is that the local environment makes a difference: corals that face fewer local threats may have a better shot at surviving larger changes to their environment. It helps that the number of marine protected areas (<small>mpa<\/small>s) around the world is on the rise. Research suggests that coral cover increases in older, well-enforced\u00a0<small>mpa<\/small>s in isolated areas.\u00a0<small>mpa<\/small>s now encompass 8% of the ocean, up from less than 1% two decades ago.<\/p>\n<p>Much of the increase is a result of America, France and Britain safeguarding areas around their overseas territories. Countries such as the Cook Islands in the South Pacific Ocean have protected their entire national waters. The Coral Triangle Initiative, an alliance of the six countries in the area, has also promoted\u00a0<small>mpa<\/small>s. Yet only a tiny share of its members\u2019 waters is shielded. The cost and complexity of patrolling\u00a0<small>mpa<\/small>s remain a huge challenge.<\/p>\n<p>In the Philippines a change to the law more than two decades ago transferred control of coastal waters up to 15km offshore to municipal governments. It gives local communities a greater say in how to manage marine resources. Ms Matillano says that talking to mayors and other local officials about the business case for protecting reefs works well, as does including locals in the teams which enforce such protection. She adds that some 155\u00a0<small>mpa<\/small>s exist off Palawan, though not all are effective. Wilfredo Licuanan of De La Salle University in Manila, who studies Palawan\u2019s reefs, also estimates that only a tiny fraction of coastal towns hire a marine biologist for guidance. He gives talks in shopping malls and at public events to educate Filipinos about the plight of their corals.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile scientists are racing to discover why some types of coral have recovered from recent bleaching events better than others. The answers may involve adaptation (genetic processes) as well as acclimatisation (non-genetic ones). The intricate work requires data that can be difficult to obtain from areas which lack adequate monitoring. There are big knowledge gaps when it comes to the Coral Triangle, for example.<\/p>\n<p>Teams in America are looking into selectively breeding and conditioning corals, and expensive coral \u201cgardening\u201d occurs in places that can afford it. This involves transplanting corals to reefs in need, often by placing them on man-made underwater structures on which they can grow. In one area near Taytay, corals cling to sturdy metal frames, and a garden for giant clams has been established.<\/p>\n<p>Another way forward could be to identify the most resilient sorts of coral in spots that are most sheltered from changing ocean temperatures and other human harm. That could allow more careful targeting of resources. Work published last year in\u00a0<em>Conservation Letters<\/em>\u00a0by a team led by Hawthorne Beyer of the University of Queensland finds that reefs in parts of the Philippines and Indonesia and off eastern Australia, among other places, may face a less severe threat than those in Hawaii and off western Australia. That is a small spot of good news for Black Rock Reef.\u00a0<span data-ornament=\"ufinish\">\u25a0<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Rejuvenating reefs &#8211; Though pollution and overuse are damaging corals, their biodiversity offers hope for their future Feb 13th 2016 Economist THE waters off the Hawaiian island of Oahu are visited each winter by migrating marine mammals such as humpback &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2016\/03\/21\/rejuvenating-coral-reefs\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-4787","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-uncategorized"],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p2Ncip-1fd","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4787","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4787"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4787\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4787"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4787"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4787"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
