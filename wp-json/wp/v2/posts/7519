The trail is not cut out often, but it is worth going up the trail bed at least 2.5km. The trail has been blasted right out of the canyon. The canyon is spectacular, as much as Hamill Creek or Fry Creek Canyons.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">In the early days, the rail provided a route to gold properties at the head of Hall Creek and also connected with the trail down Healy Creek to near Gerrard. Considerable work went into the trail as, at one time, it was 1 to 1.5m wide.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">With difficulty, one may continue farther up the valley. The difficulty may be moderate to difficult depending on how much windfall has occurred since 1989.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">From the same trailhead location, a short trail meanders down to Coot Lake. The lake is small but usually ducks and sometimes osprey can be spotted. The trail beside the lake is part of the old trail system that once stretched from Duncan Lake or Healy Landing north up the Duncan River to the Westfall River and on up the Duncan to Houston Creek. Mainly used by trappers and prospectors, it is now replaced by the Duncan Lake Forest Road.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This trail is often not maintained, but because of its scenic potential and history, it should be mentioned.
