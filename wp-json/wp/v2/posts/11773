This convent is Le Corbusier\u201d final building (opened in 1961) completed in Europe, and is also thought by many to be his most important. It was build to be a self-contained world for a community of silent monks. To achieve this lifestyle, the monastery is made of 100 individual cells, a communal library, a refectory, a rooftop cloister, a church and classrooms. Each of the hundred cells has an outward facing balcony with communal areas underneath and the cloister running around the roof.<br \/>\nThe church is a concrete box using \u201clight cannons\u201d with 5 different types of openings letting in daylight<br \/>\nThe five key elements of his modernist design are: pilotis, or load bearing columns that line the inside walls and open the fa\u00e7ade to long strip windows, grass rooftops; undulating glass surfaces on three of the four exterior surfaces; structural reinforced concrete.<br \/>\nToday if functions as a meeting place for different disciplines connected to the human sciences and philosophy. It still functions for a reduced population of friars. It something of a pilgrimage site for students of architecture. Overnight stays in unused cells are possible.<br \/>\nThis convent is a Corbusier design consisting of 4 perimeter heavy rectangular buildings joined by ramps and creating a closed interior space. This is not a typical patio but is divided into four parts by the two vertical corridors joining each other in the shape of a cross. The oddest is a large reinforced concrete box with a very narrow slit of windows about \u2153 of the way up (the church). The second is all windows facing south. The third appears to be the dormitory with 2-stories of small rooms with balconies on a rectangular base. \u20ac8<br \/>\nIt is about 25kms west of Lyon.<br \/>\nIt is part of the WHS (2017) &#8211; The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier, an Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Movement<\/p>\n<p><strong>LYON\/VILLEURBANE <\/strong>(pop Lyon 513,000)<br \/>\nLyon is the\u00a0third-largest city\u00a0and\u00a0second-largest urban area\u00a0of\u00a0France. It is located in the country&#8217;s east-central part at the confluence of the rivers Rh\u00f4ne and Sa\u00f4ne about 470\u00a0km south of\u00a0Paris, 320\u00a0kms north of\u00a0Marseille\u00a0and 56\u00a0kms NE of\u00a0Saint-\u00c9tienne. Inhabitants of the city are called\u00a0Lyonnais.<br \/>\nThe Lyon metropolitan area had a population of 2,265,375 in 2014.\u00a0The city is known for its\u00a0cuisine\u00a0and\u00a0gastronomy, and historical and architectural landmarks; part of it is a registered as a\u00a0UNESCO\u00a0World Heritage site. Lyon was historically an important area for the production and weaving of silk. Lyon played a significant role in the\u00a0history of cinema: it is where\u00a0Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re\u00a0invented the\u00a0cinematograph. It is also known for its light festival, the\u00a0F\u00eate des Lumi\u00e8res, which begins every 8 December and lasts for four days, earning Lyon the title of Capital of Lights.<br \/>\nEconomically, Lyon is a major centre for banking, as well as for the chemical, pharmaceutical, and biotech industries. The city contains a significant software industry with a particular focus on video games, and in recent years has fostered a growing local start-up sector.\u00a0Lyon hosts the international headquarters of\u00a0Interpol, the\u00a0International Agency for Research on Cancer\u00a0and\u00a0Euronews. According to the\u00a0Globalization and World Rankings Research Institute, Lyon is considered a\u00a0Beta city, as of 2018.\u00a0It ranked second in France and 40th globally in Mercer&#8217;s 2019\u00a0liveability rankings.<br \/>\n<strong>Historic Site of Lyon<\/strong> was designated a\u00a0UNESCO World Heritage Site\u00a0in 1998. In its designation, UNESCO cited the &#8220;exceptional testimony to the continuity of urban settlement over more than two millennia on a site of great commercial and strategic significance.&#8221;\u00a0The specific regions comprising the Historic Site include the Roman district and Fourvi\u00e8re, the\u00a0Renaissance\u00a0district (Vieux Lyon), the silk district (slopes of Croix-Rousse), and the Presqu&#8217;\u00eele, which features architecture from the 12th century to modern times.\u00a0Both Vieux Lyon and the slopes of Croix-Rousse are known for their narrow passageways (named\u00a0traboules) that pass through buildings and link streets on either side. The first examples of traboules are thought to have been built in Lyon in the 4th century.\u00a0The traboules allowed the inhabitants to get from their homes to the\u00a0Sa\u00f4ne\u00a0quickly and allowed the canuts on the Croix-Rousse hill to get from their workshops to the textile merchants at the foot of the hill.<br \/>\nThe district is only 3 or 4 streets wide at the level of the river with the huge hill of Croix-Rousse backing it. Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvi\u00e8re looms at the top of the hill.<br \/>\nThere was a large ceramics\/pottery market in the main square with many lovely items.<br \/>\nFronting the square is the St Etienne church dating from the 4<sup>th<\/sup> century. It has majestic stained glass with high windows in the central nave and large windows in all the very big, high side chapels. Next to it are the ruins of possibly the oldest church in the west outside of Rome dating to 150<br \/>\n<strong>Passerelle du Palais de Justice.<\/strong> This suspension pedestrian bridge has a single red tower on the east end and arcs nicely with a red girder bottom and yellow hand rails. The Palais de Justice is a magnificent building with 24 columns and Corinthian capitals.<br \/>\n<strong>Passerelle de l&#8217;Homme de la Roche.<\/strong> This narrow pedestrian bridge is a red girder bridge but with a single round tube and a tripod to the outside of the deck.<br \/>\n<strong>Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvi\u00e8re<\/strong>. This is easily the most spectacular church I have seen in France. The inside is almost completely covered with mosaic, 3 huge ones per side, the ceiling with its 3 domes and the apse. 4 sets of double columns separate the narrow aisles almost the same height as the central nave. The base has carvings of birds, then a grey marble column crowned by elaborate capitals with gilt haled eagles and statues on top. The chandeliers are cylinders of chains and chain mil.<br \/>\nThe exterior is equally wonderful with 4 crenellated towers each with a large copper cross. The fa\u00e7ade and portal are a riot of statues.<br \/>\n<strong>Lyon Botanical Garden.<\/strong> This is one of favourite gardens in Europe as it is so people friendly. Enter through great wrought iron gates to a road lined by flower boxes, all labeled with names I could understand including the registered name \u2013 begonia, peturnias, dahlias, lavender and many more. To the right is a large open area of palms, cacti and succulents including many agave and some wonderful African trees with giant feet or spines all over. There was also my favourite tree, the monkey puzzle tree (Fr. Le desespoir des singes), na\u00efve to Chile where I have seen the largest one in the world and forests of them. Of interest, they were spread around North America from an early garden in northern Vancouver Island, Ronnings Garden, planted in the early 1900s and recently revived. The rock gardens are surrounded by narrow ponds full of ducks and water lilies.<br \/>\nSurrounding the relatively small garden is a huge park, all grass and big trees with a large lake, a rose garden, zoo, velodrome, a memorial to soldiers. This would be a great place to spend a day and was packed at 6pm on a Sunday. Free<br \/>\n<strong>Le Part-Dieu<\/strong> is the central business district of Lyon. It has 150,000 m2 of office space with 45,000 workers, 2,500 companies, 120,000 residents, and a transportation hub with a high-speed train station (the leading interchange rail station in Europe with 120,000 travelers per day plus 500,000 daily commuters)<br \/>\n<strong>Tour Incity.<\/strong> In the NM \u201cModern Architecture Buildings\u201d, it is 202m-high with 39 floors, built in 2015. 2700 employees work on 32 floors and share the same corporate restaurant. It was the first tower in Lyon to obtain the low energy consumption label. The major tenants anre Casse d\u2019Epargne Bank and several SNCF branches.<br \/>\n<strong>Tour Part-Dieu.<\/strong> In the NM \u201cModern Architecture Buildings\u201d, it is 165m-high with 42 floors built in 1977. Mainly occupied by offices, it has the luxurious Radisson Blu Hotel on the top. It\u2019s nickname is le Crayon or the Pencil. The cladding is terracotta made of pozzolanic sands imitating the reddish Lyon tiles.<br \/>\n<strong>Le Part Dieu Mall<\/strong>. One of the largest urban shopping malls in Europe, it has 240 shops on five levels, a 14-screen multiplex cinema. The Oxygene tower adjoins it.<br \/>\n<strong>Les Halles de Lyon Paul Bocuse.<\/strong> This large enclosed market complex is a leading reference for French and Lyon cuisine with 48 merchants (fish, cheese, bakers and pastry, caterers and restaurants). It opened in 1971. Paul Bocuse was a famed starred French chef.<br \/>\n<strong>Passerelle de la Paix.<\/strong> A pedestrian and bicycle bridge over the Rhone River, it connects the 6<sup>th<\/sup> arrondissement and the commune of Caluire-et-Cuire. 217m long and 8m wide, it opened in 2014. The name reflects the large immigrant population of Saint Clair. It has 2 sections: 217m long upper section for pedestrians and cyclists and a 156m lower section uniquely for pedestrians only as it is all stairs.<br \/>\n<strong>Passerelle du Coll\u00e8ge.<\/strong> This suspension bridge over the Rhone River opened in 1845. During the construction, a bolt holding a cable in its sheath broke, the bridge collapsed and 8 workers drowned.<br \/>\nOriginally the right bank had the 1519 College of the Trinity that became the Ampere High School. The bridge allowed the students to not detour by the Morand and Lafayette bridges. It is an iron wire bridge that has 3 piles with tree bays at the center (96m) and the quarters (42.5m form each end) and is 4m wide. Part was damaged at the Liberation in 1944. It crosses from Quai Jean-Moulin to the General-Sarrail wharf.<br \/>\n<strong>Halle Tony Garnier.<\/strong> In the NM \u201cModern Architecture Buildings\u201d, this is an arena and concert hall designed by Tony Garnier in 1905. Originally a slaughterhouse, it was renovated in 1987 as a concert hall with a capacity of 17,000. Virtually every rock band and performer has played there.<\/p>\n<p><em>I left Lyon for Geneva and made a few stops on the way. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Chamb<\/strong><strong>\u00e9ry. <\/strong>(pop 61,000)<br \/>\nIt was the historical capital of the Savoy region from 1295-1563 which then included an area from Bourg-en-Bresse on the west, across the alps to Turin, north to Geneva and south to Nice. The capital moved to Turin in 1563. It sat on the crossroads of several ancient trade routes between Dauphine, Burgundy, Switzerland and Italy. It is in a wide valley on the Leysse River between the Bauges and Chartreuse Mountains. It is a major railway hub, midpoint between Turin and Lyon. It is 100kms east of Lyon and 83kms west of Geneva.<br \/>\n<strong>Annecy<\/strong> (pop 131,000)<br \/>\nThis is an alpine city on the north tip of Lake Annecy 35kms south of Geneva known for its old town with cobbled streets, 3 winding canals and the Thiou River and pastel-coloured houses.
