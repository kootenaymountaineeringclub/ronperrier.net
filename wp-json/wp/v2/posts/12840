Chop 1\/2 c each dried cranberry and apricots. Add 1 c currants, 1 c shredded (large flake?) coconut, 1 c large flake rolled oats, 1\/2 c ground flax, 1\/2 c Rice Krispies, 1\/4 c each of pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and sesame seeds, Zest of 1 orange, minced.<br \/>\nMelt 24 oz semi-sweet chocolate chips + 18 oz peanut butter chips + 1 tbsp molasses in double boiler<br \/>\nPour over mixture and mix well. Press onto a cookie sheet. Cool and cut into 2\u00d74 chunks. Wrap in Saran or tin foil. Freeze or store in fridge.<strong><br \/>\nVegetable Crisps.<\/strong>\u00a0Pick any of your favourite root vegetables, peel them, slice them very thin using a mandolin and dehydrate. If desired, sprinkle with salt when still damp after slicing. My favourite are sweet potatoes (all 3 varieties). Also try beets, parsnip, carrot, potato, turnip. Over dehydrate to produce crisps.<br \/>\n<strong>Apple Crisps.\u00a0<\/strong>Apple crisps are somewhat similar to apple chips but they aren\u2019t fried, but sliced paper thin and dehydrated to a crispy state. To make apple crisps take 4-6 Royal Gala or Granny Smith apples (1 apple fills one dehydrator tray, 4 apples give a nice sandwich-sized ziploc bag of crisps).<br \/>\nPeel, quarter, core and slice them paperthin using a mandolin (be careful with your finger tips by slowing down as you approach the end). They end up less than a mm thick. Place them in lemon juice. Add vanilla or other extracts. Drain the apples. Place on lined dehydrator trays and sprinkle lightly with cinnamon or cinnamon\/nutmeg. Dry the apples at 135\u00b0F for 8 to 10 hours, until they are crispy like chips. Let cool and pack in a sturdy airtight container or small ziploc.<br \/>\nApples are wonderful in savory dishes as well. I often use dried apples in coleslaw and other trail salads, in a wrap with chicken, or I use fresh apples in recipes like this one and then dehydrate the whole dish.<br \/>\n<strong>Other Fruit:<\/strong>\u00a0Fruit leather, raisins, currants, dried fruit (apricots, plums, berries)<\/p>\n<p><strong>GRANOLA<\/strong><br \/>\nThe following are suggestions. Individualize according to personal preferences.<br \/>\n10c Old Fashioned rolled oats<br \/>\n1-3 c rolled or flaked rye, wheat or barley<br \/>\n1-2 c wheat bran (great as bowel stimulant)<br \/>\n\u00bd &#8211; 1 c ground flax<br \/>\n\u00bd c Quinoa (uncooked) for crunch<br \/>\n\u00bd c each nuts: pecans, almonds, cashews, hazelnuts, walnuts, mixed nuts<br \/>\n\u00bd c each raw seeds: pumpkin seeds, sunflower, sesame seeds<br \/>\n1 c coconut big flakes<br \/>\n1-2 tsp salt<br \/>\n1 tsp vanilla or maple extract<br \/>\n??Spices: cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, or cardamom, even savory herbs like rosemary<br \/>\n<strong>Mix well and add<br \/>\n<\/strong>1 c oil \u2013 melted coconut oil (may be best), canola (neutral flavor), olive oil (more bitter)<br \/>\nEgg white (whisk in small bowl until foamy) \u2013 for a lighter, healthier granola, helps bind the ingredients and makes it crispy.<br \/>\n1 c honey (heat in a microwave first to make it easy to mix in) or maple syrup, Chocolate: \u00bc c cocoa powder<br \/>\n<strong>Bake<\/strong>\u00a0oven at 300\u00b0 until right texture. I use a large soup pot that can go in the oven, stir every half hour till done, (most people cook on a cookie sheet at 300 for 45 minutes. To chunk it up, don\u2019t stir while baking, when cooled break it into chunks) then after baking and cooled down,<br \/>\n<strong>Add<\/strong><br \/>\nDried fruit 1 c: currants, cranberries, dried apricots, goji berries, dried figs, apples, pineapple, mango, raisins, , cherries, blueberries (chop larger pieces up). I personally like cranberries and currants<br \/>\nCitrus zest: lemon, lime or grapefruit<\/p>\n<p><strong>PEPPERONI AND CHEESE QUESADILLA<\/strong> Serves 1<br \/>\n2 tbsp tomato sauce<br \/>\n1 tsp olive oil<br \/>\n1 medium-size wheat flour tortilla<br \/>\n1 handful (about 50g\/1.76oz) grated cheddar cheese<br \/>\n6\u20138 slices shelf-stable pepperoni<br \/>\n<em>In camp<\/em>: Heat the olive oil in a frying pan.

Rehydrate with dehydrated hamburger or spicy Italian sausage meat<br \/>\nDehydrate hamburger or Italian sausage meat. (needs to be stored separately in freezer so it will not spoil. Store in \u00bc pound portions). Rehydrate as above with pasta sauce.<br \/>\nServe with thin spaghetti. Parmesan cheese.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Chili Con Carne with Chocolate<br \/>\n<\/strong>Why\u00a0add chocolate\u00a0to\u00a0chili? The taste will be unrecognizable. But somehow, mysteriously,\u00a0chocolate\u00a0adds depth and smoothness to\u00a0chili.

Add oil, saut\u00e9 onion for few minutes. Add garlic, celery, and green peppers and saut\u00e9 5-8 minutes. Add all spices and cocoa and stir well. Add beef, beans, tomatoes, tomato paste, brown sugar and vinegar. Boil and then simmer for 1 hour.<br \/>\nServe with grated cheddar cheese, as chili fries, or in a burrito (flour tortilla, chili, grated cheese, rice, sour cream, black olives, green onions, salsa).<br \/>\n<em>Other potential ingredients<\/em> to spice up chili; Worcestershire Sauce, Coffee or Espresso Powder, Sweet Spices, Peanut Butter, Molasses, Marmite or Vegemite.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4.
