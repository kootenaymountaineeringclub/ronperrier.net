The archipelago is made up of two populated islands, Madeira and Porto Santo, and two groups of unpopulated islands called the Desertas and Selvagens Islands. Geographically in\u00a0Africa, it is an ultra-peripheral region of the European Union. It is perhaps best known as the birthplace of the Portuguese football (soccer) player Cristiano Ronaldo.<br \/>\nMadeira island is 500 km from the African coast and 1,000 km from the European continent, only 1.5 hr flight from mainland Portugal and about 3 hr from all the main countries in Europe.<br \/>\nKnown worldwide as the Islands of eternal spring, Madeira, &#8220;Ilha Jardim&#8221; (Garden Island) or &#8220;Pearl of the Atlantic&#8221;, has a mild climate throughout the entire year. Just a short trip from Europe (4 hours from UK), one can combine holidays by the sea, in the mountains or in the city.<br \/>\nThe levadas, an ingenious system of stone- and concrete-lined watercourses distributing water from the rainy north to the dry south, help flowers and crops flourish all year. That&#8217;s why this island is called the Garden in the Atlantic. The maintenance pathways for these water canals provide wonderful level trails for hiking in the mountains (up to 1861 m) and through the tremendous landscape.<br \/>\n<em><strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/em><\/span><\/div>\n<div class=\"entry-meta\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>LAUREL FOREST<\/strong> World Heritage Site<strong><em><br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Laurisilva of Madeira is a type of\u00a0subtropical\u00a0forest found in areas with high\u00a0humidity\u00a0and relatively stable, mild temperatures &#8211; wet forests from sea level to the highest mountains,. They need an\u00a0ecosystem\u00a0of high humidity, such as\u00a0cloud forests, with abundant rainfall throughout the year usually on tropical or subtropical\u00a0mountains. Laurel forests are typically multi-species, and diverse in both the number of species and the genera and families represented. Species diversity generally increases towards the tropics.\u00a0In this sense, the laurel forest is a transitional type between temperate forests and tropical rainforests.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The<\/span>\u00a0trees reach up to 40 metres (130\u00a0ft) in height.\u00a0Some species belong to the true laurel family, but many have similar foliage to the Lauraceae due to\u00a0convergent evolution and adapt to high rainfall and humidity &#8211; leaves that repel water due to a generous layer of\u00a0wax, making them glossy in appearance, and a narrow, pointed oval shape with an\u00a0apical mucro\u00a0or \u201cdrip tip\u201d, which permits the leaves to shed water despite the humidity, allowing perspiration and respiration.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Mature laurel forests typically have a dense\u00a0tree canopy\u00a0and low light levels at the forest floor.<br \/>\n<em>I walked through several areas of Laurel forest &#8211; on the walk to Risco Falls, at the levada above Santana (great trees) and drove through several areas.\u00a0<\/em><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Origin.\u00a0<\/strong>Laurel forests are composed of\u00a0vascular plants\u00a0that evolved millions of years ago including the southern beech.

They were used in the past also by women to wash clothes in areas where running water to homes was not available. The idea of this style of water channel was brought to Portugal by the\u00a0Moors\u00a0during the time of\u00a0al-Andalus. Similar examples can still be found in Iberia, such as some\u00a0Acequias\u00a0in Spain.<br \/>\nIn the sixteenth century, the Portuguese started building levadas to carry water to the agricultural regions. The most recent were made in the 1940s. Madeira is very mountainous, and building the levadas was often difficult. Many are cut into the sides of mountains, and it was also necessary to dig 25 kilometres (16 mi) of tunnels. Today the levadas not only supply water to the southern parts of the island, they also provide hydroelectric power. Hiking. There are more than 1,350 miles (2,170 km) of levadas and they provide a remarkable network of walking paths.

Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos (DOB 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for Serie A club Juventus and captains the Portugal national team. Often considered the best player in the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d&#8217;Or awards and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 32 major trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, one UEFA European Championship, and one UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most goals (134) and assists (42) in the Champions League, most goals in the European Championship (14), and is currently tied with Ali Daei for most international goals (109). He is one of the few recorded players to have made over 1,100 professional career appearances and has scored over 780 official senior career goals for club and country.<br \/>\nBorn and raised in Madeira, Ronaldo began his senior club career playing for Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, aged 18, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League, and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d&#8217;Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth \u20ac94 million (\u00a380 million), where he won 15 trophies, including two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, four Champions Leagues, and became the club&#8217;s all-time top goalscorer. He also finished runner-up for the Ballon d&#8217;Or three times, behind Lionel Messi (his perceived career rival), and won back-to-back Ballons d&#8217;Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017. In 2018, Ronaldo signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial \u20ac100 million (\u00a388 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and the most expensive transfer for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana, and a Coppa Italia in his first three seasons with the club.<br \/>\nRonaldo made his senior international debut for Portugal in 2003 at age 18 and has since earned over 170 caps, including appearing and scoring in eleven major tournaments, becoming Portugal&#8217;s most-capped player and his country&#8217;s all-time top goalscorer. He scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final, and assumed full captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first triumph in a major tournament by winning Euro 2016 and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. He also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020.<br \/>\nOne of the most marketable and famous athletes in the world, Ronaldo was ranked the\u00a0world&#8217;s highest-paid athlete\u00a0by\u00a0<i>Forbes<\/i>\u00a0in 2016 and 2017 and the world&#8217;s most famous athlete by\u00a0ESPN\u00a0from 2016 to 2019.\u00a0<i>Time<\/i>\u00a0included him on their list of the\u00a0100 most influential people in the world\u00a0in 2014.
