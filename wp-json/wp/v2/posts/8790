After 55 min. of bushwhacking, we emerged at the base of a rockslide north of Jackson Pk. (327-753). A traverse left and easier terrain got us to a picturesque sub-alpine lake at 6450\u2019 (331-751). Heading east, we crossed the outlet stream, descended to an unmarked pond, and ascended a rock and grass couloir on Craig\u2019s west face. Now on the south ridge, we sprinted to the cairned summit (no record) in 10-15 min. (3 hrs. 10 min. up).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">During our hour on top, we huddled under rock overhangs to escape the fierce heat and admired lakes in nearby Kianuko Provincial Park (one of those places you\u2019ve never heard of). <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">For the descent, we inspected the west ridge but decided instead to retrace our steps. This we did to the rockslide; from that point we took a diagonal to the northwest, hoping for better bushwhacking. After what I call a moderate thrash, we emerged in the cutblock some 200 m. north or right of the truck, and if anything this portion was even worse on the descent. I deftly kept some 40 m. ahead of Janice and Kyle so that her gasps and curses as she fell into yet another concealed trap were scarcely audible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Back at the truck by 3:15 (2 hr. 25 min. descent; 6 hr. 45 min. day), I mollified my spouse by switching on the air conditioner and motoring smoothly to catch the 5:20. Despite the blast furnace heat, Kyle and I were up for a cappuccino at the 24\/7 bakery in Balfour before returning to Nelson by 7:00 pm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Howie Ridge and Peter McIver climbed Craig by its west ridge (north ridge descent) some years ago and remember only moderate bushwhacking. That may be, but I\u2019ll wait a bit before tackling Craig\u2019s southern neighbour Jackson Pk.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Kim Kratky<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>CRAIG PEAK\u00a0 \u00a02443 m\u00a0 \u00a08015\u2019 by Kim Kratky\u00a0 Map: 82F\/7 Boswell Craig Pk., 3.5 km. south of Haystack Mtn., is one of a series of minor-league protruberances along the east and south side of Sanca Creek on Kootenay Lake\u2019s East &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2017\/12\/13\/mount-craig\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-8790","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-uncategorized"],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p2Ncip-2hM","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8790","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8790"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8790\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":20502,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8790\/revisions\/20502"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8790"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8790"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8790"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
