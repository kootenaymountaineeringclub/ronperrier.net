May 8-9, 2022<\/p>\n<p><em>In my quest to finish all the countries in the Caribbean (and thus the Western Hemisphere), I flew from Montego Bay, Jamaica to Nassau (Frontier, 22 hours with an 18-hour layover in Orlando for $CAD200). I made an attempt to see as much of Nassau as possible and then flew home to Comox (Westjet via Ottawa and Calgary, 13 hours, $400). So this leaves St Vincent &amp; the Grenadines as my only unvisited country &#8211; it was simply too expensive to fly and had antiquated covid rules. I was also tired after 10 months and wanted to get home and have a rest.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Covid.<\/strong> Because of my positive test on Feb 10, I wanted to avoid more tests. One must obtain a letter of exemption. I emailed <a href=\"mailto:bthv@bahamas.gov.bs\">bthv@bahamas.gov.bs<\/a> with my vaccination record, positive test, Doctor\u2019s letter of recovery, and my passport and promptly received the exemption. The exemption letter had not been added to the travel.gov.bs website and needs to be put in place of the covid test results. Antigen tests are $150 (PCR $300) at the Fort Lauderdale Airport.<br \/>\nGo to travel.gov.bs to fill in the travel visa, one of the more cumbersome travel forms to fill out as you have to list every detail of your covid testing site (phone number, address, zip code) and every other detail of your past life.<br \/>\nPay $40 for the visa (includes travel insurance)<br \/>\nOne must check in daily to report symptoms or face a $100 fine per day.<br \/>\nNot wearing a mask in public faces a $250 fine.<\/p>\n<p><em>I personally had no reason to come to the Bahamas other than it was another country on my way to 193. I had gotten a cheap CAD$200 flight from Jamaica (Frontier but the $134 baggage fee made it much more expensive. Frontier is the cheapest airline with no free food, snacks, or drinks. No wonder both my flights were essentially empty).\u00a0 <\/em><br \/>\n<em>I don&#8217;t go to beaches (other than walk and rarely swim), resorts, casinos, bone fish, golf, or shop, which is all the country offers. It is an extremely expensive place suitable for people on a 1-2 week holiday staying at resorts and with unlimited money.<br \/>\nI rented a car ($92\/day) as I wanted to see Nassau and taxis were $25 from the airport.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Accommodation is very expensive in the Bahamas. On New Providence (Nassau) there is one place for under $300, Ocean Front Hostel. I tried to find it but it is not on Google Maps. The address is 799 West Bay Street but there is no sign for Ocean Front Hostel, only Viking Hill. I stopped in at Ocean Mist Hotel, 3 doors away and they had never heard of it, but located it from photos on the website. When I arrived, there was no one around. Bahamas Vacations Club sends so many emails that are so long that I mistakenly blocked them out. Apparently one has to call WhatsApp\u00a0+1 242 432 0468 and inform the host that you are coming. I didn&#8217;t have a SIM so was dependent on the wifi to communicate. When talking to her, it was Mother&#8217;s Day and she obviously wasn&#8217;t coming. She sent my bed number by text. It was occupied so I took the only made-up bed. Apparently, it was someone else&#8217;s and she phoned me irrate. This 12-bed door has an income of over CAD$700 per night and one would think they might provide some service.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>The room is a 12-bed dorm room. There is one toilet and 3 showers. People lock the door when using the BR even though the showers have curtains and the toilet a separate door. There was no toilet paper. I had luckily saved napkins from Wendy&#8217;s at the airport.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>I left at 8 am to drive and see what there was in Nassau before my flight home at 13:30.<br \/>\nThe hostel is 15 km west of Nassau in an area with no services.<br \/>\nThe people of the Bahamas are almost entirely black. Outside of resorts and downtown Nassau, one sees no white folks. It would appear that there is a huge income disparity here.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>NASSAU\u00a0<\/strong>(pop 274,400) is the\u00a0capital\u00a0and largest city of\u00a0The Bahamas with\u00a070% of the entire population of The Bahamas. Nassau is commonly defined as a\u00a0primate city, dwarfing all other towns in the country.\u00a0It is the centre of commerce, education, law, administration, and media of the country.<br \/>\nLynden Pindling International Airport, the major airport for the Bahamas, is located about 16\u00a0km (9.9\u00a0mi) west of the city centre of Nassau and has daily flights to major cities in\u00a0Canada, the\u00a0Caribbean, the\u00a0United Kingdom,\u00a0and the\u00a0United States. The city is located on the island of\u00a0New Providence.<br \/>\nNassau is the site of the House of Assembly and various judicial departments and was considered historically to be a stronghold of pirates.\u00a0The city was named in honour of\u00a0William III of England, Prince of Orange-Nassau.<br \/>\nNassau&#8217;s modern growth began in the late eighteenth century, with the influx of thousands of\u00a0Loyalists\u00a0and their slaves to the Bahamas following the\u00a0American War of Independence. Many of them settled in Nassau and eventually came to outnumber the original inhabitants.<br \/>\nAs the population of Nassau grew, so did its populated areas. Today the city dominates the entire island and its satellite,\u00a0Paradise Island. However, until the post-Second World War era, the outer suburbs scarcely existed. Most of New Providence was uncultivated bush until Loyalists were resettled there following the American Revolutionary War; they established several plantations, such as Clifton and Tusculum. Slaves were imported as labour.<br \/>\nAfter the British abolished the international slave trade in 1807, they resettled thousands of Africans liberated from slave ships by the\u00a0Royal Navy\u00a0on New Providence (at Adelaide Village and Gambier Village), along with other islands such as Grand Bahama, Exuma, Abaco and Inagua. In addition, slaves freed from American ships, such as the\u00a0Creole case\u00a0in 1841, were allowed to settle there. The largest concentration of Africans historically lived in the &#8220;Over-the-Hill&#8221; suburbs of Grants Town and Bain Town to the south of the city of Nassau, while most of the inhabitants of European descent lived on the island&#8217;s northern coastal ridges.<\/p>\n<p><em>I drove the 15 km into Nassau along West Bay Street past a continuous line of resorts with their private beaches. Houses are opulent and everything is very pretty and newly painted in many pastel colours. The vegetation and boulevards are planted with lovely palms and flowering bushes.<\/em><br \/>\n<strong>Nassau Harbour Lighthouse.<\/strong> Sitting at the far west end of Paradise Island at the entrance to the harbour, it is a white, conical lighthouse with a viewing platform that is not accessible.<br \/>\n<strong>Ardastra Gardens, Zoo and Conservation Centre.<\/strong> A lush tropical garden with mostly birds and rescue animals including a capybara, and one monkey.

It was closed because of covid.<br \/>\nParadise Island Bridge. Two bridges (one southbound and one northbound) arch highly over the straight. between Nassau and Paradise Island. There are many piers.<br \/>\nNassau Straw Market. All clothing, knick-knacks, bags and jewelry. No produce.<br \/>\n<strong>Christ Church Cathedral.<\/strong> Made of white limestone, the inside is lovely with a dramatic set of 3 stained glass windows behind the altar.

Enslaved Africans and other commodities were sold at Vendue House during the 18th and 19th centuries. Pompey became a museum in 1992.<br \/>\n<strong>The Heritage Museum of the Bahamas<\/strong>.

Designed by Trinity House in England, these light stations were built and manned by local British subjects, the ancestors of present-day Bahamians.<br \/>\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, the ILS updated all of the light stations so that each had a Fresnel lens, a Chance Brothers mercury bath turning mechanism, and a mantle burning Hood Petroleum Vapor burner.<br \/>\nEight were automated to solar and battery power between 1973 and 1995. All Fresnel lenses and burners were either destroyed or removed to Nassau as were some of the clock-work turning mechanisms.<br \/>\nThese lighthouses embody the nation\u2019s rich cultural and historical past, playing a crucial role in the development of The Bahamas and surrounding colonies.<br \/>\n<strong>Elbow Reef Lighthouse<\/strong>, on Elbow Cay, west of the harbour at Hope Town, Abaco (1864). The tower is 89 feet high and there are 101 steps up to the lantern room. The lighthouse is painted with horizontal red and white bands. This is probably the most visited lighthouse in The Bahamas.<br \/>\n<strong>Hole-in-the-Wall Lighthouse<\/strong>\u00a0on the Southern tip of Great Abaco (1836) and is still active today.\u00a0 The name \u00a0Hole-in-the-Wall referred to a limestone arch at the land\u2019s end near the lighthouse.\u00a0 This lighthouse is one of the best examples of old-style British lighthouse architecture in the New World. The red and white tower stands at 77 feet and 168 feet above sea level.<br \/>\n<strong>Great Isaac Lighthouse<\/strong> (1859)\u00a0is located 18 miles north of the Bimini archipelago.

The tower stands at 60 feet. The lighthouse was decommissioned in 1934<br \/>\n<strong>Cay Lobos Lighthouse<\/strong>\u00a0(1869). Its round cast iron tower stands at 45 m (148 ft). The tiny cay is, a famous hazard to navigation, is located in the Old Bahama Channel only 50 kilometers (30 miles) off the north coast of Cuba, but it is owned by The Bahamas. For lighthouse keepers, it was the most isolated posting in The Bahamas.<br \/>\n<strong>Southwest Point Lighthouse<\/strong> (1870)\u00a0is located at the southwestern tip of Great Inagua near Matthew Town.\u00a0 It is a round masonry tower that stands at 34 m (112 ft) with a lantern and gallery painted white.<br \/>\n<strong>Gun Cay<\/strong> (1836) is located at the south end of Gun Cay, which is less than 10 miles south of Bimini.\u00a0 The 77-foot round old-style stone tower is surmounted by a short square pyramidal skeletal tower.

It takes up 97% of the Lucayan Archipelago&#8217;s land area and is home to 88% of the archipelago&#8217;s population. The\u00a0archipelagic state\u00a0consists of more than 3000\u00a0islands,\u00a0cays, and\u00a0islets\u00a0in the Atlantic Ocean, and is located north of\u00a0Cuba\u00a0and northwest of the island of\u00a0Hispaniola\u00a0(split between\u00a0Haiti\u00a0and the\u00a0Dominican Republic) and the\u00a0Turks and Caicos Islands, southeast of the\u00a0American\u00a0state of\u00a0Florida, and east of the\u00a0Florida Keys. The capital is\u00a0Nassau\u00a0on the island of\u00a0New Providence. The\u00a0Royal Bahamas Defence Force\u00a0describes The Bahamas&#8217; territory as encompassing 470,000\u00a0km2\u00a0(180,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of ocean space.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HISTORY<\/strong><br \/>\nThe Bahama Islands were inhabited by the\u00a0Lucayans, a branch of the\u00a0Arawakan-speaking\u00a0Ta\u00edno, for many centuries. Christopher Columbus\u00a0was the first European to see the islands, making his first landfall in the &#8220;New World&#8221; in 1492. Later, the\u00a0Spanish\u00a0shipped the native Lucayans to and enslaved them on\u00a0Hispaniola, after which the Bahama islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648, when\u00a0English\u00a0colonists from\u00a0Bermuda\u00a0settled on the island of\u00a0Eleuthera.<br \/>\nThe Bahamas became a\u00a0British\u00a0crown colony\u00a0in 1718, when the British clamped down on\u00a0piracy. After the\u00a0American Revolutionary War, the Crown resettled thousands of\u00a0American Loyalists\u00a0to the Bahamas; they took enslaved people with them and established\u00a0plantations\u00a0on land grants. African enslaved people and their descendants constituted the majority of the population from this period on. The slave trade was abolished by the British in 1807; slavery in the Bahamas was abolished in 1834. Subsequently, the Bahamas became a haven for freed African slaves. Africans liberated from illegal slave ships were resettled on the islands by the\u00a0Royal Navy, while some\u00a0North American slaves\u00a0and\u00a0Seminoles\u00a0escaped to the Bahamas from Florida. Bahamians were even known to recognise the freedom of enslaved people carried by the ships of other nations which reached the Bahamas. Today\u00a0Afro-Bahamians\u00a0make up 90% of the population of 400,516.<br \/>\nThe country gained governmental independence in 1973, led by\u00a0Sir Lynden O. Pindling, with\u00a0Elizabeth II\u00a0as\u00a0its queen.\u00a0In terms of\u00a0gross domestic product\u00a0per capita, The Bahamas is one of the richest countries in the\u00a0Americas\u00a0(following the United States and Canada), with an economy based on tourism and offshore finance.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GEOGRAPHY<br \/>\n<\/strong>The Bahamas consists of a\u00a0chain of islands\u00a0spread out over some 800 kilometres (500\u00a0mi) in the Atlantic Ocean, located to the east of\u00a0Florida\u00a0in the United States, north of Cuba and\u00a0Hispaniola\u00a0and west of the British Overseas Territory of the\u00a0Turks and Caicos Islands\u00a0(with which it forms the\u00a0Lucayan archipelago). It lies between latitudes\u00a020\u00b0\u00a0and\u00a028\u00b0N, and longitudes\u00a072\u00b0\u00a0and\u00a080\u00b0W\u00a0and straddles the\u00a0Tropic of Cancer.\u00a0There are some 700 islands and 2,400 cays in total (of which 30 are inhabited) with a total land area of 10,010\u00a0km2\u00a0(3,860\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).<br \/>\nNassau, capital city of The Bahamas, lies on the island of\u00a0New Providence; the other main inhabited islands are\u00a0Grand Bahama,\u00a0Eleuthera,\u00a0Cat Island,\u00a0Rum Cay,\u00a0Long Island,\u00a0San Salvador Island,\u00a0Ragged Island,\u00a0Acklins,\u00a0Crooked Island,\u00a0Exuma,\u00a0Berry Islands,\u00a0Mayaguana, the\u00a0Bimini\u00a0islands,\u00a0Great Abaco\u00a0and\u00a0Great Inagua. The largest island is\u00a0Andros.<br \/>\nAll the islands are low and flat, with ridges that usually rise no more than 15 to 20\u00a0m (49 to 66\u00a0ft). The highest point in the country is\u00a0Mount Alvernia\u00a0(formerly Como Hill) on Cat Island at 64\u00a0m (210\u00a0ft).<br \/>\nThe country contains three terrestrial ecoregions:\u00a0Bahamian dry forests,\u00a0Bahamian pine mosaic, and\u00a0Bahamian mangroves.\u00a0It had a 2019\u00a0Forest Landscape Integrity Index\u00a0mean score of 7.35\/10, ranking it 44th globally out of 172 countries.<br \/>\n<strong>Climate.\u00a0<\/strong>The climate of The Bahamas is mostly\u00a0tropical savannah climate with a hot and wet season and a warm and dry season. The low latitude, warm tropical\u00a0Gulf Stream, and low\u00a0elevation\u00a0give The Bahamas a warm and winterless climate.<br \/>\nAs with most tropical climates, seasonal rainfall follows the sun, and summer is the wettest season. There is only a 7\u00a0\u00b0C (13\u00a0\u00b0F) difference between the warmest month and coolest month in most of the Bahama islands.<br \/>\nTropical storms and hurricanes occasionally impact The Bahamas. In 1992,\u00a0Hurricane Andrew\u00a0passed over the northern portions of the islands, and\u00a0Hurricane Floyd\u00a0passed near the eastern portions of the islands in 1999.\u00a0Hurricane Dorian\u00a0of 2019 passed over the archipelago at destructive\u00a0Category\u00a05 strength\u00a0with sustained winds of 298\u00a0km\/h (185\u00a0mph) and wind gusts up to 350\u00a0km\/h (220\u00a0mph), becoming the strongest tropical cyclone on record to impact the northwestern islands of Grand Bahama and Great Abaco.<br \/>\n<strong>Geology.<\/strong> It was generally believed that the Bahamas were formed in approximately 200 million years ago, when Pangaea started to break apart. In current times, it endures as an archipelago containing over 700 islands and cays, fringed around different\u00a0coral reefs. The\u00a0limestone\u00a0that comprises the Banks has been accumulating since at least the\u00a0Cretaceous\u00a0period, and perhaps as early as the\u00a0Jurassic; today the total thickness under the Great Bahama Bank is over 4.5 kilometres (2.8 miles).\u00a0As the limestone was deposited in shallow water, the only way to explain this massive column is to estimate that the entire platform has\u00a0subsided\u00a0under its own weight at a rate of roughly 3.6 centimetres (2 inches) per 1,000 years. The 6.4\u00a0km (4.0\u00a0mi) thick\u00a0limestones, which predominate in The Bahamas, date back to the\u00a0Cretaceous. Then, at about 80\u00a0Ma, the area became flooded by the\u00a0Gulf Stream. This resulted in the drowning of the Blake Plateau, the separation of The Bahamas from Cuba and Florida, the separation of the southeastern Bahamas into separate banks, Coral reefs\u00a0form the &#8220;retaining walls&#8221; of these atolls.<br \/>\nCoral growth was greater through the\u00a0Tertiary, until the start of the\u00a0ice ages, and hence those deposits are more abundant below a depth of 36\u00a0m (118\u00a0ft). In fact, an ancient extinct reef exists half a km seaward of the present one, 30\u00a0m (98\u00a0ft) below sea level. Oolites form when oceanic water penetrates the shallow banks, increasing the temperature by about 3\u00a0\u00b0C (5.4\u00a0\u00b0F) and the salinity by 0.5 percent.\u00a0Cemented\u00a0ooids\u00a0are referred to as grapestone. Additionally, giant\u00a0stromatolites\u00a0are found off the\u00a0Exuma Cays.[84]:\u200a22,\u200a29\u201330<br \/>\nSea level changes\u00a0resulted in a drop in sea level, causing wind-blown oolite to form\u00a0sand dunes\u00a0with distinct\u00a0cross-bedding. Overlapping dunes form oolitic ridges, which become rapidly\u00a0lithified\u00a0through the action of rainwater, called\u00a0eolianite. Most islands have ridges ranging from 30 to 45\u00a0m (98 to 148\u00a0ft), though Cat Island has a ridge 60\u00a0m (200\u00a0ft) in height. The land between ridges is conducive to the formation of lakes and swamps.[84]:\u200a41\u201359,\u200a61\u201364<br \/>\nSolution weathering\u00a0of the limestone results in a &#8220;Bahamian\u00a0Karst&#8221; topography. This includes\u00a0potholes,\u00a0blue holes\u00a0such as\u00a0Dean&#8217;s Blue Hole,\u00a0sinkholes,\u00a0beachrock\u00a0such as the\u00a0Bimini Road\u00a0(&#8220;pavements of Atlantis&#8221;),\u00a0limestone crust, caves due to the lack of rivers, and\u00a0sea caves. Several blue holes are aligned along the South Andros\u00a0Fault\u00a0line.\u00a0Tidal flats\u00a0and\u00a0tidal creeks\u00a0are common, but the more impressive drainage patterns are formed by troughs and canyons such as\u00a0Great Bahama Canyon\u00a0with the evidence of\u00a0turbidity currents\u00a0and\u00a0turbidite\u00a0deposition.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ECONOMY<br \/>\n<\/strong>By the terms of\u00a0GDP per capita, The Bahamas is one of the richest countries in the\u00a0Americas. Its currency (the\u00a0Bahamian dollar) is kept at a 1-to-1\u00a0peg\u00a0with the\u00a0US dollar.<br \/>\nThe Bahamas relies heavily on\u00a0tourism\u00a0to generate most of its economic activity. Tourism as an industry not only accounts for about 50% of the Bahamian GDP, but also provides jobs for about half of the country&#8217;s workforce.\u00a0The Bahamas attracted 5.8\u00a0million visitors in 2012, more than 70% of whom were cruise visitors.<br \/>\nAfter tourism, the next most important economic sector is banking and\u00a0offshore international financial services, accounting for some 15% of GDP.\u00a0It was revealed in the\u00a0Panama Papers\u00a0that The Bahamas is the jurisdiction with the most offshore entities or companies in the world.<br \/>\nThe economy has a very competitive tax regime (classified by some as a\u00a0tax haven). The government derives its revenue from import tariffs,\u00a0VAT, licence fees, property and stamp taxes, but there is no income tax, corporate tax, capital gains tax, or wealth tax. Payroll taxes fund social insurance benefits and amount to 3.9% paid by the employee and 5.9% paid by the employer.<br \/>\nAgriculture and manufacturing form the third largest sector of the Bahamian economy, representing 5\u20137% of total GDP.\u00a0An estimated 80% of the Bahamian food supply is imported. Major crops include\u00a0onions,\u00a0okra,\u00a0tomatoes,\u00a0oranges,\u00a0grapefruit,\u00a0cucumbers,\u00a0sugar cane,\u00a0lemons,\u00a0limes, and\u00a0sweet potatoes.<br \/>\n<strong>Transport.<\/strong> The Bahamas contains about 1,620\u00a0km (1,010\u00a0mi) of paved roads.\u00a0Inter-island transport is conducted primarily via ship and air. The country has 61 airports, the chief of which are\u00a0Lynden Pindling International Airport\u00a0on New Providence,\u00a0Grand Bahama International Airport\u00a0on Grand Bahama Island and\u00a0Leonard M. Thompson International Airport on Abaco Island.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DEMOGRAPHICS<br \/>\n<\/strong>The Bahamas had a population of 385,637 at the 2018 Census, of which 25.9% were 14 or under, 67.2% were 15 to 64 and 6.9% were over 65. Residents have a life expectancy of 69.87 years: 73.49 years for females, and 66.32 years for males.<br \/>\nThe most populous islands are\u00a0New Providence, where\u00a0Nassau, the capital and largest city, is located;\u00a0and\u00a0Grand Bahama, home to the second-largest city of\u00a0Freeport.<br \/>\n<strong>Racial and ethnic groups. <\/strong>90.6% Black, 4.7%\u00a0White,\u00a0and 2.1% of a\u00a0Mixed\u00a0(African and European).\u00a0Three centuries prior, in 1722 when the first official census of The Bahamas was taken, 74% of the population was native European and 26% native African.<br \/>\nSince the colonial era of plantations,\u00a0Africans\u00a0or\u00a0Afro-Bahamians\u00a0have been the largest ethnic group, whose primary ancestry was in\u00a0West Africa. The first Africans to arrive to The Bahamas were freed slaves from\u00a0Bermuda.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Haitian\u00a0community in The Bahamas is also largely of African descent and numbers about 80,000. Due to an extremely high immigration of Haitians to The Bahamas, the Bahamian government started deporting illegal Haitian immigrants to their homeland in late 2014.<br \/>\nThe white Bahamian population are mainly the descendants of the\u00a0English Puritans\u00a0and\u00a0American Loyalists\u00a0escaping the\u00a0American Revolution\u00a0who arrived in 1649 and 1783, respectively.\u00a0Many Southern Loyalists went to the\u00a0Abaco Islands, half of whose population was of European descent as of 1985. The term\u00a0white\u00a0is usually used to identify Bahamians with Anglo ancestry, as well as some light-skinned Afro-Bahamians. Sometimes Bahamians use the term\u00a0Conchy Joe\u00a0to describe people of Anglo descent.<br \/>\nA small portion of the Euro-Bahamian population are\u00a0Greek Bahamians, descended from\u00a0Greek\u00a0labourers who came to help develop the sponging industry in the 1900s.\u00a0They make up less than 2% of the nation&#8217;s population, but have still preserved their distinct\u00a0Greek Bahamian\u00a0culture.<br \/>\n<strong>Religion.<\/strong>\u00a0Protestant\u00a080% (Baptists 35%,\u00a0Anglicans\u00a015%,\u00a0Pentecostals\u00a08%,\u00a0Church of God\u00a05%,\u00a0Seventh-day Adventists\u00a05% and\u00a0Methodists\u00a04%),\u00a0Roman Catholic\u00a0(14.5%), Other Christian (1.3%), Unaffiliated (3.1%), Other religion (1.1%).<br \/>\n<strong>Language. <\/strong>The\u00a0official language is English. Many people speak an\u00a0English-based creole language\u00a0called\u00a0Bahamian dialect or &#8220;Bahamianese&#8221;.\u00a0Haitian Creole, a\u00a0French-based creole language (25%) and is called Creole.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CULTURE<br \/>\n<\/strong>The culture of the islands is a mixture of African,\u00a0British\u00a0(as the former colonial power) and\u00a0American\u00a0(as the dominant country in the region and source of most tourists).<br \/>\nIn the less developed outer islands (or Family Islands), handicrafts include basketry made from palm fronds. This material, commonly called &#8220;straw&#8221;, is plaited into hats and bags that are popular tourist items.<br \/>\nJunkanoo\u00a0is a traditional Afro-Bahamian street parade of &#8216;rushing&#8217;, music, dance and art held in Nassau (and a few other settlements) every\u00a0Boxing Day\u00a0and\u00a0New Year&#8217;s Day. Junkanoo is also used to celebrate other holidays and events such as Emancipation Day.<br \/>\nRegattas\u00a0are important social events in many family island settlements. They usually feature one or more days of sailing by old-fashioned\u00a0workboats, as well as an onshore festival.<br \/>\nMany dishes are associated with\u00a0Bahamian cuisine, which reflects Caribbean, African and European influences. Some settlements have festivals associated with the traditional crop or food of that area, such as the &#8220;Pineapple Fest&#8221; in Gregory Town,\u00a0Eleuthera\u00a0or the &#8220;Crab Fest&#8221; on Andros. Other significant traditions include\u00a0storytelling.<br \/>\n<strong>Sport.<\/strong> The national sport is\u00a0cricket. The Bahamas are not eligible to play for the\u00a0West Indies cricket team. The late 1970s saw the game begin to decline as teachers were replaced by teachers from the United States. Today cricket is still enjoyed by a few locals and immigrants.<br \/>\nThe most popular spectator sports are American &#8211; basketball,\u00a0American football,\u00a0and baseball,<br \/>\n==============================================================<\/p>\n<p>Bahamas \u2013 Grand Bahama (Freeport), Bimini, Berry, Great Abaco<br \/>\n<strong><em>Tentative WHS: <\/em><\/strong>Historic Lighthouses of Bahamas<br \/>\n<strong><em>Islands<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong><strong>BIMINI<br \/>\n<em>World of Nature: <\/em><\/strong>Bimini Mangrove Forests<br \/>\n<strong><em>Villages and Small Towns: <\/em><\/strong>Alice Town<\/p>\n<p><strong>GRAND BAHAMA<br \/>\nFREEPORT<br \/>\n<em>Botanical Gardens: <\/em><\/strong>Freeport: Garden of the Groves<br \/>\n<strong><em>Castles, Palaces, Forts: <\/em><\/strong>Freeport: Cooper&#8217;s Castle<br \/>\n<strong><em>World of Nature: <\/em><\/strong>Lucayan NP<br \/>\n<strong><em>Caves and Sinkholes: <\/em><\/strong>Lucayan National Park Caves<\/p>\n<p><strong>GREAT ABACO<br \/>\n<em>World of Nature: <\/em><\/strong>Abaco NP<br \/>\n<strong><em>History, Culture, National and City Museums: <\/em><\/strong>Green Turtle Cay: Albert Lowe Museum<br \/>\n<strong><em>History, Culture, National and City Museums: <\/em><\/strong>Hope Town: Wyannie Malone Museum<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Airports<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Freeport (FPO)<br \/>\nMarsh Harbour (MHH)<br \/>\nSouth Bimini (BIM)<br \/>\n<strong><em>World of Nature: <\/em><\/strong>Walker&#8217;s Cay NP<br \/>\n<strong><em>Beaches<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Half Moon Cay<br \/>\nPig Beach<br \/>\n<strong><em>Experiences<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Junkanoo<br \/>\n<strong><em>Lighthouses<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Great Isaac Cay Lighthouse<br \/>\nHope Town Lighthouse (Elbow Reef LH)<\/p>\n<p><strong>COVID<\/strong> (Published 07.02.2022 IATA Travel Centre)<br \/>\n1.
