It shares land borders with India to the west, north, and east, and Myanmar to the southeast; to the south, it has a coastline along the Bay of Bengal. It is narrowly separated from Bhutan and Nepal by the Siliguri Corridor; and from China by the Indian state of Sikkim in the north. Dhaka, the capital and largest city, is the nation&#8217;s political, financial and cultural centre. Chittagong, the second-largest city, is the busiest port on the Bay of Bengal. The official language is Bengali, one of the easternmost branches of the Indo-European language family.<br \/>\nBangladesh forms the sovereign part of the historic and\u00a0ethnolinguistic\u00a0region of\u00a0Bengal, which was divided during the\u00a0Partition of India in 1947. The country has a\u00a0Bengali Muslim majority. The\u00a0Muslim conquest of Bengal began in 1204. Under\u00a0Mughal rule, eastern Bengal continued to prosper as the melting pot of Muslims in the eastern subcontinent and attracted traders from around the world.<br \/>\nAfter the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, the\u00a01971 Bangladesh genocide\u00a0and the massacre of pro-independence Bengali civilians, including\u00a0intellectuals, the new state of Bangladesh was formed in 1972.<br \/>\nA middle power in the Indo-Pacific, Bangladesh is the second largest economy in South Asia. It maintains the third-largest military in the region and is a major contributor to UN peacekeeping operations. The large Muslim population of Bangladesh makes it the third-largest Muslim-majority country. It hosts one of the largest refugee populations in the world due to the Rohingya genocide. Bangladesh faces many challenges, particularly corruption and the effects of climate change.<br \/>\nBangladesh as a vacation land has many facets. Her tourist attractions include archaeological sites, historic mosques and monuments, resorts, beaches, picnic spots, forests and wildlife and unforgettable experiences that remain relatively unknown to the rest of the world.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Capital.<\/strong> Dhaka<br \/>\n<strong>Official Language.<\/strong> Bengali.

I mistakenly filled out the Visa application online that wasn&#8217;t necessary. I missed the VOA counter on the right and waited in line for a half hour in the normal line along with about 1000 others, the longest lineup in the world and the most passport types in the world (citizen, expatriate, foreign, diplomatic).<br \/>\nRequirements. Pay US$51. Fill out a short form. List accommodation, arrival flight, exit flight (I had made a fake flight as I didn&#8217;t know when I was going to leave) and Covid<br \/>\nvaccination status.<br \/>\n<em>At immigration, my visa said Mar 16 (even though it was a 30-day visa, at entry when asked how long I was staying, I said 10 days and she put it on my visa!!!) I was supposed to pay a fine but the officer let me off and then stamped in the centre of a page. I learned another lesson here.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>SIM card.<\/strong> Easy at the airport 800T ($7.50) for 12 gigs and 15 days. Registration and activation are very fast.<br \/>\n<strong>Transportation. <\/strong>Getting around is difficult as there are no traffic lights (major intersections have police directing traffic) and the only right of way is if you can edge ahead of the next guy. With no police control, every intersection becomes a quagmire of a few vehicles getting across before the next lane edges into the fray. Prices are very cheap except if you are renting a car. Horning is common and used to warn people and also get them out of the way.<br \/>\n<em>Rickshaw.<\/em> I haven&#8217;t seen these since Kolkata India but they are easily the most common way to get around and there are millions of them &#8211; this is possible as Bangladesh is so flat as any hill makes a rickshaw very difficult. They are of two types &#8211; bicycle (these also serve as the major freight hauling method and are a significant impediment to traffic flow as they carry enormous loads). and motor with an electric battery. Very cheap.<br \/>\n<em>Tuk-tuk.<\/em> It&#8217;s also very common but more expensive.<br \/>\n<em>Share van.<\/em> There are a few of these driving-specific routes.<br \/>\n<em>Motorcycles. <\/em>These are the most efficient as they have speed and can edge into traffic better and get around other vehicles. Easily the best way to get around Dhaka. Uber has a motorcycle option that is 1\/10 the price of a car.<br \/>\n<em>Renting a scooter<\/em> also seemed hard as they wanted a lot of info &#8211; Uber image, NID, DL. I tried using Chaad in Dhaka, went a long way to their office on the 9th floor of an office building, waited 30 minutes and no one arrived. I think I could have managed although Old Town Dhaka may have been a challenge, as many areas have little traffic.<br \/>\n<em>Taxi.<\/em> Use Uber, a very efficient booking system and cheap. Motorcycles are much cheaper and tons more efficient than cars.<br \/>\n<em>Bus.<\/em> Dhaka public buses have great difficulty negotiating around because of their size. I have never seen such beat-up vehicles. They seem to ply major routes. I rarely use these as they are hard to figure out.<br \/>\n<em>Intercity bus.<\/em> Use Shohos.com, a group booking site to access all bus companies (in Dhaka, each company seemed to have its terminal but on the other sites, most buses are found together in one large terminal &#8211; much easier), my first bus was deluxe &#8220;sleeper&#8221; seat for 1400 T to Khulna, very nice, just like Brazil, but the second long bus was ordinary.<br \/>\nBuses tend to be faster than trains as they stop much less often. Roads outside cities are not busy.<br \/>\n<em>Car.<\/em> It appears that renting a car without a driver is not possible in Bangladesh, just like in Pakistan. To go anywhere out of the way means hiring a private car and driver which gets expensive as hotels book through tour agencies, much more than renting a car. And these drivers are nothing special. About $38 for a 2-hour drive.<br \/>\n<em>Train.<\/em> I thought one must register on the Bangladesh Railways to take any trip but one can buy the ticket on the train. There is a foreigner option. I tried at least 10 times but never could get the OTP (verification code) to finish the registration process (the phone number worked perfectly well every other time I used it for other things so I knew it was correct, I even &#8220;borrowed&#8221; other people&#8217;s numbers to get the OTP but they didn&#8217;t work either), and even went up to the tech guy in an office whose solution was to get a new SIM. So I erroneously resigned myself to using buses or flying.<br \/>\n<em>Plane.<\/em> There are three domestic carriers with varying destinations. Note that some don&#8217;t have daily flights but all fly via Dhaka.<br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Novo Air.<\/span> My favourite. Flies daily to all 8 airports in Bangladesh and Kolkata internationally.<br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Biman.<\/span> Domestic flights to 8 airports and many international destinations.<br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">US Bangla<\/span>. Flies to all 8 domestic airports and many international destinations but no daily.<br \/>\n<strong>Hours:<\/strong> Thursday and Friday are holidays. Most things open at 3 pm on Fridays. The National Museum, the Art and the Liberation Museum in Dhaka are closed on both days.<br \/>\n<strong>Mosques.<\/strong> The Tara and Chawkbazar Shahi mosques in Dhaka are as pretty as any mosques in the world. Can&#8217;t enter with shorts (but I have zip-on legs). All have large ablution areas that are actively used. Islam here has strong rules.<br \/>\n<strong>Food.<\/strong> Most street food is pretty good (not as good as Pakistan) with pakoras, dahl roti, and many others I don&#8217;t know the names of. A lot have potato +\/- vegetables in dough and deep fried. In Khulna, there was a crispy deep-fried shell filled with a veg puree, topped with onion and cilantro and served with a thin &#8220;sauce&#8221; that was truly delicious.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Some Observations about Bangladesh<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>1. People.<\/strong> There are a lot of them in this high-density population country. There were many women with no hijab (head scarf) as this is a secular country where women have a choice. I initially thought they were Hindu but apparently, women have complete freedom about how they dress and most were Muslim, many attractive. Maybe the ugly ones were wearing hijabs? I find Muslim women in hijab and long outfits very unattractive &#8211; and intentionally made that way so men don&#8217;t look at them. There is cultural pressure to wear all this stuff &#8211; the Muslim community, their families and husbands. After they have had children, most are fat and get very out of shape. Hindus can be identified as the ones with a bindi (red dot on forehead) and a white bangle on their writs.<br \/>\nThere are a few beggars, all Muslim, some very old but most young women with infants or kids living on the sidewalks. The kids are taught to beg. One of the five tenets of Islam is charity to the poor and they seem to see me as a walking bank.<br \/>\nMuslim teenagers around my hotel dressed very modern &#8211; no hijab, long hair (often to their knees), arms showing. I didn&#8217;t know Muslims could be so attractive.<br \/>\nEveryone stares at me, sometimes for a long time. I stand out with my white skin and shorts but my blue eyes are a real attraction. I didn&#8217;t see white folks until Khulna where a Belgian old man and a group of Americans visiting an American agricultural consultant who has lived in Bangladesh for 34 years.<br \/>\nMany of the older men going grey dye their hair but most use a weird orange dye in the hair and beards that looks atrocious.<br \/>\nThe men I have dealt with are kind and generous, some of the nicest people anywhere. I had great help from two motorcycle drivers. Unlike India, people don&#8217;t come up and ask for photos. Women never talk to you.<br \/>\nMany men smoke but buy only one at a time, buying from the numerous vendors who are surprised when you buy a whole pack (about $3).<br \/>\n<strong>2. Corruption.<\/strong> Bangladesh in 2020 was becoming an economic marvel with 7% growth but inept politicians (especially involving the 75-year-old president) and corruption are hampering progress. Bangladesh has the highest GDP\/per person of any other South Asia country.<br \/>\nMy trip to the Sundarbans was a case in point. The tour operator said that the boat would cost 2000T &#8211; it was 4000 at the boat. He said I would be given a boat number and the boat skipper would expect me &#8211; nothing was arranged and I arranged it all myself. The cost of the driver was supposed to be 500T but ended up being 4500! and everyone expected a tip.<br \/>\n<strong>3. Mosquitos <\/strong>are everywhere, especially at the airport (the terminal is even full of them). They come out at dusk and last all night. They find you on the 5th floor of your hotel room. It is impossible to buy DEET-containing repellents as it seems Bangladeshis don&#8217;t trust it (despite being proven to be very safe). Everyone sleeps under a mosquito net..<br \/>\n<strong>4. Islam and being a Muslim.<\/strong> Bangladesh is very secular tolerating all religions. I don&#8217;t see people praying all over the place but only in mosques. It is complicated but there is a big difference between Islam and how it is practiced daily.<br \/>\nFew B Muslims have more than one wife and most don&#8217;t aspire to more than one. Opi, a fellow I met in Rajshahi, was married for one year to a woman he had been in a great relationship but they had never been sexually active in all that time. He said they were unusual and most couples are sexually active before marriage.<br \/>\nWomen are free to wear hijab or not. Opi&#8217;s wife does so that men don&#8217;t sexually look at her. About a third wear veils. Russel, my driver, wants his wife to ninja.<br \/>\nThere is a real double standard everywhere with a lot of sexual hypocrisy. Men are often very sexually active before marriage but use prostitutes.<br \/>\n<strong>5. Rice.<\/strong> Bangladesh is perfect for rice as it is so flat. It is everywhere with crops in all stages of growth. They can plant 4 crops per year. They eat it for every meal. There are ponds and canals everywhere with pumps to water the fields.<br \/>\n<strong>6. Weather.<\/strong> In my 10 days in Bangladesh, there was zero rain and very warm temperatures averaging 35\u00b0C. Smog though makes for grey skies. The entire South Asia region has been in a usual heat wave (it was about the same in Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore. But humidity has been low and the temperature very tolerable.<br \/>\n<strong>7. Costs.<\/strong> Two things are relatively expensive in Bangladesh: hotels I have stayed at start at ~2000 and range to 3600 (US$20-36) and renting cars. Other things like food (street food dinner $1), and rides on rickshaws (30 cents) are very cheap.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 1<\/strong> Tue Mar 7<br \/>\n<strong>GREATER DHAKA (Jamalpur)<\/strong><br \/>\n<em>Flight.<\/em> Bangkok &#8211; Dhaka (DAC) Air Asia 23:00 &#8211; 01:00 arriving on the 7th; 132CA$<br \/>\n<em>The airport area is a haven for mosquitos as it is surrounded by swamps. I got 5 bites on the bus ride from the plane to the terminal and had to wear a mosquito headnet during my sleep as there were also a lot in the airport. I slept well at the airport during departures but was woken up by a lot of noise at 5 am as I was next to the check-in counters.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>I tried unsuccessfully to get an Uber and finally settled on a tuk-tuk to take me 4.8 km to the Uttara Metro Station. It was closed as it was a &#8220;metro holiday&#8221;!! I then took an Uber the 21 km to my booked hotel, most at a snail&#8217;s pace as he was very slow, non-aggressive and because of the traffic as it neared my hotel 700T (about $6.50, very cheap for a taxi).\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>My booked hotel Shah Alam Villas (villas is the greatest misnomer in the world as it was a dank apartment building squeezed between several others) was down a tiny lane and only merchants within 10 m of the entrance knew where it was. The owner was there and apologized as it was not open due to renovation (he had not paid any attention to the Booking.com website for a while) and his phone number didn&#8217;t work as he lost his phone a week ago. He was extremely nice, spoke fluent English (lab tech), took me for brunch of parotta, egg and coffee and found another hotel.<br \/>\nI took a motor rickshaw the 2.8 km (50 cents) to my new hotel.<br \/>\n<\/em>ON Embassy Inn Hotel. A cheap place with a reception on the third floor. Single room with bath 2130 T but I paid 2000. With A\/C and a fan, a good bed, no refrigerator, and no means of getting hot water. On the 4th floor so good exercise. Many food choices nearby including an expensive Burger King. A small place around the corner has great food (chilli chicken is great).

Dhaka ranks\u00a0third in South Asia and 39th in the world\u00a0in terms of urban GDP. Lying on the\u00a0Ganges Delta, it is bounded by the\u00a0Buriganga,\u00a0Turag,\u00a0Dhaleshwari\u00a0and\u00a0Shitalakshya\u00a0rivers. Dhaka is also the largest\u00a0Bengali-speaking\u00a0city in the world.<br \/>\nThe area of Dhaka has been inhabited since the first millennium. An early modern city developed in the 17th century as a provincial capital and commercial centre of the Mughal Empire. Dhaka was the capital of a proto-industrialised Mughal Bengal for 75 years (1608\u201339 and 1660\u20131704). It was the hub of the muslin trade in Bengal and one of the most prosperous cities in the world. The pre-colonial city&#8217;s glory peaked in the 17th and 18th centuries when it was home to merchants from across Eurasia. The Port of Dhaka was a major trading post for both riverine and seaborne trade. The Mughals decorated the city with well-laid gardens, tombs, mosques, palaces and forts. Under British rule, the city saw the introduction of electricity, railways, cinemas, Western-style universities and colleges and a modern water supply. It became an important administrative and educational centre in the British Raj, as the capital of Eastern Bengal and Assam province after 1905. In 1947, after the end of British rule, the city became the administrative capital of East Pakistan. It was declared the legislative capital of Pakistan in 1962. In 1971, after the Liberation War, it became the capital of independent Bangladesh.<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-ReferenceC_29-0\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>A\u00a0beta-global city, <sup id=\"cite_ref-30\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>Dhaka is the centre of political, economic and cultural life in Bangladesh.<br \/>\nThe city&#8217;s culture is known for its\u00a0rickshaws, biryani,\u00a0art festivals\u00a0and religious diversity.

It was supposed to open at 9, I arrived at 9:45 and waited until 10:15, but they didn&#8217;t appear and I left to see Dhaka by rickshaw or motorcycle taxi. I walked to the first two. All the distances between sites seemed to be 1-2.5 km between so walking a lot is not very practical.<br \/>\n<\/em><strong>Liberation War Museum <\/strong>was established in 1996 to commemorate the heroic struggle of the Bengali nation for their democratic and national rights. The struggle turned into an armed conflict following the genocide unleashed by the military rulers of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and culminated with the emergence of Bangladesh as a secular, democratic state in December 1971.<br \/>\nHindu-Muslim communal tensions fanned by the British colonial rulers to perpetuate their hold on India led to the partition of India in 1947. Pakistan was created as a separate homeland for Muslims. This unnatural separation of the Bengali society based on religion created deep fissures in a society \u2013 which had hitherto had a pluralistic character. The Province of East Pakistan was physically separated from West Pakistan by a thousand miles. Pakistan therefore, was an unrealistic and dysfunctional state from the very beginning. The Pakistani ruling elite controlled by the military elite subjugated the Bengalis politically, culturally and economically and therefore the disillusionment with the new nation was not surprising. In the first-ever national Parliamentary elections held in 1970 based on a one-man-one-vote basis, the Bengali nationalist forces led by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman won a landslide victory and his party, the Awami League became the majority party of Pakistan as a whole, and by democratic norms, was expected to form the new government. However, in an attempt to crush this nationalistic movement, the Pakistani Military Junta unleashed a systematic genocide against the Bengali people on the fateful night of March 25, 1971. The Junta received support only from a handful of religion-based local parties and religious fundamentalists. The Pakistani rampage in the nine months of 1971 resulted in the worst genocide since the Second World War, an estimated 3 million people was killed, some 278,000 women were raped and 10 million had to take refuge in neighbouring India. A government in exile was quickly formed and the resistance started becoming more and more co-ordinated. Young people from the villages and students took military training and the Mukti Bahini (freedom fighters) started fighting back the occupation forces divided into 11 Sectors, adopting guerilla tactics and keeping the Pakistani army in a harassed and indefensible state. By September these half-trained young men had infiltrated deep inside Bangladesh and a large part of the country was virtually self-ruled. On December 3, after Pakistan attacked and bombed airfields in the western part of India, the Allied Command of the Indian Army and the Muktibahini (Bangladesh Freedom Fighters) was formed and they started the formal armed assault. On December 16, 1971, the Pakistani Armed Forces ignominiously surrendered to this Allied Command and independent Bangladesh was born as a democratic and secular state.<br \/>\nMuseum displays include rare photographs, documents, electronic and print media and materials used by freedom fighters and martyrs of the Liberation War.<br \/>\n<em>I stopped at a tiny restaurant for an excellent dahl + fried egg with roti.

The density of Islamic religious monuments is explained by the piety of Khan Jahan. The lack of fortifications is attributable to the possibility of retreating into the impenetrable mangrove swamps of the Sundarbans. The quality of the infrastructures &#8211; the supply and evacuation of water, the cisterns and reservoirs, the roads and bridges &#8211; all reveal a perfect mastery of planning and a will towards spatial organization.<br \/>\nThe Mosque City of Bagerhat preserves all the necessary elements &#8211; mosques, residences, roads, ancient ponds, tombs, and chilla khana (ancient graveyard) of a medieval Muslim town in the northern peripheral land of the Sundarbans.<br \/>\nMore than 50 monuments are divided into two zones 6.5 km apart: There are only two monuments to see:<br \/>\n<strong>The M<\/strong><em><strong>osque of Shait-Gumbad\u00a0<\/strong><\/em> (Shait-Gumbad (Sixty Dome Mosque) is one of the largest mosques and represents the flavour of the traditional orthodox mosque plan and it is the only example of its kind in the whole of Bengal.

In front of me was a tiny stand selling a round crispy pastry with a bean paste, cilantro, onions and a thin sauce that was very delicious 30 T (27 cents).

I knew where I would be coming tomorrow night.<br \/>\nOn my walk about, I passed two crews pouring cement for large slabs. To feed the two mixers, there were two crews of 8 men, four on each to shovel and four to carry either sand or gravel in small round baskets on their heads (had thick &#8220;hats&#8221; to cushion the load). Water dripped out of the baskets and the carriers were covered in dirt. One other carried bags of cement. It was hard back-breaking work and would make anyone want to pursue an education to avoid it.

The driver was quoted as costing 500T but I realized that this amount was ridiculously low for an hour&#8217;s drive each way plus waiting time there. It ended up that the tour company that this was arranged through was completely fraudulent as all prices were low, not realistic.<br \/>\n<\/em><strong>The Sundarbans.<\/strong> World Heritage Site 1987. The Sundarbans mangrove forest, located in the southwest of Bangladesh between the river Baleswar in the East and the Harinbanga in the West, adjoining the Bay of Bengal, is the largest contiguous mangrove forest in the world. 60% lies in Bangladesh and the rest in India&#8217;s Sundarbans World Heritage site. The land area, including exposed sandbars, occupies 414,259 ha (70%) with water bodies covering 187,413 ha (30%). It is the delta of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers.<br \/>\nThe site is intersected by a complex network of tidal waterways, mudflats and small islands of salt-tolerant mangrove forests, and presents an excellent example of ongoing ecological processes. The area is known for its exceptional biodiversity and wide range of fauna, including 260 bird species, the Bengal tiger (400 to 450 individuals, a higher density than any other population of tigers in the world),\u00a0 estuarine crocodile, Indian python, Ganges and Irawadi dolphins, and the critically endangered endemic river terrapin (Batagur baska). 334 plant species, 693 species of wildlife which includes; 49 mammals, 59 reptiles, 8 amphibians, 210 white fishes, 24 shrimps, 14 crabs and 43 mollusks species. 315 species of waterfowl, raptors and forest birds including nine species of kingfisher and the magnificent white-bellied sea eagle.<br \/>\nMonsoon rains, flooding, delta formation, tidal influence and plant colonization represent the process of delta formation from sediments deposited by the three great rivers.<br \/>\nThe three wildlife sanctuaries in the south are core breeding areas for a number of endangered species. It is in reality a mosaic of islands of different shapes and sizes, perennially washed by brackish water shrilling in and around the endless and mind-boggling labyrinths of water channels.<br \/>\n<em>It took an hour to drive to Mongla. On arrival, there was no boat arranged and I had to haggle the price which turned out to be 3000 T. There is no opportunity to join other people&#8217;s trips &#8211; of which there are many. I got on the small rust-bucket boat with a very congenial skipper, an older guy with an orange beard who liked to sing. It took about 30 minutes on the very wide river full of freight boats to reach the park and the mangroves. I have seen mangroves many times before. They are an ecological wonder but not very interesting &#8211; at low tide their roots are exposed. These were unusual in that the trees were much taller than the ones I had seen before. We went along the shore for about 20 minutes seeing the same scene &#8211; bush, before we arrived at the first &#8220;village&#8221; where a narrow canal joined the river. There were many boats and people as this is a popular trip but little to see &#8211; some nice houses and gazebos but little of interest. I got off and was immediately accosted by a &#8220;park ranger&#8221; who wanted me to pay the 575 T permit fee to visit the village. I immediately turned around and reboarded. What was the point?\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>To go up the canal required a permit of 2700 so we returned to Mongla.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>Just past the park is a village and houses built on the water on stilts. Next was a row of metal shacks he called Santa Maria and asked if I wanted &#8220;tikki-tikki&#8221;. There were girls outside and many young guys taking advantage of the brothel. In these Muslim countries where the opportunity for sex is limited before marriage, brothels are very popular. There is quite a double standard, both in the religion and the sexism.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>We finally got back to Mongla with a total trip time of 1 1\/2 hours, enough for me. I would have happily done more if there was an opportunity to see wildlife but we didn&#8217;t see a bird on the way there so I thought that unlikely and seeing a tiger next to impossible.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>I bought some potato dumplings, cucumber and coke while I waited for the driver who didn&#8217;t expect me this early.<br \/>\nWhen we got back to the hotel and it was time to pay, the price became 4500T!!, not an unreasonable amount, but I paid 4ooo because of all the lies from the tour operator.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nDivisional Museum.<\/strong> Just 100 m from my hotel, this has archaeology, history and ethnography like most regional museums. 100 T<br \/>\n<em>My next big decision was what to do next. There was no bus to Rahshahi or possibility of a train and the only way there was to fly. US Banglia, a domestic airline had daily flights but they left from Jessore, 75 km away by private car. left at 07:00 and entailed a 9-hour layover at Dhaka Airport.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>So I decided to take a bus back to Dhaka and then onward to <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span class=\"text-left text-region\">Chittagong with a plan to see that and then continue to Northern Dhaka province and the NW province of Bangladesh.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 6<\/strong> Sun Mar 12<br \/>\n<em>Up early, I had BF with 4 Americans, one a 34-year resident of Bangladesh who works as a consultant in the agriculture industry.

It is a rattletrap bus but I have a front window seat and enjoyed the view across the south of the country, endless rice paddies being cut with a sickle, many ponds, dusty villages, some logging, trees. Instead of going the &#8220;north&#8221; route on a 4-lane divided highway through Dhaka, this went south on a two-lane road, had regular stops and was driven by a madman constantly on the horn. There is almost no traffic but many electric rickshaws, so he maintains a good speed. This route is much more up-close and personal.<br \/>\n<\/em>We eventually hit a 4-lane divided toll expressway.<br \/>\n<strong>Padma Multipurpose Bridge<\/strong>. Over the Padma River at its narrowest part, this is very high and long, a big sand island is on the north side.

The bus ran into another bus, bending the right mirror &#8211; the kid on the bus climbed up and pulled it straight and with the electric control gone, straightened the glass so that he could use the mirror &#8211; all good!. The bus had no AC so it got pretty warm depending on a fan and open window (I was lucky to be on the non-sunny left side).<br \/>\n<strong>Meghna Bridge.<\/strong> Over the Meghna River, it is not that long.<br \/>\nThe broken mirror swung out with the wind &#8211; they tied a bunch of rags together and secured the straightened mirror to the base of the windshield wiper, took 1 minute but the wind stretched the fabric &#8220;rope&#8221; so that tightened it again!<br \/>\nWe stopped for lunch and eventually arrived in Chittagong at about 18:00 making for a 9-hour drive. It was 35\u00b0. I got off close to my hotel (I had no reservation).<br \/>\nAt 9 I went out to eat. With many small shops selling convenience store items, fruit and veg, there was no street food and only one cafe with food I was not interested in. I eventually found one small stand with one of my favourites &#8211; the small round crisps filled with bean paste and topped with onion\/cilantro.<br \/>\nON Patra Flagship Chittagong City Centre, I splurged for once on a nice hotel and this is lovely.

A controversial shipbreaking industry on the outskirts of the city, which supplies local steel but causes pollution, has come under international scrutiny.<br \/>\nPortuguese Chittagong was the first European colonial settlement in Bengal. A naval battle in 1666 between the Mughal Empire and Arakan resulted in the expulsion of Portuguese pirates. British colonization began in 1760 when the Nawab of Bengal ceded Chittagong to the East India Company. During World War II, Chittagong was a base for Allied Forces engaged in the Burma Campaign. The port city began to expand and industrialize during the 1940s, particularly after the Partition of British India.<br \/>\nChittagong has a high degree of religious and ethnic diversity among Bangladeshi cities, despite having an overwhelming\u00a0Bengali Muslim\u00a0majority: Bengali Hindus, Bengali Christians, Bengali Buddhists, the Chakmas, the Marmas and the Bohmong.<br \/>\nChittagong Airport (CGP)<br \/>\n<em>Cox&#8217;s Bazar was 148 km and 3 1\/2 hours south with only the longest beach in the world (120 km) to see.

St. Martin&#8217;s Island has become a tourist spot, and five shipping liners run daily trips to the island.<br \/>\nSeveral endangered turtles nest plus corals,<br \/>\nIt is possible to walk around the island in a day because it measures only 8\u00a0km<sup>2<\/sup> (3 sq. miles), shrinking to about 5\u00a0km<sup>2<\/sup>\u00a0(2 sq. mi) during high tide. The island exists only because of its coral base, so removal of that coral risks erosion of the beach. Because of this, St. Martin&#8217;s has lost roughly 25% of its coral reef in the past seven years.<br \/>\nFishing is one of the largest professional activities of its 5,500 residents but territorial disputes between Myanmar and Bangladesh have resulted in violence, often targeting unarmed Bangladeshi fishermen.<br \/>\nThe best weather is usually between November and February, the major tourist season.

Located to the north-west of Bangladesh in the district of Naogaon, the heart-land of ancient \u201cVarendra\u201d, close to the village of Paharpur the extensive ruins of the Buddhist monastic complex are the most spectacular and important pre-Islamic monument in Bangladesh.<br \/>\nThe first builder of the monastery was Dharmapala Vikramshila (770-810AD), the king of Varendri-Magadha. It is a large square quadrangle 231 x 240 metres, with the main entrance, and an elaborate structure, on the northern side. The outer walls of the monastery are formed by rows of cells that face inwards toward the main shrine in the centre of the courtyard. In the last building phases of the Monastery these cells, which formed the outer wall, totalled 177. Each cell is 4.26 x 4.11 m and was initially a living space for monks but later used for worship and meditation.<br \/>\nThe main central shrine has a cruciform ground plan and a terraced superstructure that rises in three terraces above ground level to a height of about 70 feet. The upper level is a massive rectangular central block which forms the central brick shaft. The intermediate terrace is a wide circumambulatory path which passes four main chapels or <em>mandapas<\/em>, a simple cruciform elaborated with a series of projections at the re-entrants, a form that is copied at all levels on the main shrine. At the intermediate level, there were originally two bands of terracotta plaques running around the full perimeter of the shrine, out of which half are still preserved in situ. These are the most interesting parts of the site as the bas-reliefs seem all different and very interesting &#8211; people in all poses (including standing on their heads) and many animals &#8211; snakes, cobras, elephants and even giraffes. The entire base of both the bottom and intermediate terrace has a row of plaques.<br \/>\nThe cultural and religious life of this great Vihara was closely linked with the contemporary Buddhist centres of fame and history at Bodhgaya and Nalanda, many Buddhist treatises were completed at Paharpur, a centre where the Vajrayana trend of Mahayana Buddhism was practiced.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" title=\"Aerial view of Paharpur Buddhist Monastery (Somapura Mahavihara) \u2013 \u00a9 Peter Prix\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.elebase.io\/173fe953-8a63-4a8a-8ca3-1bacb56d78a5\/7c4eedaa-8c2d-4fd5-8fc7-c50903a05acf-paharpur-inline-01.jpg?q=75\" alt=\"Aerial view of Paharpur Buddhist Monastery (Somapura Mahavihara) \u2013 \u00a9 Peter Prix\" width=\"621\" height=\"435\" \/><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" title=\"The main temple of Paharpur was among the first temples with a cruciform (cross-shaped) design. \u2013 \u00a9 Peter Prix\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.elebase.io\/173fe953-8a63-4a8a-8ca3-1bacb56d78a5\/6407b9dd-0783-4392-8d23-8d146267d1a5-paharpur-inline-02.jpg?q=75\" alt=\"The main temple of Paharpur was among the first temples with a cruciform (cross-shaped) design. \u2013 \u00a9 Peter Prix\" width=\"621\" height=\"435\" \/><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"LazyImage_LazyImage__1YDAV LazyImage_isLoaded__3JO-C\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.britannica.com\/68\/178168-050-EED35840\/Somapura-Mahavira-Paharpur-Bangladesh.jpg\" width=\"619\" height=\"350\" \/><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" src=\"https:\/\/file.mofa.gov.bd\/media\/01e0df8b-6150-40b4-a75f-1e7a5b8c1f63\/uploaded-files\/site_0322_0007-500-334-20130227115220.jpg\" width=\"618\" height=\"413\" data-result=\"success\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It was then 16 km and 32 minutes north to see the next tentative WHS.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Jaggadala Vihara.<\/strong> Tentative WHS (17\/02\/1999).

I could not have done better than with Russel, a very competent driver and a super nice guy. The original quote was 7000T. I asked about how much gas was (4500T) so I paid him 12,000.

I hired him to take me to Panam City (38 km) and then to my hotel (27 km). I didn&#8217;t know immediately that he couldn&#8217;t read but communication became hard and he wasn&#8217;t a good listener. He insisted on going through a heavy traffic area and it was initially very slow. It eventually took 1&#8217;45&#8221;.<br \/>\n<\/em><strong>Panam City <\/strong>in Sonargaon was the site of the 13th-century Hindu capital city of Sonargaon. It was part of the Muslim metropolis that developed on the south of the old city as the residence of the early Muslim governors of the Sultanate of Bengal from 1338.<br \/>\nAfter the Mughal conquest in 1610, Panam was connected to the ruling metropolis by highways and bridges which still exist. They indicate that it was the suburban area of a medieval city.<br \/>\nOne of the earliest cities in Bangladesh that is still standing, the metropolis area once covered roughly 20 square kilometres (7.7 sq mi), but all that significantly remains are these 54 historical buildings. Other Mughal monuments from the original city include Sonakanda River Fort, the Panch Pir Mazar Shrine, and Ibrahim&#8217;s and Abdul Hamid&#8217;s Mosque. British colonial architecture preserved in Sonargaon includes the Ananda Mohan Piddar House and other street-front houses. For travellers making their way along the 2,500-kilometre-long (1,600 mi) Grand Trunk Road from Peshawar in the Hindu Kush, Sonargaon marked the end of the line.<br \/>\nIn the early 19<sup>th<\/sup> century, during colonial rule, Sonargaon developed into a trade centre for cotton fabrics, mainly English-piece goods. About 1400 Hindu and Muslim families were weavers in and around Panam. Then the British East India Company established its factory in Panam to purchase muslin and other cotton fabrics.<br \/>\nA group of wealthy Hindu merchants from Kolkata, then the capital of colonial India, returned to their ancestral land in Sonargaon and built a township in the area over an older ruined settlement establishing the new township of Panam Nagar (Panam City). The existing 54 buildings, the Hindu merchants\u2019 residents, date from the early 19<sup>th<\/sup> to the early 20<sup>th<\/sup> century. The city continued to flourish until the end of the WWII.<br \/>\nPanam Nagar was abandoned after a series of racial riots sparked during the Bengal Divide in 1947. The city was finally deserted after the Hindus migrated to India during the Indo-Pak War of 1965, making it an empty township. Although the buildings are now mostly in ruins, the historical city boasts architectural examples from the\u00a0Sultanate,\u00a0Mughal, and\u00a0British Colonial periods.<br \/>\nIn 2006, the World Monument Fund declared Panam Nagar one of its 100 historical ruins.<br \/>\nThreats to the site include flooding, vandalism, unauthorized occupation, illegal development etc. The historical buildings are becoming increasingly dilapidated with age and there are no signs of any significant restoration attempts.<br \/>\nWhat is visited now is a single street about 400 m long between two canals lined with 54 very attractive brick building ruins embellished with crests above doors, corinthian capitals, stone columns and some ancient tiles on one building. 100T<br \/>\n<strong>Bangladesh Folk Art &amp; Crafts Foundation.<\/strong> In an old structure, the Sardr Bari is a wonderful 2-story white building with porticos and columns sitting on the side of a pond.

More modern crafts include wood, brass, bamboo, metal, musical instruments, pottery, textiles, ornaments and much more. 100T<br \/>\n<strong>Sonakanda Fort.<\/strong> On the Shitalakshya River, the fort is one of three Mughal Empire forts in the area that date to 1650-70 built to defend Dhaka and Narayanganj from pirates. The 3-metre high defensive wall has many loopholes for guns and light cannons. The artillery platform held cannons of larger calibre. The quadrangular fort is 86 by 57 metres and has octagonal bastions on the four corners and a gate on the north side. 100T<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-qz2IHU63ACI\/VQU3-gtqCuI\/AAAAAAAAGD4\/TG7fj0Y-pR0\/s1600\/52_big.jpg\" alt=\"52_big.jpg (450\u00d7475)\" width=\"477\" height=\"503\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The 27 km drive to my hotel was much faster as most were on the expressway.
