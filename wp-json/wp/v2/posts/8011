Descent from Cond Peak to the southwest and then west (between Cond and Kokanee; see Cond Peak) presents no problem, but cliffs are present directly below the alps below Kokanee Peak.

Starting from the Gibson Lake car park at 9:00 am,\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">we followed the trail to its last switchback. From there, we made the usual approach toward Grays Pk., heading up a few hundred feet and then diagonally up and south toward the long southwest rib coming off Kokanee Pk. Along the way, we explored the lower of the two tailing dumps of the Molly Gibson Mine.<br \/>\nReaching our goal, a prominent grotty couloir on Kokanee\u2019s SSW side (you know you\u2019re in the right place when you can see a large yellow lichen stain high up on the right-hand wall of the gully), we ascended it some 150\u2019 before exiting left onto a paralleling rib. The bottom of this wide feature is somewhat shattered and broken, but the rock soon turns to very firm, lichened granite that is quite steep in places. Higher up, the rib narrows and the angle lessens as the ridge nears the base of the summit tower. In sum, the route offers pleasant, strenuous scrambling, with no need for the rope and ample hardware we had brought.<br \/>\nBy 1:00, we were on the summit, which we found breezy and cool as the sky started to go overcast after a mostly sunny morning. A check of the summit register revealed that there has been a total of six ascents (four of them this year, including ours) since my July 9, 1999 climb with Jim Kienholz and Eric Burton.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Descent was by the grotty couloir that we had started up. As this is a classic \u201cshit gully,\u201d care is needed. Retracing our steps at a leisurely pace to allow for sunbathing in the improving weather (this was October 19th!), we also explored the upper Molly Gibson tailing pile before descending to rejoin the trail. Back at the truck by 5:00 for an eight-hour day, we were pleased with a fine outing in wonderful weather, a fairly ambitious undertaking for so late in the season.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">We\u2019ll grade it this way: Kokanee Pk. 2790 m.
