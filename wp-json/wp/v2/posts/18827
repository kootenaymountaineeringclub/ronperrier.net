He became convinced that fasting can delay aging, prevent many illnesses that come along with growing older, and help more of us blow past age 100 by resetting our metabolism and cleaning out cellular debris. But few people will stick to a days-long fast, and extended fasting can cause muscle loss and other problems.<\/p>\n<p>So Longo spent years developing, testing, and fine-tuning a diet that tricks our bodies into responding as if we\u2019re eating nothing at all. It is very low in calories, sugars, and protein, and high in unsaturated fats.<\/p>\n<p>In experiments with middle-aged mice, Longo showed that a fasting-mimicking diet, or FMD, as he calls it, extends lifespan, revitalizes the immune system, and lowers the incidence of cancer. The diet also improved learning and memory in older mice, delayed cognitive decline in mice bred to develop Alzheimer\u2019s, and improved the efficacy of cancer treatment.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--below-paragraph InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\" data-bumper-index=\"2\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/fd4afb13-0a2b-4f2f-9fdc-c969675f634d\/MM9164_220625_04304.jpg?w=2303.9999389648438&amp;h=1537.1999592781067\" alt=\"Man receiving health checkup.\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">Domenico Calisti, 59, visits nutritionist Antonella Pellegrino and undergoes a health check as part of Valter Longo\u2019s fasting-mimicking diet clinical trial in Varapodio.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<p>Longo packaged the fasting-mimicking diet into a food kit, which includes nutrient-rich crackers, olives, soup mixes, herbal tea, and supplements.

No other antiaging intervention comes close. These studies also demonstrate that extremely low-calorie diets significantly reduce the incidence of age-related diseases, especially cancer.<\/p>\n<p>Lab animals are typically fed only once or twice a day\u2014they don\u2019t watch Netflix and munch popcorn at all hours. For decades scientists overlooked the possibility that the hours without food might contribute to the health and longevity gains among calorie-restricted animals. Now it\u2019s apparent than\u00a0<i>when<\/i>\u00a0we eat may be more important for longevity than how much.<\/p>\n<p>In 2022, scientists at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC9262309\/\">reported the results of an elaborate four-year experiment\u00a0<\/a>tracking hundreds of mice over their whole lives. Automated feeders allowed some mice to eat as much as they wanted, while sharply reducing calories for others and allowing that group access to food on different schedules\u2014within a two-hour window, within 12 hours, around the clock, day vs. night. Calorie restriction alone increased the lifespan of the animals by 10 percent. Coupled with limiting chow time to two hours at night, peak activity time for mice, the diet extended their lifespan by 35 percent. That would translate into about 25 years, on average, for humans.<\/p>\n<p>It would take decades\u2014and thousands of volunteers with the superhuman discipline to adhere to a fasting regimen all that time\u2014to determine whether strictly limiting when we eat can give us so much more time on Earth. But the practice has clear upsides. A 2019\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ahajournals.org\/doi\/10.1161\/circ.140.suppl_1.11123\">study<\/a> followed 2,001 heart patients and found those who routinely fasted were much more likely to be alive four years after a common procedure, cardiac catheterization, compared with patients who never fasted, did it briefly, or stopped many years earlier.<\/p>\n<p>Researchers Rafael de Cabo of the National Institute on Aging and Mark P. Mattson of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nejm.org\/doi\/10.1056\/NEJMra1905136?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%2520%25200pubmed\">reviewed years of clinical trials of intermittent fasting<\/a>\u00a0and concluded that there is enough evidence of the health benefits that physicians should be trained on the subject and offer guidance to patients.<\/p>\n<p>Of course,\u00a0<i>what<\/i>\u00a0we eat matters, too. Researchers at the University of Bergen in Norway recently\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosmedicine\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pmed.1003889\">estimated\u00a0<\/a>that a 20-year-old who cuts out hamburgers, hot dogs, white bread, and other staples of the Western diet, and makes a habit of eating beans, lentils, whole grains, nuts, fruits, and vegetables could increase their life expectancy by up to 13 years. And as with exercise, it\u2019s never too late to start and reap the benefits.<\/p>\n<p>A 60-year-old could gain more than eight years, and an 80-year-old could add more than three years, the scientists say. They did not measure the impact of fasting on life expectancy. But Panda notes that in addition to the physiological changes induced by fasting, the discipline encourages better food choices and less snacking.<\/p>\n<p>There doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to following a 12- to 16-hour food-free interval nightly. In 2022, Panda and his colleagues\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cell.com\/cell-metabolism\/fulltext\/S1550-4131(22)00361-8\">published a study of 137 San Diego firefighters<\/a>, half of whom agreed to eat only within a 10-hour daily window for 12 weeks. In a region plagued by wildfires, Panda initially worried: What if 14 hours without food left a firefighter sluggish or fuzzy minded during an emergency?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat was the most scary part for us,\u201d he says. \u201cIf some participant is feeling weak, is not responding to a 911 call, is not getting into that fire engine within 60 seconds, that would be the end of the study.\u201d But performance didn\u2019t slip. Overall, the fasting group showed improvements in cholesterol and mental health, and cut back on alcohol. Those who had high blood pressure or high glucose at the start of the study saw their levels go down.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe bottom line is, many of the fasting protocols will have some benefit that\u2019s much better than not fasting at all,\u201d Panda says.<\/p>\n<h2><b>How fasting works<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Valter Longo directs the Longevity Institute at the University of Southern California and the Longevity and Cancer Program at the IFOM Institute of Molecular Oncology in Milan. He says his fasting-mimicking diet works in large part by activating blood stem cells, which strengthen the body\u2019s ability to produce infection-fighting white blood cells. It happens not during the FMD cycle but when normal eating resumes. The regimen also promotes a cellular cleansing process called autophagy: Cells devour their own damaged parts, which are replaced by functional components.<\/p>\n<p>In clinical trials, Longo has found that FMD switches the body from a sugar-burning mode to a fat-burning mode\u2014essentially reprogramming metabolism, which the modern Western diet has thrown out of whack. Studies of intermittent fasting have demonstrated a similar effect, which may explain why people with metabolic risk factors such as pre-diabetes appear to benefit most.<\/p>\n<p>Roughly 30 clinical trials around the world are testing FMD on people with cancer, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer\u2019s, kidney disease, high blood pressure, irritable bowel syndrome, \u201cand almost any disease you can think of,\u201d Longo says.<\/p>\n<p>A kit for Longo\u2019s five-day program is also available commercially, for close to $200. Longo says all his profits go to the Milan-based foundation that supports his research. Still, the price puts the package out of reach for many Americans, especially low-income people and people of color, who have disproportionately high rates of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not scalable,\u201d Panda says. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to help half of the population in the U.S. who actually need this approach. They cannot afford it. They cannot even afford food, healthy food.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I wondered why Valter Longo decided to bring a new way of eating to a region of Italy famous for centenarians and healthy traditional fare. \u201cNowadays, not a lot of people follow this diet,\u201d says Romina Cervigni, scientific officer at Longo\u2019s foundation. Roughly\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.istat.it\/it\/archivio\/234930\">one-third\u00a0<\/a>of children and adolescents in Calabria are overweight, one of the highest rates in Italy. Sixty-one percent of residents ages 65 and older have high blood pressure, 29 percent have heart disease, and 24 percent have diabetes, with the rates shooting up as people reach their late 70s and 80s, according to the chronic disease surveillance system set up by the Italian Ministry of Health.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe hope the study will improve life for a new generation,\u201d says Orlando Fazzolari, the mayor of Varapodio.<\/p>\n<p>Longo and his team are recruiting volunteers who are overweight and have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high blood sugar, or other metabolic risk factors. The researchers will randomly sort people into three groups. One will eat normally, switching to the fasting-mimicking regimen for five days three times\u2014at the start of the study, three months later, and three months after that.<\/p>\n<p>The second group will follow the same FMD schedule and the rest of the time, they\u2019ll eat what he calls \u201cthe longevity diet.\u201d It\u2019s nearly vegan, except for some fish, and ideally consumed within a 12-hour daily window. The final group will serve as controls, changing nothing about their diet. The study will measure changes in body mass index, numerous biological markers, and biological aging.<\/p>\n<p>At the end of six months, Longo will invite the control group to switch to the longevity diet. Years of research have taught him that when people volunteer for a study and wind up getting nothing that might boost their health, they often feel cheated. The study takes place in villages with a couple thousand residents, at most, and everybody knows one another. He doesn\u2019t want people in the control group to complain: Why did my cousin get the diet, and not I?<\/p>\n<h2><b>Calorie restriction in a pill<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>No antiaging intervention tested by scientists\u2014and they\u2019ve investigated hundreds\u2014has had stronger, more consistent effects than calorie restriction. It boosts the lifespan of rodents by\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s42003-018-0024-8\">up to 50 percent<\/a>. Rhesus monkeys\u2014closer to us than mice, genetically speaking\u2014also benefit. In one study, researchers\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/10.1126\/science.1173635\">slashed the daily calorie intake of rhesus monkeys by 30 percent\u00a0<\/a>for their entire adult lives, without skimping on nutrients. Those animals not only lived longer than monkeys fed standard fare, they also were less likely to develop diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and the brain shrinkage that often comes with old age.<\/p>\n<p>In humans, eating the bare minimum for survival might prevent or delay some ailments, but over the long term it would cause other problems, such as bone loss. Even if the practice was safe, many of us might not think a longer life worth living if it meant walking around hungry all the time.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/jp.senescence.info\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jo\u00e3o Pedro de Magalh\u00e3es<\/a>, a professor of molecular biogerontology at the University of Birmingham in England, feels that way.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m terrible when I\u2019m hungry,\u201d he says. \u201cI get very grumpy. So the question is, could we develop a way of getting the benefits of the health effects and longevity effects of calorie restriction without having to go on a diet? That\u2019s something that, for decades, people have dreamed about.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Now his lab has taken a step toward finding an answer. In a series of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2021.10.13.464294v1\">experiments<\/a>, de Magalh\u00e3es and his colleagues showed that a prescription blood pressure medication, rilmenidine, extends the lifespan of the worm\u00a0<i>C. elegans\u00a0<\/i>by about 20 percent\u2014and does it by mimicking the protective biological effects of calorie restriction. The drug activates the same genetic pathways as a super low-calorie diet. It also induces what\u2019s known as autophagy, or the clearing out of old cells, a critical process for health and one that deteriorates as we age. Worms lived longer even if they did not get the drug until they were old.<\/p>\n<p>Scientists have studied other compounds that imitate the genetic and molecular action of extreme dieting. Two of the most promising drugs for slowing aging, rapamycin and metformin, act on the same pathways and mechanisms that give calorie restriction its life-extending power. But some experimental compounds that seemed promising<a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/21167272\/\">\u00a0turn out to be toxic<\/a>\u00a0in animals.<\/p>\n<p>De Magalh\u00e3es uses computational methods to find a potential calorie-restriction-mimicking pill in the vast repositories of widely used medications, ones that are already proven safe in humans. He has found that rilmenidine triggers the same protective molecular effects in mice that he saw in worms, and he plans to study whether it also increases mice lifespan.<\/p>\n<p>He also hopes to investigate the anti-aging and longevity effects of the drug in people who take it for hypertension. Does rilmenidine lower their biological age? Does it reduce the risk of other age-related ailments?<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a long way, of course, from treating worms to treating people. When might we see a pill that safely and effectively tricks the human body into acting as if it\u2019s on the sparsest of diets, even as we eat to our heart\u2019s content?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the million-dollar question,\u201d de Magalh\u00e3es says. \u201cOn one hand, I\u2019m optimistic about it. On the other hand, I\u2019m also realistic that the benefits seen in animal models are not going to translate fully to human beings. The lifespan effects, 20 percent in worms, are going to be far more modest in humans. But if we can even only slightly increase lifespan\u2014and it\u2019s not just about lifespan\u2014if we can improve the health of elderly individuals by having this prevention measure, then that would be a fantastic achievement by itself.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/article>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This example of a five-day diet mimicking a fast would be taken no more than four times over the course of a year.
