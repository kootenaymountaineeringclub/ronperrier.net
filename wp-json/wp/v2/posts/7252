Getting to the summit is off trail traversing the boulders and scree in the Ymir Bowl. The reward is ridge hiking with stunning views. An ice axe is recommended most of the season and at time crampons are necessary for steep snow.<br \/>\nWeather &amp; Season. These routes are located in the alpine so temperatures will be much cooler than in Nelson with potential windchill and thunderstorms. Dress accordingly and be prepared for all weather.<br \/>\nThe season spans from late June to late September. Expect some snow along the approach and descent routes even in summer.\u00a0If you are looking at making a winter ascent, check the avalanche bulletin and use avalanche safety gear.<br \/>\nRead the \u201cBackcountry Access\u201d web page on the Whitewater Ski Resort website before heading out:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.skiwhitewater.com\/backcountry.php\">http:\/\/www.skiwhitewater.com\/backcountry.php<br \/>\n<\/a><\/span><\/em><em><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">According to the Norsemen, Ymir was a huge ice giant who was formed amid a jumble of ice blocks.

There are two main hiking routes up Ymir and both are off-trail with some light scrambling:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">1. <strong>West Ridge<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em>Route:<\/em> From the lodge, head directly toward the summit following &#8216;Lower Sluice Box&#8217;, a groomed ski run. The old rough road narrows to a path, winds through meadows, crosses a road and ascends through low bush to a boulder field where the trail disappears.\u00a0Left up the boulder field goes to the north ridge of Ymir via Half Dome.<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Cross to the south side of the stream under the west ridge, bushwhack a little and pass over the lowest part of what appears to be a spur in order to gain the steep snow slopes and the obvious col in the west ridge.\u00a0<\/span>1.5hrs. Scramble up the ridge to the summit, a nice walk with granite, boulders and larch. Circumnavigate a notch in the ridge to the south.\u00a0<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Bring crampons and an ice axe, and a light rope for those not used to steep snow. (II,3,s).<br \/>\n<\/span><em style=\"font-size: 13.3333px;\">FA by the Topographical Survey, date and route unknown.<\/em><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When descending the same way, below the col, do not pass over the \u201cspur\u201d, but go straight down through bush (easy, short) to open slopes below.<br \/>\n<\/span>Or traverse the mountain descending the north ridge to Half Dome.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Couloirs on the north side of the west ridge offer opportunities for steep snow climbs in the early part of the year.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">2. <strong>North Ridge.<br \/>\n<\/strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">This is often called the north ridge because the ridge curves. It divides at a lower peak called Half Dome, one branch going directly north (not visible from the bowl).<\/span><br \/>\nApproach. Follow the approach route above to the\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">switchback located at the end of the \u201cLittle Mucker Traverse.\u201d From here, continue along a faint climber\u2019s trail leading out of the ski area in a south-easterly direction towards Ymir Bowl. This short \u201ctrail\u201d initially crosses a healthy section of alder trees before emerging into an open talus slope at the bottom of \u201cGoat Slide\u201d in lower Ymir Bowl. Ascend the steepening talus slope straight up Goat Slide. The talus leads to steep grassy slopes and eventually the base of \u201cStarters\u201d on the Goat Wall. The approach to this point typically takes 1-1.5 hours.<br \/>\n<\/span> <span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Part of the ridge between Ymir and Half Dome is knife-edged. Take care with steep snow and cornices early in year.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The overhang at the notch in the north ridge can be turned. It is partly a route on steep snow.

All pitches, 30m or less in length, have bolted belays and can be rappelled with a single 60m rope. The climbing is interesting and varied however, the quality of the rock and routes does not warrant a classic mention. They provide a unique mountain experience with fun easy climbing and great views close to Nelson. Each individual section is interesting on its own, linking multiple sections together as part of a day trip increases the quality of the experience.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The rock is fractured and loose granite, average by Rockies standards. The routes have been cleaned of major loose blocks but caution is advised and are not manicured like at a crag. Expect lichen, shrubs and dirty ledges. They should only be attempted by experienced climbers.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Go to Whitewater Rocks to see detailed routes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">3. <strong>Southeast Ridge<\/strong>.
