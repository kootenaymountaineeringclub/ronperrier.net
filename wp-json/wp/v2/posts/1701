George Dawson of the Geological Survey of Canada is almost certainly the one who named the Valhallas. The name &#8220;Valhalla Mountains&#8221; is first mentioned in Dawson&#8217;s 1889 &#8220;Report on a portion of the West Kootenai District&#8221; and labelled on his accompanying &#8220;Reconnaissance Map of a portion of the West Kootenai District,&#8221; published in 1890.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Slocan-area historian Innes Cooper maintains that Dawson probably never saw or explored the Valhalla mountains from the Slocan valley, but perhaps named them after observing their distant peaks while travelling down the Arrow Lakes. Dawson states in his 1889 report that he gave the names Balder, Odin, Loki and Thor to individual mountains within the range, but does not state that he gave the name &#8220;Valhalla Mountains&#8221; to the encompassing terrain; his compatriot Amos Bowman had made a &#8216;..somewhat hurried traverse of the Columbia River and Arrow Lakes in the autumn of 1884&#8230; his sketch remained unpublished and even the principal geographical features of the region are laid down on the published maps in an extremely imperfect and sketchy manner&#8230;&#8217;<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The name Valhalla originated when the CPR lands superintendent, J. S. Dennis, recommended that the district be changed from Two Bit Creek to Valhalla as a result of a letter he received on May 30, 1911, from Philip Brooksbank, an English immigrant to Canada.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br \/>\nFew of the peaks of the West Kootenay are visible from major roads. The few exceptions are Devil&#8217;s Couch (called initially King Tut&#8217;s Throne) at the east end of the Devil&#8217;s Range, Dag (originally called Gimli I), and Gladsheim in Mulvey Basin. Many of the mountains were visible from the air, and Gimli was originally called Gimli II.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> A meeting was held in September 1968 to name peaks in Mulvey Basin. Bob Dean had been making a special study of Norse mythology and suggested the names of Asgard (Mulvey Cone), Midgard (Hemisphere), and Gimli (Gimli II). Helen Butling suggested the name Dag (Gimli I). That started things off, and they used virtually every Norse name possible in the mountains the club climbs &#8211; the Monashees, Selkirks, and the Purcells.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>NORSE MYTHOLOGY AND MOUNTAIN NAMES IN THE WEST KOOTENAY<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>VALHALLA RANGE<br \/>\nValhalla<\/strong> Range and Provincial Park\u2013 Selkirk Range. <em>Home of the gods in Asgard<\/em><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <strong>Nisleheim<\/strong> Pk \u2013 Valhallas between Gimli and Midgard. <em>Hall in Valhalla<\/em><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Asgard<\/strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Pk. \u2013 Mulvey Basin, Valhallas <\/span><em>Home of the gods.<br \/>\n<\/em><strong>Vingolf<\/strong>, Mt, N Valhallas SE of Shannon Lake at the north end of the range. <em>Home of the goddesses in Asgard<\/em><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <strong>Gladsheim<\/strong> Pk.

The northernmost extension of Germanic mythology, Norse mythology comprises tales of various deities, beings, and heroes derived from numerous sources, both before and after the pagan period, including medieval manuscripts, archaeological representations, and folk tradition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Most of the surviving mythology centers on the plights of the gods and their interaction with various other beings, such as humanity and the j\u00f6tnar, beings who may be friends, lovers, foes and\/or family members of the gods.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Worlds of Norse Mythology<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The cosmos, which all beings inhabit in Norse mythology, consists of Nine Worlds that flank a central cosmological tree, <em>Yggdrasil<\/em>. Units of time and elements of the cosmology are personified as deities or beings. Various forms of a creation myth are recounted, where the world is created from the flesh of the primordial being <strong>Ymir<\/strong>, and the first two humans are Ask and Embla. These worlds are foretold to be reborn after the events of <em>Ragnar\u00f6k<\/em>, when an immense battle occurs between the gods and their enemies, and the world is enveloped in flames, only to be reborn anew. There, the surviving gods will meet, and the land will be fertile and green, and two humans will repopulate the world.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The gods reside in the heavenly realm of Asgard, whereas humanity inhabits the realm of Midgard, a region situated at\u00a0the center of the cosmos. Pictured as placed somewhere in the middle of Yggdrasil, Midgard is surrounded by a world of water, or ocean, that is impassable. The ocean is inhabited by the great sea serpent <em>J\u00f6rmungandr<\/em>, who is so huge that he encircles the world entirely, grasping his tail. The realm was said to have been formed from the flesh and blood of Ymir, with his flesh constituting the land and his blood the oceans. It was connected to Asgard by the Bifr\u00f6st, a burning rainbow bridge that spans between Midgard (the world) and Asgard, the realm of the gods. Scholars have proposed that the bridge may have originally represented the Milky Way.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Midgard will be destroyed at <strong>Ragnar\u00f6k<\/strong>, the battle at the end of the world. J\u00f6rmungandr will emerge from the ocean, poisoning the land and sea with his venom, causing the sea to surge and lash against the land. The final battle will take place on the plain of <em>V\u00edgr\u00ed\u00f0r<\/em>, following which Midgard and almost all life on it will be destroyed, with the earth sinking into the sea, only to rise again, fertile and green.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <strong>Niflheim<\/strong> (&#8220;Mist Home&#8221;, the &#8220;Abode of Mist&#8221; or &#8220;Mist World) is one of the Nine Worlds and is a location in Norse mythology that overlaps with the notions of Niflhel and Hel. Niflheim was primarily a realm of primordial ice and cold, with nine frozen rivers. It was one of the two primordial realms, the other one being Muspelheim, the realm of fire. Between these two realms of cold and heat, creation began when its waters mixed with the heat of Muspelheim to form a &#8220;creating steam&#8221;. Later, it became the abode of Hel, a goddess, daughter of Loki, and the afterlife for her subjects, those who did not die a heroic or notable death.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Gods<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Numerous gods are mentioned in the source texts. As evidenced by records of personal and place names, the most popular god among the Scandinavians during the Viking Age was Thor, who is portrayed as relentlessly pursuing his foes, protecting humanity, and wielding his mountain-crushing, thunderous hammer, Mj\u00f6lnir,\u00a0in hand. In mythology, Thor lays waste to numerous <em>j\u00f6tnar<\/em> who are foes to the gods or humanity and is wed to the beautiful, golden-haired goddess <em>Sif<\/em>.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The god <strong>Odin<\/strong> is also frequently mentioned in surviving texts. One-eyed, wolf and raven-flanked, and spear in hand, Odin pursues knowledge throughout the world. In an act of self-sacrifice, Odin is described as having hung himself on the cosmological tree Yggdrasil to gain knowledge of the runic alphabet, which he passed on to humanity. He is associated closely with death, wisdom, and poetry. Odin has a strong association with death. Odin is called Allfather because he is the father of all the gods. He is also called Father of the Slain because all those who fall in battle are the sons of his adoption; for them he appoints Valhalla and Ving\u00f3lf, and they are then called Champions.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <em>Borr<\/em> (Old Norse: &#8216;son&#8217;, sometimes anglicized <strong>Bor<\/strong>) was the son of <em>B\u00fari<\/em>, the husband of <em>Bestla<\/em>, and the father of Odin and his brothers.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Odin&#8217;s wife is the powerful goddess <em>Frigg,<\/em> who can see the future but reveals it to no one; together, they have a beloved son, Baldr (also known as Balder or\u00a0<strong>Baldur<\/strong>). He has numerous brothers, such as Thor and V\u00e1li. Baldr&#8217;s wife is <em>Nanna,<\/em> and their son is <em>Forseti<\/em>. Baldr had the greatest ship ever built, named <em>Hringhorni<\/em>, and there was no place more beautiful than his hall, <em>Breidablik<\/em>. The death of Baldr was both a great tragedy and a harbinger of Ragnar\u00f6k. After a series of dreams by Baldr of his impending death, Loki engineers his death, and Baldr thereafter resides in Hel, a realm ruled over by a goddess of the same name. <strong>Loki<\/strong> is a god or j\u00f6tunn (or both). Loki is the son of <em>F\u00e1rbauti<\/em> and <em>Laufey<\/em>, and the brother of <em>Helblindi<\/em> and <em>B\u00fdleistr<\/em>. By the j\u00f6tunn <em>Angrbo\u00f0a<\/em>, Loki is the father of <em>Hel<\/em>, the wolf <em>Fenrir<\/em>, and the world serpent <em>J\u00f6rmungandr<\/em>. By his wife <em>Sigyn<\/em>, Loki is the father of <em>Narfi<\/em> and\/or <em>Nari<\/em>. And by the stallion <em>Sva\u00f0ilfari<\/em>, Loki is the mother\u2014giving birth in the form of a mare\u2014to the eight-legged horse <em>Sleipnir<\/em>. Loki&#8217;s relationship with the gods varies depending on the source. Loki sometimes assists the gods and at other times causes problems for them. Loki is a shape-shifter, and in separate incidents, he appears in the forms of a salmon, mare, seal, fly, and possibly an older woman. Loki&#8217;s positive relations with the gods end with his role in engineering the death of the god Baldr. Loki is eventually bound by the gods with the entrails of one of his sons. Loki&#8217;s origins and role in Norse mythology, which some scholars have described as that of a trickster god, have been much debated by scholars.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <em>H\u00f6\u00f0r<\/em> (often anglicized as Hod, <strong>Hoder<\/strong>, or Hodr) is the god of winter and brother of Baldr in Norse mythology. Tricked and guided by Loki, he shot the mistletoe arrow that was to slay the otherwise invulnerable Baldr. The goddess Frigg made everything in existence swear never to harm Baldr, except for the mistletoe, which she found too young to demand an oath from. The gods amused themselves by trying weapons on Baldr and seeing them fail to do any harm. Loki, upon finding out about Baldr&#8217;s one weakness, made a missile from mistletoe and helped H\u00f6\u00f0r shoot it at Baldr. After this, Odin and the giantess <em>Rindr<\/em> gave birth to <em>V\u00e1li<\/em>, who grew to adulthood within a day and slew H\u00f6\u00f0r.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <em>Rindr<\/em> (Old Norse) or <strong>Rinda<\/strong> (Latin) is a female character in Norse mythology, alternatively described as a giantess, a goddess or a human princess from the east (somewhere in present-day Russia). Odin impregnated her and gave birth to the avenger of Baldr&#8217;s death, in the Old Norse sources, V\u00e1li. There, she is called Rinda and is the daughter of the King of the Ruthenians. After Balderus&#8217; death, Odin consulted seers on how to get revenge. On their advice, Odin went to the Ruthenians disguised as a warrior called Roster. There he was twice turned down by Rinda. He then wrote runes on a piece of bark and touched her with it, causing her to go mad, and disguised himself as a medicine woman called Wecha, who was allowed to see her. Finally, she fell ill, and the disguised Odin then said he had medicine with which to cure her, but that it would cause a violent reaction. On Odin&#8217;s advice, the king tied Rinda to her bed, and Odin proceeded to rape her. From the rape was born <em>Bous<\/em>, who would later avenge Balderus.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <strong>Woden<\/strong> (Old High German: W\u00f4dan, Old Saxon: Uu\u00f4den) is a principal deity of Anglo-Saxon and Continental Germanic polytheism.

She prefers the wolf howls of the winter mountains to the seashore. In all sources, Ska\u00f0i is the daughter of the deceased <em>\u00dejazi<\/em>, and Ska\u00f0i married the god Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r as part of the compensation provided by the gods for killing her father \u00dejazi. In Heimskringla, Ska\u00f0i is described as having split up with Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r and as later having married the god Odin, and the two produced many children together. Ska\u00f0i is responsible for placing the serpent that drips venom onto the bound Loki. Ska\u00f0i is alternately referred to as \u00d6ndurgu\u00f0 (Old Norse &#8220;ski god&#8221;) and \u00d6ndurd\u00eds (Old Norse &#8220;ski lady&#8221;).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Freyja&#8217;s brother, the god <em>Freyr<\/em>, is also frequently mentioned in surviving texts.

Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r is strongly associated with the sea, seafaring, wind, fishing, wealth, crop fertility, and prosperity. Veneration of Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r survived into 18th or 19th-century Norwegian folk practice, where the god is recorded as Njor and thanked for a bountiful catch of fish. Freyja and Freyr&#8217;s mother is Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r&#8217;s sister. However, there is more information about his pairing with the skiing and hunting goddess Ska\u00f0i.

In Asgard, the realm of the gods, Gimli is the golden roof of a building where righteous men go when they die.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Odin\u2019s most outstanding achievement, however, is the making of man and giving him a soul that will live and never die, although his body may decay to dust or burn to ashes. All righteous men shall live and be with him where it is called <em>Giml\u00e9<\/em> [lee-of-fire] or <em>Ving\u00f3lf<\/em> [friendly door], but wicked men will go to <em>Hel<\/em> and thence to <em>Niflhel<\/em> [abode of darkness], that is down in the ninth world. At first, he appointed rulers who, along with him, were to control the destinies of men and decide how the stronghold should be governed. That was in the place called <em>I\u00f0av\u00f6ll<\/em> in the middle of the stronghold. Their first task was to build a temple in which there were seats for the twelve of them, apart from the high seat of the All-father. That is the largest and best dwelling on earth; outside and in, it is like pure gold. It is called Gla\u00f0sheimr (Gladshiem &#8211; Old Norse &#8220;bright or radiant home&#8221;), where Odin&#8217;s hall, Valhalla,\u00a0is located. It is a meeting hall containing thirteen high seats where the male Asgardians hold council.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> They built another hall nearby that was the sanctuary of the goddesses, and it was a magnificent building; it is called <strong>Ving\u00f3lf<\/strong>. The three mentions of Ving\u00f3lf seem somewhat contradictory. Initially, it appears as an alternative name for Giml\u00e9, a paradise where righteous people are believed to go after death. In the second instance, it is the hall or h\u00f6rgr of the goddesses. In the third instance, it serves as a residence for those who were slain in battle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Afterlife.<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The afterlife is a complex matter in Norse mythology. The dead may go to the murky realm of <em>Hel<\/em> (<strong>Hela<\/strong>). In Norse mythology, Hel is a female being who presides over a realm of the same name, where she receives a portion of the dead. Hel is referred to as a daughter of Loki, and to &#8220;go to Hel&#8221; is to die. Hel is described as having been appointed by the god Odin as ruler of a realm of the same name, located in <em>Niflheim<\/em> (<strong>Niselheim<\/strong> \u2013 fog home or abode of darkness). Her appearance is described as half black and half flesh-coloured, and further as having a gloomy, downcast appearance. Hel rules over vast mansions with many servants in her underworld realm and plays a key role in the attempted resurrection of the god Baldr.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Valkyries may also ferry the dead away to Odin&#8217;s martial hall, Valhalla, or may be chosen by the goddess Freyja to dwell in her field, F\u00f3lkvangr. The goddess <em>R\u00e1n<\/em> may claim those who die at sea, and the goddess <em>Gefjon<\/em> is said to be attended by virgins upon their death. References to reincarnation are also made. Time itself is presented as a combination of cyclic and linear, and some scholars have argued that cyclic time was the original format for mythology.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Other beings.<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Various beings outside of the gods are mentioned.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Outside of the gods, humanity, and the j\u00f6tnar, these Nine Worlds are inhabited by a variety of beings, such as <em>elves<\/em> and <em>dwarfs<\/em>. Travel between the worlds is frequently recounted in the myths, where the gods and other beings may interact directly with humanity. Numerous creatures live on Yggdrasil, such as the insulting messenger squirrel <em>Ratatoskr<\/em> and the perching hawk <em>Ve\u00f0rf\u00f6lnir<\/em>. The tree itself has three primary roots, and at the base of one of these roots, a trio of norns resides.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Elves and dwarves are commonly mentioned and appear to be connected, but their attributes are vague, and the relation between the two is ambiguous. Elves are described as radiant and beautiful, whereas dwarves often act as earthy smiths. A group of beings variously described as <em>j\u00f6tnar<\/em>, <em>thursar<\/em>, and <em>trolls<\/em> (in English, these are all often glossed as &#8220;giants&#8221;) frequently appear. These beings may either aid, deter, or take their place among the gods.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The <em>norns<\/em>, <em>d\u00edsir<\/em>, and <em>valkyries<\/em> also receive frequent mention. While their functions and roles may overlap and differ, all are collective female beings associated with fate.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The <strong>Norns<\/strong> are female beings who rule the destiny of gods and men, possibly a kind of d\u00edsire. The three most essential norns, <em>Ur\u00f0r<\/em>, <em>Ver\u00f0andi,<\/em> and <em>Skuld, come out from a hall standing at the Well of Ur\u00f0r (well of fate),<\/em>\u00a0and they draw water from the well and take sand that lies around it, which they pour over Yggdrasill so that its branches will not rot. These norns are described as three powerful maiden giantesses (Jotuns) whose arrival from <em>J\u00f6tunheimr<\/em> marked the end of the golden age of the gods. Besides these three norns, many other norns arrive when a person is born to determine their future. There were both malevolent and benevolent Norns, and the former caused all the evil and tragic events in the world while the latter were kind and protective goddesses. Recent research has discussed the relationship between the myths associated with norns and valkyries and travelling <em>V\u00f6lvas<\/em> (sei\u00f0r-workers). The norns were thought to have visited newborn children in the pre-Christian Norse societies.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Norns within Skaldic references are often seen as negative beings that are primarily associated with transitional situations such as violent death and battle. Another negative aspect associated with the Norns is that they are often linked to death. Not all aspects of the Norns were negative, however, as they were also associated with life and birth. <em>Ur\u00f0r<\/em> (Old Norse &#8220;fate&#8221;, English: <strong>Urd<\/strong>) is one of the Norns in Norse mythology. Along with <em>Ver\u00f0andi<\/em> (possibly &#8220;happening&#8221; or &#8220;present&#8221;) and <em>Skuld<\/em> (perhaps &#8220;debt&#8221; or &#8220;future&#8221;), Ur\u00f0r makes up a trio of Norns that are described as deciding the fates of people. Ur\u00f0r is together with the Norns located at the well Ur\u00f0arbrunnr beneath the world ash tree Yggdrasil of Asgard. They spin threads of life, cut marks in the pole figures and measure people&#8217;s destinies, which shows the fate of all human beings and gods. Norns are always present when a child is born and decide their fate. The three Norns represent the past (Ur\u00f0r), future (Skuld) and present (Ver\u00f0andi).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> In Norse mythology, a <em>valkyrie<\/em> (from Old Norse valkyrja, &#8220;chooser of the slain&#8221;) is one of a host of female figures who decide which soldiers die in battle and which live to fight another day. Selecting among half of those who die in battle (the other half go to the goddess Freyja&#8217;s afterlife field, F\u00f3lkvangr), the valkyries bring their chosen to the afterlife hall of the slain, Valhalla, ruled over by the god Odin. There, the deceased warriors become <em>Einherjar<\/em>. When the einherjar are not preparing for the events of Ragnar\u00f6k, the valkyries bear them mead. Valkyries also appear as lovers of heroes and other mortals, where they are sometimes described as the daughters of royalty, sometimes accompanied by ravens, and sometimes connected to swans or horses. In modern culture, valkyries have been the subject of various artistic works, including musical compositions, video games, and poetry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Personified elements.<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Elements of the cosmos are personified, such as the Sun (<em>S\u00f3l<\/em>, a goddess), the Moon (<em>M\u00e1ni<\/em>, a god), and Earth (<em>J\u00f6r\u00f0<\/em>, a goddess), as well as units of time, such as day (<em>Dagr<\/em>, <strong>Dag<\/strong>, a god) and night (<strong>N\u00f3tt<\/strong>, a j\u00f6tunn). In Norse mythology, Dagr (Old Norse for &#8220;day&#8221;) is the personification of the day. Dagr is stated to be the son of the god <em>Dellingr<\/em> and is associated with the bright-maned horse <em>Skinfaxi<\/em>, who &#8220;draws day to mankind&#8221;. Depending on the manuscript variation, Dagr is either Dellingr&#8217;s son by N\u00f3tt, the personification of night, or J\u00f6r\u00f0, the personification of\u00a0Earth. Otherwise, Dagr appears as a common noun simply meaning &#8220;day&#8221; throughout Old Norse works.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Valhalla \u2013 modern references.<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Valhalla is referenced in the video game titles Valhalla (1983), Valhalla: Before the War (1995), Valkyrie Profile (2000), Max Payne (2001), Valhalla Knights (2006), Final Fantasy XI (2002), Metroid Prime 3: Corruption (2007), Halo 3 (2007), The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (2011), Final Fantasy XIII-2 (2011), and Halo 4 (2012). Amusement park attractions named after Valhalla include Valhalla Borgen in Tivoli Gardens, Copenhagen, Denmark, and Valhalla in Pleasure Beach Blackpool, Blackpool, England. Valhalla is also the name of Crom&#8217;s hall in the 1982 movie, Conan the Barbarian. There is a continuous spell card in Yu-Gi-Oh named Valhalla Hall of the Fallen.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Locations named after Valhalla exist in North America (including Valhalla, New York, Valhalla Centre, Alberta, Walhalla, Michigan, Walhalla, North Dakota, Walhalla, South Carolina, and Walhalla, Texas), Australia (Walhalla, Victoria), and South Africa (Valhalla, Pretoria), Valhalla Range of mountains and Valhalla Provincial Park in British Columbia, as well as Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>THE DEVILS RANGE \u2013 Valhalla Provincial Park<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Devils Range is a line of twelve named peaks in the Valhalla Ranges (part of the Selkirk Mountains, which are part of the Columbia Mountains) in the West Kootenay of southern British Columbia. The 12 peaks run in an east\/west direction between Gwillim Creek to the south and Evans Lake to the north. It is about nine kilometres from one end to the other. Many of the peaks have a dramatic spire shape, are made of gneiss, and make for excellent rock climbing.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The only reasonable access is the Hoder Creek Road (high clearance, overgrown for the last 2 km), which gives access to the Drinnon Pass trail and Gwillim Lakes. Black Prince and Lucifer are climbed from the Gwillim Lakes Basin (Trident and Mephistopheles can also be climbed from here or from Gwillim Creek). The rest are climbed from Gwillim Creek. There is no trail access to this part of the range.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br \/>\nMembers of the Kootenay Mountaineering Club named them. <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The names all convey some image of the devil. The following list starts with Black Prince on the west end and ends with Devil&#8217;s Couch on the east.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>THE DEVIL<br \/>\n<\/strong>The Devil (from Greek diablos = slanderer or accuser) is believed in many religions, myths, and cultures to be a supernatural entity that is the personification of evil and the enemy of God and humankind. The nature of the role varies greatly, ranging from being an effective counterforce to the creator god, locked in an eons-long struggle for human souls on even terms, to being a comical figure of fun or an abstract aspect of the individual human condition.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> While mainstream Judaism contains no overt concept of a devil, Christianity and Islam have variously regarded the Devil as a rebellious fallen angel or demon that tempts humans to sin, if not commit evil deeds himself. In these religions, particularly during periods of division or external threat, the Devil has assumed more of a dualistic status commonly associated with heretics, infidels, and other unbelievers. As such, the Devil is seen as an allegory that represents a crisis of faith, individualism, free will, wisdom, and enlightenment.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> In mainstream Christianity, God and the Devil are usually portrayed as fighting over the souls of humans, with the Devil seeking to lure people away from God and into Hell. The Devil commands a force of evil spirits, commonly known as demons. The Hebrew Bible (or Old Testament) describes the Adversary (ha-satan) as an angel who instigates tests upon humankind. Many other religions have a trickster or tempter figure that is similar to the Devil. Modern conceptions of the Devil include the concept that it symbolizes humans&#8217; own lower nature or sinfulness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>1. BLACK PRINCE.<\/strong> (2790m)<br \/>\nThe westernmost peak of the range is at the apex of the watersheds of Woden Creek, Gwillim Creek, and Evans Lake. The first recorded ascent was by Ron Anderson, Stan Baker, Vince Joseph, and Peter Wood in 1975. Nontechnical by many approaches, but usually climbed via the south slopes from Gwillim Basin.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Edward of Woodstock, Prince of Wales, Duke of Cornwall, Prince of Aquitaine, KG (15 June 1330 \u2013 8 June 1376) was the eldest son of King Edward III of England and his wife Philippa of Hainault, as well as father to King Richard II of England. He was known as Edward of Woodstock in his early life, after his birthplace, and has been popularly referred to as the Black Prince since the 16th century. He was an exceptional military leader, and his victories over the French at the Battles of Cr\u00e9cy and Poitiers made him very popular during his lifetime. In 1348, he became the first Knight of the Garter, of whose Order he was one of the founders.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Edward&#8217;s brutality in France is also well-documented, and it is believed that this is where the title originated. The French soldier Philippe de M\u00e9zi\u00e8res refers to Edward as the greatest of the &#8220;black boars&#8221; \u2013 those aggressors who had done so much to disrupt relations within Christendom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>2. LUCIFER.<\/strong> (2760m)<br \/>\nFirst ascent Bob Dean, Howie Ridge August 24, 1970. Usually climbed via the east ridge (class 3) from Gwillim Basin.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Lucifer means &#8220;shining one, morning star, the planet Venus&#8221;, or, as an adjective, &#8220;light-bringing&#8221;. The pseudepigrapha of pre-Christian Enochic Judaism, which enjoyed considerable popularity during the Second Temple period, attributed an expanded role to Satan, interpreting Isaiah 14:12-15, with its reference to the morning star, as applicable to him, and presenting him as a fallen angel cast out of heaven. Christian tradition, influenced by this presentation, came to use the Latin word for &#8220;morning star, &#8221; Lucifer, as a proper name (&#8220;Lucifer&#8221;) for Satan as Satan was before his fall. As a result, &#8220;Lucifer has become a byword for Satan in the Church and popular literature&#8221;, as in Dante Alighieri&#8217;s Inferno and John Milton&#8217;s Paradise Lost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>3. TRIDENT<\/strong> (2730m)<br \/>\nFirst ascent as a traverse of Trident, Rosemary\u2019s Baby, and Mephistopheles by Howie Ridge, Gordon Stein, and Peter Wood in early September 1973. The tricky bit was the SW ridge of Trident class 5.3, and the rest of the traverse is easy. Most commonly climbed as a traverse from the Mephistopheles\/Rosemary\u2019s Baby col. Approach from Gwillim Basin or Gwillim Creek.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> A trident is a three-pronged spear. It is used for spear fishing and was also a military weapon. Tridents are featured widely in mythical, historical, and modern culture. Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea, Greco-Roman Poseidon, Neptune, the Roman god of the sea, and the major Hindu Lord and God, Shiva, are all classically depicted bearing a trident. Tridents can be distinguished from pitchforks in that the latter is an agricultural tool with two to six tines (also called prongs) which are shaped in such a way that they can be used to lift and pitch (throw) loose material. The Grim Reaper carried a scythe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>4. ROSEMARY\u2019S BABY<\/strong> (2700m)<br \/>\nThe mountain, on profile, looks like a pregnant woman lying on her back.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Rosemary&#8217;s Baby is a 1967 best-selling horror novel by Ira Levin, his second published book. It sold over 4 million copies, making it the top-selling horror novel of the 1960s.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The book centers on Rosemary Woodhouse, a young woman who has just moved into the Bramford, an old Gothic Revival-style apartment building in New York City, with her husband, Guy, a struggling actor. The pair is warned that the Bramford has a disturbing history involving witchcraft and murder, but they choose to overlook this. Rosemary has long wanted children, but Guy prefers to wait until he is more established in his career. Rosemary and Guy are quickly welcomed to Bramford by neighbours Minnie and Roman Castevet, an eccentric elderly couple. Rosemary finds them meddlesome and absurd, but Guy begins paying them frequent visits.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> After a theatrical rival suddenly goes blind, Guy is given an essential part in a stage play. Immediately afterward, Guy unexpectedly agrees with Rosemary that it is time to conceive their first child. Guy&#8217;s performance in the stage play brings him favourable notice, and he is subsequently cast in other, increasingly important roles; he begins to talk about a career in Hollywood.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> After receiving a warning from a friend, who also becomes mysteriously ill, Rosemary discovers that her neighbours are the leaders of a Satanic coven, and she suspects they intend to steal her child and use it as a sacrifice to the Devil. Despite her growing conviction, she is unable to convince anyone else and soon becomes sure that there is no one actually on her side, least of all her husband. Ultimately, Rosemary finds that she is wrong about the coven&#8217;s reason for wanting the baby &#8211; the baby is the Antichrist, and Guy is not the father.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>5. MEPHISTOPHELES<\/strong> (2730m)<br \/>\nEasily climbed from the col to the west.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Mephistopheles is a demon featured in German folklore. He originally appeared in literature as the demon in the Faust legend, and he has since appeared in other works as a stock character version of the Devil. The name is associated with the Faust legend of a scholar, based on the historical Johann Georg Faust, who wagers his soul with the Devil.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Although Mephistopheles appears to Faustus as a devil \u2014 a worker for Satan \u2014 critics claim that he does not search for men to corrupt but comes to serve and ultimately collect the souls of those who are already damned. Mephistopheles is already trapped in his hell by serving the Devil. He warns Faustus of the choice he is making by &#8220;selling his soul&#8221; to the Devil: &#8220;Mephistophilis, an agent of Lucifer, appears and at first advises Faust not to forgo the promise of heaven to pursue his goals\u201d. Faustus enters an ever-present private hell like that of Mephistopheles.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>6. DEVILS DOME<\/strong> (2790M)<br \/>\nThe highest mountain in the Devils Range, it is the most impressive of the peaks as seen from the Drinnon Lake approach. First ascent Bob Dean, Howie Ridge, July 18, 1971. It has no easy route. It is most commonly climbed via the south face, Class 5.5.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>7. CHARIOT PEAK<\/strong> (2700M)<br \/>\nLocated 1.6 km ENE of Devil&#8217;s Dome and first recorded ascent by Howie Ridge, Gordon Stein, Peter Wood, September 1973. A long side-hilling traverse leads to the wide basin at the bottom of the peak\u2014an easy traverse leads over all three peaks, each with a cairn. The NE end is the highest and has a 2-meter cairn. Could you describe the east ridge of the SW peak?<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> I could find no connection between chariots and the devil. Who named this mountain? Maybe they know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>8. DIABLO<\/strong>, MOUNT (2670m)<br \/>\nDiablo, Banshee, and Satan were first climbed by a large KMC party in August 1974. They are all easy scrambles up prominent ridges. Diablo is Spanish for the devil. Greek for the devil is diablos.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>9. BANSHEE PEAK<\/strong> (2730m)<br \/>\nThe banshee (Irish: \u201cwoman of the fairy mounds&#8221;) is a female spirit in Irish mythology, usually seen as an omen of death and a messenger from the Otherworld.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> In legend, a banshee is a fairy woman who wails if someone is about to die. In Scottish Gaelic mythology, she is seen washing the bloodstained clothes or armour of those who are about to die. Similar beings are also found in Welsh, Norse, and American folklore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>10. SATAN PEAK<\/strong> (2640m)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Satan (Hebrew: &#8220;the opposer&#8221;) is a character appearing in the texts of the Abrahamic religions, who personifies evil and temptation and is known as the deceiver who leads humanity astray. The term is often applied to an angel who fell out of favour with God, seducing humanity into the ways of sin, and who now rules over the fallen world.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Satan is primarily understood as an &#8220;accuser&#8221; or &#8220;adversary&#8221; in the Hebrew Bible and is not necessarily the personification of evil that he would become in later Abrahamic religions. In the New Testament, Satan is a name that refers to a decidedly malevolent entity (devil) who possesses demonic god-like qualities. In Theistic Satanism, Satan is considered a positive force and deity who is either worshipped or revered. In LaVeyan Satanism, Satan is regarded as holding virtuous characteristics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>VADER PASS<\/strong> Darth Vader (born Anakin Skywalker) is the central character of the Star Wars saga, appearing as one of the main antagonists of the original trilogy and as one of the main protagonists of the prequel trilogy.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">George Lucas, along with numerous actors, has created and portrayed the character. His appearances span all six Star Wars films, and he is a key character in the expanded universe, encompassing television series, video games, novels, literature, and comic books. The films establish that he was initially a Jedi who was part of the prophecy of being the Chosen One, tasked with restoring balance to the Force, but fell to the dark side of the Force. He is also the father of both Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia, the two main protagonists of the original trilogy.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> In Attack of the Clones, Anakin Skywalker feels &#8220;smothered&#8221; by Obi-Wan Kenobi and is unable to control his life. By Revenge of the Sith, however, Anakin&#8217;s &#8220;father-son&#8221; friction with his master has matured into a more equal, brotherly relationship. Once he becomes Darth Vader, each evil act he commits makes it harder for him to return to the light, but Vader ultimately escapes the dark side and redeems himself before he dies by saving his son and killing Palpatine.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Eric Bui, a psychiatrist at the University of Toulouse Hospital, argued at the 2007 American Psychiatric Association convention that Anakin meets six of the nine diagnostic criteria for borderline personality disorder (BPD), one more than necessary for a diagnosis. Bui says he found Anakin Skywalker a valuable example to explain BPD to medical students. In particular, Bui points to Anakin&#8217;s abandonment issues and uncertainty over his identity. Anakin&#8217;s mass murders of the Tusken Raiders in Attack of the Clones and the young Jedi in Revenge of the Sith count as two dissociative episodes, fulfilling another criterion. Bui hoped his paper would help raise awareness of the disorder, especially among teens.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Darth Vader&#8217;s iconic status has made the character a synonym for evil in popular culture; psychiatrists have even considered him a valuable example to explain borderline personality disorder to medical students.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>11. DEVILS SPIRE<\/strong> (2640m)<br \/>\nAn impressive peak between Satan Peak and Devil&#8217;s Couch. The first recorded ascent was by Ian Hamilton and Howie Ridge in August 1974. Class 5.3 climb up the middle of the NE face. Exposed on the summit ridge, class 4 and low 5. Two rappels on the descent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>12. DEVILS COUCH<\/strong> (2730m)<br \/>\nOriginally called King Tut\u2019s Couch. It is the easternmost peak of the Devils Range, NNW of Gladsheim. It is visible from Cape Horn on Highway 6. First climbed in 1967 by Bob Dean, Frank Nixon, and his dog. The approach was up the old Gwillim Creek Road, a trail, followed by a bushwhack, and numerous ups and downs on the ridge over the course of two days. Now it is reached from Coven Lakes. The west summit is the highest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>CAULDRON LAKE<\/strong> This pretty lake is 2 kilometres south and 1,900 feet lower than the summit of Devil&#8217;s Dome. It is the standard campsite for many trips in the Devils Range: to climb Mephistopheles, Devils Dome, False Devils Dome, Chariot, and the cross-country trip to Coven Lakes, at the east end of the range.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Cauldrons have largely fallen out of use as cooking vessels in the developed world. While still used for practical purposes, a more common association in Western culture is the cauldron&#8217;s use in witchcraft\u2014a clich\u00e9 popularized by various works of fiction, such as Shakespeare&#8217;s play Macbeth. In fiction, witches often prepare their potions in a cauldron. Additionally, in Irish folklore, a cauldron is said to be where leprechauns store their gold and treasure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>COVEN LAKES <\/strong>These five small lakes are set in a volcanic caldera at the east end of the Devils Range. They give access to climb Devil Couch, Devil&#8217;s Spire, Satan, Banshee, and Diablo. The best campsite is on a spit between the two large lakes. It is most likely to have a breeze to help deal with all the mosquitoes. Looking south are Mt Gladsheim and Asgard in Mulvey Basin. It is a magical place with very few visitors (on average, one group per year).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> In Wicca and other similar forms of modern neopagan witchcraft, such as Stregheria and Feri Witchcraft, a coven is a gathering or community of witches, much like a congregation in Christian parlance. It is composed of a group of believers who gather together for ceremonies of worship, such as Drawing Down the Moon or celebrating the Sabbats. The number of persons involved may vary. Although thirteen is considered ideal, any group of at least three can be a coven. A group of two is usually referred to as a &#8220;working couple&#8221; (regardless of their sex). Within the community, many believe that a coven larger than thirteen is unwieldy, citing unwieldy group dynamics and an unfair burden on the leadership. When a coven has grown too large to be manageable, it may split, or &#8220;hive&#8221;. In Wicca, this may also occur when a newly made High Priest or High Priestess, also called 3rd Degree ordination, leaves to start their coven. Wiccan covens are generally jointly led by a High Priestess and a High Priest, though some are led by only one or the other. In more recent forms of neopagan witchcraft, covens are sometimes run as democracies with a rotating leadership.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>WICCA LAKE.<\/strong> This is the lovely lake on Drinnon Pass, above Drinnon Lake. A campsite on its shore has six tent pads, a food cache, a toilet, and a cooking centre.<br \/>\nWicca is a modern pagan witchcraft religion. It was developed in England during the first half of the 20th century and was introduced to the public in 1954 by Gerald Gardner, a retired British civil servant. It draws upon a diverse set of ancient pagan and 20th-century hermetic motifs for its theological structure and ritual practice.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Wicca is a diverse religion with no central authority or figure defining it. It is divided into various lineages and denominations, referred to as traditions, each with its organizational structure and level of centralization. Due to its decentralized nature, there is some disagreement over what constitutes Wicca. Some traditions, collectively referred to as British Traditional Wicca, strictly follow the initiatory lineage of Gardner and consider the term &#8220;Wicca&#8221; to apply only to such lineaged traditions, whereas other eclectic traditions do not.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Wicca is typically duotheistic, worshipping a god and a goddess, traditionally viewed as a mother goddess and a horned god. These two deities are often regarded as aspects of a broader pantheistic godhead. However, beliefs range from hard polytheism to even monotheism. Wiccan celebrations follow approximately eight seasonally based festivals known as Sabbats. The Wiccan Rede, an unattributed statement, serves as the traditional basis of Wiccan morality. Wicca often involves the ritual practice of magic, though it is not always necessary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>WARLOCK LAKE.<\/strong> A small lake below Drinnon Pass and Wicca Lake on the trail to Gwillim. It is a common departure point for the bushwhack to Cauldron Lakes and the east end of the Devils Range.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Warlock &#8211; a magician who uses or practices magic that derives from supernatural or occult sources. Magicians are familiar figures in works of fantasy, such as fantasy literature and role-playing games. They draw on the history of such people in mythology, legends, fiction, and folklore.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Kootenay Mountaineering Club has played a significant role in naming mountains in the West Kootenay region.
