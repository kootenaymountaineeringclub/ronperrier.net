As the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, Haiti\u2019s poverty is glaring. 75% make<br \/>\ntheir living in the service economy. Everyone is out there eking out a living in some basic way: selling something &#8211; the street market in Cape Haitian is gigantic \u2013 occupying at least 3 X 10 blocks of streets, all impenetrable to vehicles as the lanes between stalls can only be walked. And the other market occupying a garbage tip on the beach is also large with different goods (used clothing, charcoal and produce). The average income is less than US$2\/day. The paper money is filthy.<br \/>\n75% of people don\u2019t have running water in their homes. Electricity is erratic, blackouts daily and generators are a must. Mosquitos are common at night due to all the standing water.<br \/>\n<strong>2. People.<\/strong> Virtually everyone is black with few brown people. Shortly after independence in 1804, the president killed all the whites (over 3,000 people). You don\u2019t see anyone who is fat. Most people look healthy but thin. No one smokes.<br \/>\nBegging: non-existent in Cap Haitian, very common in Port-au-Prince.<br \/>\n<strong>3. Garbage<\/strong> is devastating in Cap Haitian. I have never seen anything like it. One downtown half street was piled high. Old plastic bottles are black and flattened. The beach and water was covered in plastic. A market exists on a garbage tip on the beach. There is no attempt to clean it up.<br \/>\nIn PaP, it is much cleaner and comparable to India. I even saw a large garbage truck with 6 men removing a large pile near the main square. Some of it is smoking as they try to burn it.<br \/>\n<strong>4. Safety.<\/strong> Cap Haitian is very safe, PaP is completely unsafe south of a few blocks from the main town square. One can\u2019t drive anywhere there or along the coast to Jacmel (via Carreforre) without a 100% risk of carjacking or kidnapping. There are 160 gangs that control vast areas of south Haiti dealing in drugs, prostitution and kidnapping.<br \/>\n<strong>5. Costs.<\/strong> It is cheap on the streets and using moto-taxis and tuk-tuks, but hotels and taxis are relatively expensive. Hotels have to provide their own electricity, water and armed guards to be able to provide security.<\/p>\n<p><sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><em>I took the Caribe Tours bus from Santo Domingo on March 28 (8 am, 1,750 DR + US$37 departure tax, 7 hours with all the immigration) to Cap Haitian, Haiti, in the north. We crossed the border at\u00a0Ounaminthe-Dajabon. I stayed at Habitacion Des Lauiers (US$50\/night),\u00a0 a lovely hotel, a short steep walk above downtown. I think it is the best hotel in Cap Haitian as it is well run and has electricity all the time because of its two generators. Screens keep the mosquitos out.\u00a0<\/em><\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><em>The rooms were simple but very adequate. I stayed two nights and had great sleeps and didn&#8217;t need a fan. The mosquitos though are particularly well but I opened my door quickly to not let any in.<br \/>\n<\/em><em>On the bus, I sat next to a lovely Mexican guy, Jaime who has also traveled extensively. He was a life-saver as he was organized. We had both arranged the same hotel and took a taxi arranged by the hotel, $10 each (very expensive) up to the hotel, even though it was only a 1.9 km walk uphill.\u00a0<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">After a good breakfast, we walked down through town. Cap Haitian (compared to Port au Prince &#8211; PaP) is very safe with no kidnapping or crime.<\/span><\/em><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Our Lady of the Assumption Cathedral.<\/strong> This is a nice 3-nave church with wonderful wood ceilings in the nave, cross, and altar. We were shown around by two guys who were exuberant about their church. All the Ways of the Cross had been stolen. We gave them $5 for the great tour. They said there is a tunnel all the way from The Palace to under the altar was used by Henri Cristophe to get to the church.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><em>We then continued our walk through downtown to the Old Market (Pont Neuf Market), situated on the beach on top of a garbage dump. It is huge with sections devoted to clothes (all used Western clothes), charcoal, and food. The people hate having their photos taken so I only took a few of the wares.\u00a0<\/em><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><em>The garbage in OCap is devastating. An entire half street is full of it. It is everywhere especially on the beach. I have never seen anything remotely close in my previous 149 countries. Open sewers and a lot of standing water contribute to the mosquito problem.<br \/>\n<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Citadel, Sans Souci, Ramiers World Heritage Site.<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Palace of Sans-Souci<\/b>\u00a0was the principal royal residence of\u00a0Henry I,\u00a0King\u00a0of\u00a0Haiti, better known as\u00a0Henri Christophe. It is located in the town of\u00a0Milot, approximately five km northeast of the\u00a0Citadelle Laferri\u00e8re, and thirteen km southwest of the\u00a0Three Bays Protected Area.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The palace&#8217;s name,\u00a0French\u00a0for &#8220;carefree&#8221;, is shared with both\u00a0Sanssouci,\u00a0Frederick the Great&#8217;s palace in\u00a0Potsdam, Germany, and with\u00a0Haitian Revolution\u00a0military leader\u00a0Jean-Baptiste Sans Souci, who was executed by\u00a0Henri Christophe\u00a0in 1803.\u00a0The palace was built between 1810-1813 by an undetermined number of workers.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The residence accommodated the king, his family, Queen\u00a0Marie-Louise, and their children, along with their royal staff of advisors. It was the most important of nine palaces commissioned by the king, as well as fifteen ch\u00e2teaux, numerous forts, and sprawling summer homes on his twenty plantations.\u00a0The nearest airport and large city is\u00a0Cap-Ha\u00eftien.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Before the construction of Sans-Souci,\u00a0Milot\u00a0was a French plantation that Christophe managed for a period during the\u00a0Haitian Revolution.\u00a0Many of\u00a0Henri Christophe&#8217;s contemporaries noted his ruthlessness, and it is unknown how many laborers died during the palace&#8217;s construction. Under his reign, the palace was the site of opulent feasts and dances. It had immense gardens, artificial springs, and a system of waterworks.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Though Sans-Souci is now an empty ruin, at the time its splendor was noted by many foreign visitors. One American physician remarked that it had &#8220;the reputation of having been one of the most magnificent edifices of the West Indies.&#8221;<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><br \/>\n<\/sup>Close to the Palace is the renowned mountaintop fortress; the\u00a0Citadelle Laferri\u00e8re, built under a decree by\u00a0Henri Christophe\u00a0to repel a feared French invasion that never occurred. It is reached by continuing on the trail behind the Palace.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Crippled by a\u00a0stroke, then\u00a0King Henri I\u00a0committed suicide on the grounds of the palace on October 8, 1820. According to Haitian legend, he shot himself with a silver bullet. He was subsequently buried in the Citadelle. The gun is in the National Museum in PaP.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">His son and heir,\u00a0Jacques-Victor Henry, Prince Royal of Haiti\u00a0was bayoneted to death by revolutionaries at the Palace on October 18, 1820.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">A severe earthquake in 1842\u00a0destroyed a considerable part of the palace and devastated the nearby city of\u00a0Cap-Ha\u00eftien; the palace was never rebuilt.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The palace shares its name with another Haitian revolutionary leader,\u00a0Colonel Jean-Baptiste Sans Souci. He was an African slave who may have taken his name from the\u00a0<i>quartier<\/i>\u00a0near the parish of Grande Rivi\u00e8re where he first led troops in guerrilla fighting against the French in 1791. When\u00a0Henri Christophe\u00a0and other military leaders split from the French, they asked Sans Souci to join their ranks, but he declined and particularly viewed Christophe as a traitor. About ten years before the construction of his palace, the future Haitian king sent Colonel Sans Souci a conciliatory message inviting him to one of his headquarters at the main Grand Pr\u00e9 plantation, adjacent to the Milot plantation where he would later build the palace.\u00a0When Sans Souci arrived, Christophe&#8217;s guards bayoneted him and his small band of guards to death.\u00a0Sans Souci Palace was built only a few yards away, or perhaps even exactly over, the place where Sans Souci the man was killed by Christophe.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>Some scholars have also asked whether Christophe took part of his inspiration for the palace from the Prussian king Frederick the Great&#8217;s palace in Potsdam, Sanssouci, a symbol of European Enlightenment achievement. Other scholars argue, the palace&#8217;s architecture is inspired by the\u00a0Boffrand&#8217;s designs for the Ch\u00e2teau de la\u00a0Malgrange\u00a0for\u00a0Leopold, Duke of Lorraine, near\u00a0Nancy.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In any event, the palace&#8217; splendor was remarked upon by various visitors, generally acknowledged by many to be the\u00a0Caribbean\u00a0equivalent to the\u00a0Palace of Versailles\u00a0in\u00a0France. Proud of its magnificence, the Palace of Sans-Souci was an important step in Henri Christophe&#8217;s plan to demonstrate to foreigners, particularly Europeans and Americans, the power and capability of the black race. The African pride in the construction of the king&#8217;s palace was captured by the comment of his advisor and architect,\u00a0Pomp\u00e9e Valentin Vastey\u00a0(Baron Valentin de Vastey), who said that the palace and its nearby church, &#8220;erected by descendants of Africans, show that we have not lost the architectural taste and genius of our ancestors who covered Ethiopia, Egypt,\u00a0Carthage, and old Spain with their superb monuments.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">UNESCO\u00a0designated it\u2014and the Citadelle\u2014World Heritage Sites\u00a0in 1982. Described as &#8220;one of the most remarkable attractions in the Western Hemisphere&#8221;, the Palace of Sans-Souci is &#8220;seldom visited by foreigners&#8221; due to &#8220;decades of political instability and lawlessness&#8221; in Haiti.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><em>We had arranged a driver, the entrance, moto and horse at the hotel for $140 for both of us but decided it would be more fun, and much cheaper to do it alone. At the market we found a tuk-tuks to the Citadel and were offered anything from $100 to $20. Frandy Stolen (WatsApp +509 34152699) was a gem of a guy who drove us the 20 km to Milot, waited for us, and drove us back for $20.<br \/>\n<\/em>The palace is in the town of Milot. We paid $10 each to enter (but in retrospect, I think there is no fee and the charge is for a guide). Jaime is a soft touch. Then the hard bargaining began. Starting at $100, we bargained him down to $40 for the moto, guide, and one horse.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The palace is a complete ruin. The stone\/brick edifice is 3 stories but the floors and roof are all gone. The grounds have several other ruined buildings including a hospital and a pool.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Citadelle Laferri\u00e8re<\/b>\u00a0(Citadelle Henri Christophe, or simply\u00a0the Citadelle), is a large early 19th-century\u00a0fortress\u00a0situated on the Bonnet \u00e0 l&#8217;Ev\u00eaque mountaintop in\u00a0Nord,\u00a0Haiti.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>\u00a0The imposing structure is located approximately 27 km south of the city of\u00a0Cap-Ha\u00eftien, 15 km southwest of the\u00a0Three Bays Protected Area, and 8 km uphill from the town of\u00a0Milot. Commissioned by\u00a0Haitian revolutionary\u00a0Henri Christophe, and built by tens of thousands of former slaves,<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>\u00a0the Citadelle was the linchpin of the newly independent Haiti&#8217;s defensive strategy against potential French incursion.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><sup id=\"cite_ref-auto_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>Including several smaller forts across the country, the stronghold remains the only African-derived military fortification in the\u00a0New World\u00a0as well as the first example of African-derived colonial architecture; which it shares with\u00a0Sans-Souci Palace, also commissioned by Christophe. Designated by\u00a0UNESCO\u00a0as a\u00a0World Heritage Site\u00a0in 1982\u2014along with the aforementioned Sans-Souci, the fortress is universally regarded as an icon of the Caribbean nation.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"thumbimage\" src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6f\/Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_back_wall.jpg\/300px-Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_back_wall.jpg\" srcset=\"\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6f\/Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_back_wall.jpg\/450px-Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_back_wall.jpg 1.5x, \/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6f\/Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_back_wall.jpg\/600px-Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_back_wall.jpg 2x\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" data-file-width=\"2592\" data-file-height=\"1944\" \/><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Commissioned in 1805 by\u00a0Henri Christophe\u00a0and completed in 1820, the fortress was built as part of a system of fortifications designed to thwart potential foreign incursions; notably the French. During the stronghold&#8217;s conceptual phase, Christophe was a general in the Haitian army and chief administrator of the country&#8217;s northern regions. The ensuing power struggle he had with his rival and fellow revolutionary\u00a0Alexandre P\u00e9tion, would result in his self-declaration as king of Northern Haiti in 1811.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The Citadelle, constructed by over 20,000 ex-slaves, was built several kilometres inland atop the 900-metre (3,000\u00a0ft) Bonnet \u00e0 l\u2019Eveque mountain, as a means of providing the optimal military vantage point. The location enabled Haitian forces to strategically keep watch over a vast distance, from the nearby valleys to the coastline.\u00a0Cap-Ha\u00eftien and the adjoining Atlantic Ocean are visible from the roof of the fortress. It is the largest fortress in Haiti and one of the largest in the New World; it continues to serve as a symbol of Haitian independence.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The Haitians outfitted the fortress with 365 cannons of varying size, assembled from the abandoned munitions left behind by the European forces that formerly occupied the island. The enormous stockpiles of 8,000 cannonballs still sit in pyramidal stacks at the base of the fortress walls. Since its construction, the fortress has withstood numerous earthquakes, though a French attack never came and it was eventually abandoned.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In the event of an invasion, Christophe planned to have his military burn the valuable\u00a0crops\u00a0and food stocks along the coast, then retreat to the fortress, setting\u00a0ambushes\u00a0along the sole mountain path leading to the Citadelle.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Christophe suffered a stroke in 1820, and some of his troops mutinied. Shortly afterwards, he committed\u00a0suicide\u2014according to legend, by shooting himself with a silver bullet.\u00a0Loyal followers covered his body in\u00a0quicklime\u00a0and entombed it in one of the Citadelle&#8217;s interior courtyards to prevent others from mutilating the corpse.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>The colossal physical dimensions of the fortress have made it a Haitian national symbol, featured on\u00a0currency,\u00a0stamps, and tourist ministry posters. The fortress walls rise 40 metres (130\u00a0ft) from the mountaintop and the entire complex, including cannonball stocks but excluding the surrounding grounds, covers an area of 10,000 square metres (110,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft). Workers laid the large foundation stones of the fortress directly into the stone of the mountaintop, using a mortar mixture that included\u00a0quicklime,\u00a0molasses, and the blood of local cows and goats\u2014and cows hooves that they cooked to a glue and added to the mix to give the mortar added strength and bonding power.<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"thumbimage\" src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/0\/0c\/Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_3.jpg\/300px-Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_3.jpg\" srcset=\"\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/0\/0c\/Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_3.jpg\/450px-Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_3.jpg 1.5x, \/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/0\/0c\/Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_3.jpg 2x\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"195\" data-file-width=\"496\" data-file-height=\"323\" \/><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Cannonball stockpiles, viewed from the roof<br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"thumbimage\" src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/d4\/Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_Aerial_View.jpg\/300px-Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_Aerial_View.jpg\" srcset=\"\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/d4\/Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_Aerial_View.jpg\/450px-Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_Aerial_View.jpg 1.5x, \/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/d4\/Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_Aerial_View.jpg\/600px-Citadelle_Laferri%C3%A8re_Aerial_View.jpg 2x\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" data-file-width=\"3022\" data-file-height=\"2015\" \/><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Citadelle Laferri\u00e8re aerial view from a US Army\u00a0UH-60 Black Hawk\u00a0during\u00a0Operation Unified Response, after the\u00a02010 Haiti Earthquake<br \/>\nLarge\u00a0cisterns\u00a0and storehouses in the fortress&#8217;s interior were designed to store enough food and water for 5,000 defenders for up to one year. The fortress included palace quarters for the king and his family, in the event that they needed to take refuge within its walls. Other facilities included\u00a0dungeons, bathing quarters, and\u00a0bakery\u00a0ovens. Also visible is the tomb of Christophe&#8217;s brother-in-law, killed when the\u00a0gunpowder\u00a0room he was in exploded.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The Citadelle&#8217;s appearance from the trail leading up to its base has been likened to the\u00a0prow\u00a0of a great stone ship, jutting out from the mountainside. The structure is angular and assumes different geometric forms based on the viewer&#8217;s orientation. Some of the angles on the Citadelle were intentionally put there by Christophe to deviate cannonballs if attacked and the Epaulette is a great example of using angles to deviate and deflect shots. Though most of the fortress has no roof as such (the interior top is a\u00a0latticework\u00a0of stone walkways), some slanted portions are adorned with bright red tiles. The fortress has been repaired and refurnished several times since its construction, including in the 1980s with help from\u00a0UNESCO\u00a0and the\u00a0World Monuments Fund, though little of it has been replaced and its design remains the same.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Tourism.\u00a0The Citadelle is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Haiti. Directions to and history of the fortress are provided by self-appointed guides from the town of Milot. Near the entrance to Sans-Souci Palace, which is at the start of the trail to the Citadelle, visitors may be asked to pay a small fee. Visitors are also encouraged to rent a\u00a0horse\u00a0for the uphill trek. The first portion of the 11 kilometre (7 mi) trail is navigable by\u00a04WD\u00a0vehicle, although infrequent\u00a0landslides\u00a0and construction projects sometimes make this unreliable. Numerous people live along the trail and sell souvenirs or drinks, such as fresh\u00a0coconut\u00a0juice, to travelers. Drinks are a necessity in the tropical heat. There were also &#8220;bamboo&#8221; players (a digerido-like instrument and a flute player.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The trail is paved stone, generally smooth and in good condition. About three-quarters of the way up from the parking lot, visitors must complete the final portion on horseback or on foot. The entire 11-kilometre (7 mi) trail, starting in Milot, is almost completely uphill, but can be walked by experienced hikers who carry plenty of water. Most of the interior of the Citadelle fortress itself is accessible to visitors, who may also climb the numerous staircases to the fortress&#8217;s roof, which is free of guardrails.\u00a0On a clear day, the city of\u00a0Cap-Ha\u00eftien\u00a0and the Atlantic Ocean can be seen to the north.

Jean-Jacques Desalines\u00a0<\/strong>(1758\u20131806) initially served as an officer in the French Army, but became a commander in the revolt against France and subsequently the leader of the Haitian Revolution. He defeated the French army in 1803 and declared Haiti an independent nation in 1804. This officially ended the only slave rebellion in world history that successfully resulted in establishing an independent nation. Dessalines was chosen by a council of generals to assume the office of Governor-General. He ordered the 1804 Haiti massacre of the white Haitian minority, resulting in the deaths of between 3,000 and 5,000 people. In 1804, he proclaimed himself Emperor Jacques I of Haiti and ruled in that capacity until being assassinated in 1806. Dessalines is regarded as a founding father of Haiti.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Le Marron Inconnu<\/strong> (The Unknown Maroon&#8221;)is a\u00a0bronze\u00a0statue\u00a0of a\u00a0runaway slave, better known as a maroon, standing in the center of\u00a0Port-au-Prince,\u00a0Haiti. Completed on September 22 1967 by Haitian architect\u00a0Albert Mangon\u00e8s, the statue is regarded as a symbol of\u00a0black\u00a0liberation;\u00a0commemorating in particular, the rallying cry that sparked the\u00a0Haitian Revolution\u00a0and the abolishment of\u00a0slavery.

He holds a\u00a0conch shell\u00a0at his lips with his left hand, his head tilted upward to blow it, while the other hand holds a\u00a0machete\u00a0on the ground by his right ankle.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Mangon\u00e8s chose a passage from\u00a01 Maccabees\u00a014:3-9 of the\u00a0Jerusalem Bible\u00a0to be set in\u00a0copper\u00a0letters on one of the two concrete panels that protect the &#8220;eternal flame&#8221; of freedom in the square surrounding the statue.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Atis Rezistans,<\/strong> In the NM Bizzarium series, on<span class=\"section-start-text\">\u00a0<\/span>Boulevard Jn J Dessalines set back from the main road behind a muddle of motorbikes and old cars, the wrought iron gate which marks the entrance is presided over by a human skull, red and white Christmas lights poking\u00a0gaudily\u00a0from its gaping eye sockets. Beneath the skull, a Latin slogan reads: \u201cE Pluribus Unum\u201d;\u00a0<em>out of many, one<\/em>.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The place is a\u00a0museum, an art collection, and a gallery. No matter what you call it, this courtyard tucked away behind the boulevard\u00a0seems to defy any standard definition. The\u00a0open-air space is crammed full of sculptures, ranging from palm-sized figurines through to towering daemonic effigies that hunch menacingly over the heads of visitors.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">If there is one uniting theme to this collection, other than the artists\u2019 obvious penchant for the macabre, then it is the notion of salvage and recycling. The founding sculptors of the Haitian collective, Andr\u00e9 and Celeur, grew up around the area of Grand Rue in Port-au-Prince. Born out of a climate of \u201cjunkyard make-do, survivalist recycling, and artistic endeavor,\u201d their self-taught artistic skills reflect the challenges of growing up in\u00a0such an\u00a0environment. Theirs is a unique and yet well-defined artistic style, one which prescribes\u00a0the juxtaposition\u00a0of metal and flesh, wood and bone. The work of the Grand Rue sculptors is often challenging. Disturbing, even. Children\u2019s dolls appear stitched onto vacuum cleaners, while twisted automobile parts\u00a0have been joined to\u00a0human remains to create bizarre and otherworldly totems.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Now working with an expanded team of sculptors and artists, Andr\u00e9 and Celeur continue to use everyday items to tell new stories. The symbology of their work incorporates powerful themes of death and rebirth; of Vodou, Christianity and occultism; of slavery, of inevitable industrialization and its\u00a0dystopian sci-fi aftermath.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><em>From Debjeet Sen&#8217;s excellent trip report on FB Every Passport Stamp.<\/em><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">It is possible to have a safe and interesting visit to Haiti, if you go with the correct people and are aware of the security situation.

Since he is the general manager of a good hotel he lives in a back building and has permanent access to their electricity and expensive hotels use power nearly 24h, so I didn&#8217;t even realize that the city has a power problem. However, as he had friends coming from Port au Prince, I had to move and the cheapest private place I could find, which was an Airbnb for 40$. There&#8217;s also a hostel for 20$\/night. However, my Airbnb host rarely used the generator so I moved to a hotel with AC (50$), but also the hotel was stingy with the gas and I only had electricity from 11pm-4am. And that was the biggest problem, because I could not sleep well if I don&#8217;t even have a fan at 30C+.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">See my trip summary here:\u00a0https:\/\/youtu.be\/6W47dorKw08 (real Haiti)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">and the video of the most beautiful parts here:\u00a0https:\/\/youtu.be\/ApyjDPNh4vs<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><br \/>\nOrest Zub<br \/>\n<\/strong>Travel independently.

Meanwhile their guiding offers and horse rides where not pushy at all.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><em>Inconveniences. <\/em>The most challenging in Haiti is probably finding proper food.

The capital is\u00a0Port-au-Prince.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The island was originally inhabited by the indigenous\u00a0Ta\u00edno\u00a0people, who originated in South America.\u00a0The first Europeans arrived on 5 December 1492 during the\u00a0first voyage\u00a0of\u00a0Christopher Columbus, who initially believed he had found\u00a0India\u00a0or\u00a0China.\u00a0Columbus subsequently founded the first European settlement in the Americas,\u00a0La Navidad, on what is now the northeastern coast of Haiti.\u00a0The island was claimed by\u00a0Spain\u00a0and named\u00a0<span title=\"Spanish-language text\"><i lang=\"es\">La Espa\u00f1ola<\/i><\/span>, forming part of the\u00a0Spanish Empire\u00a0until the early 17th century.

French colonists established lucrative\u00a0sugarcane\u00a0plantations, worked by vast numbers of slaves brought from Africa, which made the colony one of the richest in the world.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In the midst of the\u00a0French Revolution\u00a0(1789\u201399), slaves and\u00a0free people of color\u00a0launched the\u00a0Haitian Revolution\u00a0(1791\u20131804), led by a former slave and the first black general of the\u00a0French Army,\u00a0Toussaint Louverture. After 12 years of conflict,\u00a0Napoleon Bonaparte&#8217;s forces were defeated by Louverture&#8217;s successor,\u00a0Jean-Jacques Dessalines\u00a0(later Emperor Jacques I), who declared Haiti&#8217;s sovereignty on 1 January 1804\u2014the first independent\u00a0nation\u00a0of\u00a0Latin America\u00a0and the\u00a0Caribbean, the second\u00a0republic\u00a0in the Americas, the first country in the Americas to abolish slavery, and the only state in history established by a successful\u00a0slave revolt.\u00a0Apart from\u00a0Alexandre P\u00e9tion, the first President of the Republic, all of Haiti&#8217;s first leaders were former slaves.\u00a0After a brief period in which the country was split in two, President\u00a0Jean-Pierre Boyer\u00a0united the country and then attempted to bring the whole of Hispaniola under Haitian control, precipitating a long series of wars that ended in the 1870s when Haiti formally recognized the independence of the Dominican Republic.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Haiti&#8217;s first century of independence was characterized by political instability, ostracism by the international community, and the payment of crippling debt to France. Political volatility and foreign economic influence in the country prompted the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0to\u00a0occupy the country from 1915 to 1934. Following a series of short-lived presidencies,\u00a0Fran\u00e7ois &#8216;Papa Doc&#8217; Duvalier\u00a0took power in 1956, ushering in a long period of autocratic rule continued by his son,\u00a0Jean-Claude &#8216;Baby Doc&#8217; Duvalier, that lasted until 1986; the period was characterized by state-sanctioned violence against the opposition and civilians, corruption, and economic stagnation. After 1986, Haiti began attempting to establish a more democratic political system.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Historically poor and politically unstable, Haiti has the lowest\u00a0Human Development Index\u00a0in the Americas. Since the turn of the 21st century, the country has endured a\u00a0coup d&#8217;\u00e9tat, which prompted\u00a0U.N. intervention, as well as\u00a0a catastrophic earthquake\u00a0that killed over 250,000 people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><i>Haiti<\/i>\u00a0(also earlier\u00a0<i>Hayti<\/i>)\u00a0comes from the indigenous\u00a0Ta\u00edno\u00a0language, in which it means &#8220;land of high mountains&#8221;\u00a0and named\u00a0the entire island of\u00a0Hispaniola.

Less than a quarter of the country has electric coverage.\u00a0Most regions of Haiti that do have energy are powered by generators. These generators are often expensive and produce a lot of pollution. The areas that do get electricity experience power cuts on a daily basis, and some areas are limited to 12 hours of electricity a day. Electricity is provided by a small number of independent companies: Sogener, E-power, and Haytrac.\u00a0There is no national electricity grid within the country.\u00a0The most common source of energy used is wood, along with charcoal. In Haiti, about 4 million metric tons of wood products are consumed yearly.\u00a0Like charcoal and wood, petroleum is also an important source of energy for Haiti.
