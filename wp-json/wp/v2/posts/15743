Also, there are open connections to these circuits integrating information from other areas of the brain.<br \/>\nThere are five defined frontostriatal circuits: motor and oculomotor circuits originating in the frontal eye fields are involved in motor functions; while dorsolateral prefrontal, orbital frontal, and anterior cingulate circuits are involved in executive functions, social behavior and motivational states.\u00a0These five circuits share same anatomical structures.<br \/>\nIt was found that\u00a0self-esteem\u00a0is related to the connectivity of frontostriatal circuits, suggesting that feelings of self-worth may emerge from neural systems which integrate information about the self with positive affect and reward.<br \/>\nThese circuits are involved in neurodegenerative disorders such as\u00a0Alzheimer&#8217;s disease\u00a0and\u00a0Parkinson&#8217;s disease\u00a0as well as neuropsychiatric disorders including\u00a0schizophrenia,\u00a0depression,\u00a0obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism.<br \/>\n<strong>Ventromedial prefrontal circuit.<\/strong> Connects the pre-frontal cortex to the ventral striatum and amygdala and is important in affective-emotional processing.

This prevents information overload, the misinterpretation of sensory information, and facilitates mental and behavioral integration. This enables coherent thought \u2013 the uninterrupted processing of the most salient aspects of the external and internal environment.<br \/>\nFiltering out relevant from irrelevant information is deficient in multiple\u00a0neuropsychiatric disorders including autism and Asperger\u2019s syndrome, schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder.<br \/>\nPrepulse inhibition\u00a0(PPI) is a measure of sensorimotor gating, in which response, or startle, to a stimulus (pulse) is diminished when the stimulus is preceded by a smaller stimulus (prepulse). Disruption of this normal inhibition of startle is consistent with deficient sensorimotor gating.<br \/>\nAn important mechanism involved in regulating sleep is\u00a0<span class=\"topic-highlight\">sensory gating<\/span>. In mammals, the thalamus is thought to gate\u00a0sensory input, such that sensory information is processed at a subcortical level during sleep and wakefulness.\u00a0Such mechanisms would protect sleep continuity as stimuli from minor noises would be filtered out and not reach the cortex to disturb sleep.<br \/>\n<strong>Schizophrenia<\/strong><em>.<\/em>\u00a0A key cognitive symptom in patients with schizophrenia is impaired sensroy gating, defined as reduced ability to suppress processing of irrelevant and uninformative sensory input. \u201c<span class=\"topic-highlight\">Sensory gating<\/span>\u201d is said to be the central event in explaining the underlying pathophysiology\u00a0of delusions and hallucinations in\u00a0schizophrenia. It is measured by PPI in which the prepulse is thought to evoke inhibitory mechanisms that limit response to further stimulation until the stimulation is fully processed.<br \/>\n<strong>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\u00a0<\/strong>(OCD) is a severe, chronic psychiatric disorder with 2\u20133% prevalence worldwide. Sensorimotor gating as measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI) is abnormal in OCD. Obsessions are thought to arise from the inability to inhibit undesired thoughts and images, and compulsions from the inability to inhibit repetitive acts or reactions to uncontrollable obsessive thoughts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Asberger&#8217;s Syndrome<br \/>\nAbstract<br \/>\n<\/strong>Asperger\u2019s syndrome (an autistic disorder) is characterized by stereotyped and obsessional behaviours, and pervasive abnormalities in socio\u2010emotional and communicative behaviour. These symptoms lead to social exclusion and a significant healthcare burden; however, their neurobiological basis is poorly understood.<br \/>\nThere are few studies on brain anatomy of Asperger\u2019s syndrome, and no focal anatomical abnormality has been reliably reported from brain imaging studies of autism, although there is increasing evidence for differences in limbic circuits. These brain regions are important in sensorimotor gating, and impaired \u2018gating\u2019 may partly explain the failure of people with autistic disorders to inhibit repetitive thoughts and actions.<br \/>\nThus, we compared brain anatomy and sensorimotor gating in healthy people with Asperger\u2019s syndrome and controls. We included 21 adults with Asperger\u2019s syndrome and 24 controls. All had normal IQ and were aged 18\u201349 years. We studied brain anatomy using quantitative MRI, and sensorimotor gating using prepulse inhibition of startle in a subset of 12 individuals with Asperger\u2019s syndrome and 14 controls.<br \/>\nWe found significant age\u2010related differences in the volume of cerebral hemispheres and caudate nuclei. Controls, but not people with Asperger\u2019s syndrome, had age\u2010related reductions in volume. Also, people with Asperger\u2019s syndrome had significantly less grey matter in frontostriatal and cerebellar regions than controls, and widespread differences in white matter.<br \/>\nMoreover, sensorimotor gating was significantly impaired in Asperger\u2019s syndrome. People with Asperger\u2019s syndrome most likely have generalized alterations in brain development, but this is associated with significant differences from controls in the anatomy and function of specific brain regions implicated in behaviours characterizing the disorder. We hypothesize that Asperger\u2019s syndrome is associated with abnormalities in fronto\u2010striatal pathways resulting in defective sensorimotor gating, and consequently characteristic difficulties inhibiting repetitive thoughts, speech and actions.<\/p>\n<p>Developmental disorders that lie on the autistic spectrum, including the genetically related subtypes of classical autism and Asperger\u2019s syndrome, are characterized by stereotyped and obsessional behaviours, and pervasive abnormalities in socio\u2010emotional and communicative behaviour. Individuals with classical autism have delayed language development, and most have mental retardation (learning disability). Individuals with Asperger\u2019s syndrome have no history of language delay and have normal or superior intellectual abilities, but still show characteristic impairments in reciprocal social interaction. Thus, in Asperger\u2019s syndrome, there is the dissociation between cognitive and social skills. However, the neurobiological determinants of the behavioural phenotype of Asperger\u2019s syndrome are poorly understood.<\/p>\n<p>In one of the very few studies of Asperger\u2019s syndrome,\u00a0Abell\u00a0et al. (1999)\u00a0investigated grey matter differences between a group of adults with Asperger\u2019s and matched controls. They noted grey matter anomalies in the cerebellum, and in medial temporal and frontal lobe structures. These findings fit broadly with a growing consensus that limbic system and cerebellar abnormalities may be important determinants of autism. For example,\u00a0Damasio and Maurer (1978)\u00a0suggested that developmental abnormalities in a limbic circuit comprising medial prefrontal cortex and temporal lobe, striatum and limbic thalamus underlie autism. This theory has been supported by studies reporting: delayed metabolic maturation and dysfunction of frontal and temporal circuitry; decreased correlated metabolic activity between frontal\u2010parietal and cortical\u2010subcortical regions; and volume differences in fronto\u2010temporal regions\u00a0 and caudate nuclei. We therefore restricted the present study to adults with Asperger\u2019s syndrome to clarify neuroanatomical changes in an autistic spectrum disorder uncomplicated by confounds of IQ.<\/p>\n<p>The limbic circuitry, proposed by some as the biological substrate of autism, plays an important role in sensorimotor gating. We use this mechanism to supress motor responses to irrelevant stimuli, and it is possible that similar processes underlie cognitive gating. A measure of sensorimotor gating is prepulse inhibition of startle (PPI), in which the startle response to a strong stimulus is muted or inhibited when momentarily preceded by a weak stimulus (the prepulse). We hypothesized that people with an autistic spectrum disorder may have defective sensorimotor gating, reflecting their characteristic inability to inhibit or \u2018gate\u2019 repetitive thoughts, speech and actions. However, to date, there have been no studies using PPI in adults with Asperger\u2019s syndrome.<\/p>\n<p>Thus there is evidence that people with an autistic spectrum disorder may have abnormalities in brain anatomy, including regions responsible for sensorimotor gating. However, there are relatively few studies of healthy, non\u2010learning disabled people who lie on this spectrum. We therefore used quantitative MRI in what we believe to be the first comprehensive study of brain anatomy in unmedicated, intellectually able adults with Asperger\u2019s syndrome and healthy controls of comparable age, IQ, gender and handedness. We also carried out a pilot study of sensorimotor gating using PPI. We hypothesized that people with Asperger\u2019s syndrome would have differences in the anatomy and function of limbic circuitry.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussion<br \/>\n<\/strong>We believe that this is the first study to quantify MRI differences in both regional brain volumes and grey and white matter volumes in Asperger\u2019s syndrome and to investigate age-related differences in these parameters. Similar to others (Courchesne\u00a0et al., 1999), we found that megaloencephaly is not a universal feature of autistic spectrum disorders, and we detected no bulk regional brain volume differences between Asperger\u2019s syndrome and controls using manual tracing. Past reports of megaloencephaly in autism may therefore reflect an effect of disease severity (e.g. mental retardation) that is not evident in the Asperger\u2019s sample we studied. We also found that age\u2010related differences in whole brain and grey matter volume in the controls were not evident in people with Asperger\u2019s syndrome. The reason for this is unknown, but may include neurodevelopmental differences in neurogenesis and programmed cell death.<\/p>\n<p>Our main findings were that people with Asperger\u2019s syndrome had significant reductions in grey matter volume of frontostriatal and cerebellar regions. In addition, people with Asperger\u2019s syndrome had white matter excesses bilaterally around the basal ganglia, whereas they had deficits mainly in the left hemisphere. The concentration of abnormalities in frontostriatal circuitry we observed most likely has functional consequences. PPI is thought to depend in part on intact fronto\u2010striatal pathways, and we report for the first time a significant impairment in sensorimotor gating in Asperger\u2019s syndrome.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fronto\u2010striatal systems in Asperger\u2019s syndrome.\u00a0<\/strong>Our finding of reduced grey matter in the medial frontal lobe of people with Asperger\u2019s syndrome is in agreement with other neuroanatomical studies of autism. In contrast, a recent MRI study of basal ganglia size in autism found that volume of the caudate nucleus was increased in subjects with autism and this increase was proportional to an increase in total brain volume. However, we observed a reduction in grey matter in the basal ganglia in people with Asperger\u2019s syndrome and no increase in caudate or whole-brain volume. Important differences between our studies may explain these disparate findings. The\u00a0Sears\u00a0et al. (1999)\u00a0study included children and adults with performance IQs ranging from 52 to 136; the control group had IQs &gt;70. We only studied adults with an IQ &gt;75, and we also identified significant age\u2010related differences in brain anatomy between people with Asperger\u2019s and controls. Thus our results may differ due to the specific population we studied, in addition to confounds introduced by age and IQ.<\/p>\n<p>Frontal and striatal brain regions are reciprocally connected to each other and the thalamus proposed that dysfunction in a system incorporating the basal ganglia and mesial frontal lobe is responsible for the clinical symptoms of autism, including motor disturbances such as dystonia, bradykinesia and hyperkinesias, and impaired social communication. Their model also predicted temporal lobe abnormalities in autism. Although we did not identify grey matter deficits in the temporal lobe at the level of significance we adopted, we did observe extensive white matter deficits in the left temporal lobe. Ours is the first study to report abnormalities in the anatomy of this entire neural system in people with an autistic spectrum disorder, and we suggest that our anatomical findings are consistent with Damasio and Maurer\u2019s model.<\/p>\n<p>The fronto\u2010striatal regions we identified as abnormal are known to have intimate and reciprocal links with the cerebellum, and the cerebellum has been implicated in higher-order cognitive functions, including executive functions such as planning and shifting attention. Thus, the anomalies we found within the cerebellum, a region anatomically and functionally related to the basal ganglia and frontal cortex, are not surprising. Our study, therefore, lends tentative support for the hypothesis that abnormalities in the cerebellum may be related to the behavioural phenotype of people with an autistic spectrum disorder, but in our view cerebellar pathology may best be viewed in the context of system\u2010wide pathology, rather than in isolation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sensorimotor gating in Asperger\u2019s syndrome.\u00a0<\/strong>There is consensus that alterations in fronto\u2010striatal regions (as found in our study of people with Asperger\u2019s syndrome) underlie impaired sensorimotor gating in a range of neuropsychiatric conditions such as obsessive compulsive disorder, Huntington\u2019s disease, Tourette\u2019s syndrome, and schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The argument is perhaps most persuasive for Huntington\u2019s disease, as this is associated with significant damage to the caudate nucleus. Recent functional imaging data support this position, with activation in the prefrontal cortex and caudate nuclei being observed during PPI in healthy individuals. We suggest that the reduction in grey matter volume of fronto\u2010striatal regions we identified in people with Asperger\u2019s may also explain our finding of impaired PPI in this group. Our findings are unlikely to be explained by differences in schizotypal traits, as the control and Asperger\u2019s groups were comparable in this regard.<\/p>\n<p>We explored PPI in a population of intellectually able, healthy, adult men with Asperger\u2019s and found significant impairment of PPI in the 120 ms\/16 db condition. Again, we may find differences where others do not due to differences in our study populations.<\/p>\n<p>The occurrence of sensorimotor gating abnormalities in a number of disorders, as noted above, could simply mean that PPI is a task sensitive to fronto\u2010striatal damage, but differences may not be specific to Asperger\u2019s syndrome.<br \/>\nHowever, sensorimotor gating deficits in autism may reflect similar difficulties with cognitive gating, rendering the individual unable to inhibit or \u2018gate\u2019 the repetitive thoughts, speech and actions characteristic of the disorder. The subsequent information \u2018overload\u2019 may lead to higher cognitive difficulties, such as executive function and \u2018theory of mind\u2019 (ToM) abnormalities, reported by others in autism.<br \/>\nToM and executive function accounts of autism together explain quite well the socio\u2010communicative and flexibility problems in this disorder. However, neither account can explain why people with autism are so good at certain tasks.<br \/>\nAutism presents a strikingly uneven cognitive profile, with typical peaks on Wechsler block design and digit span. One theoretical account of autism attempts to explain these skills in terms of a bias towards featural versus configural processing. This cognitive style of \u2018weak central coherence\u2019 is demonstrated through success of individuals with autism on tasks favouring detail focus, and relative inability on tasks requiring processing of information in context for global form or meaning. Impaired sensorimotor gating permits stimuli indiscriminate access to response output systems without regard for the context of presentation. This is reflected in reduced PPI: the startle response to a given stimulus is not modulated by preceding stimuli. Conceivably, the stimulus which elicits inappropriate startle has been subject to a form of featural processing. We therefore suggest that abnormal gating may contribute to the physiological basis of weak central coherence in autistic spectrum disorders.<\/p>\n<p><strong>White matter deficits and excesses in Asperger\u2019s syndrome.\u00a0<\/strong>We found widespread white matter anomalies in the brain of people with Asperger\u2019s syndrome; indeed white matter projections to and from abnormal grey matter structures might be expected to be deviant. However, while white matter excesses were distributed bilaterally, deficits appeared to be more prominent in the left hemisphere. This hemisphere normally develops later than the right and, perhaps as a consequence of evolving speech pathways, fronto\u2010temporal pathways reach maturation later than those linking lower order regions. Thus neuro\u2010developmental delay in autism may particularly impact on the left hemisphere and consequently explain some of the developmental language anomalies found in the disorder. For example, we found significant fronto\u2010temporal white matter deficits in people with Asperger\u2019s syndrome, including the left superior temporal lobe speech area.<\/p>\n<p>Courchesne\u00a0et al. (2001)\u00a0recently investigated developmental changes in grey and white matter volume in autistic boys. They noted that expanded white matter volumes in 2\u20133 year old children with autism were not found in adolescents with autism. In conjunction with the present findings, this suggests that the autistic brain matures differently, and has a complex and anomalous trajectory affecting both brain development and aging. Courchesne\u2019s group of autistic children had IQs ranging from 36 to 122, while the control group had IQs in the normal range, so it is unclear to what extent the presence of learning disability impacted on their results. Clearly the question of structural brain changes throughout the lifespan of autistic individuals deserves further investigation in well\u2010matched groups.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conclusions<br \/>\n<\/strong>We found that, compared with controls, people with Asperger\u2019s syndrome have age\u2010related differences in brain anatomy, structural abnormalities in fronto\u2010striatal systems and the cerebellum, and impaired sensorimotor gating. We suggest that Asperger\u2019s syndrome probably arises from a generalized abnormality in brain development (causing widespread white matter abnormalities). This neurodevelopmental abnormality may, in turn, be modulated by environmental factors such as social isolation. Some regions are more affected than others, and our findings support the hypothesis that a proportion of autistic symptomatology may be explained by frontostriatal disorder. Further studies are required to examine changes in brain anatomy and function across the lifespan, and to explore their relationship to the behavioural phenotype in people with Asperger\u2019s syndrome.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>FRONTOSTRIATAL CIRCUITS\u00a0are\u00a0neural pathways\u00a0that connect\u00a0frontal lobe\u00a0regions with the\u00a0basal ganglia\u00a0(striatum) that mediate motor, cognitive, and behavioural functions within the\u00a0brain and\u00a0thus modulate information processing.\u00a0Control of executive functions include: selection and perception of important information, manipulation of information in working memory, planning and organization, &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2021\/11\/15\/brain-anatomy-sensorimotor-gating-in-aspergers-syndrome\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-15743","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-uncategorized"],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p2Ncip-45V","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/15743","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=15743"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/15743\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":15752,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/15743\/revisions\/15752"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=15743"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=15743"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=15743"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
