We left the highway some 4.3 km. south of the Burton Store and turned on to the signed Burton Creek FSR. From this point, we followed the accurate directions of Mike of Pope and Talbot in Nakusp, keeping right at km. 2.9 and bearing right at km. 7.2 on the signed Stoney Road. On this, we ascended thousands of feet, ignoring left spurs at km. 11.1 and 11.5. At km. 13.4 we kept left (Branch 13 going right and down) and bore left again at km. 13.7. At km. 21.1 from the highway, we parked at a switchback, as the road veered back north and down. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">From this point on the west side of the long Hilda-Naumulten ridge (about 6,500\u2019 and some 5 km. N. of our goal), we headed out for Naumulten at 10:05, carrying very little gear. We traversed south through easy, open timber and the occasional meadow for about an hour, making for the often visible NE-SW ridge north of our goal. We skirted a broad col at 311-259 giving access to alpine lakes on the Burton Creek side, ascended easy rock and heather to the west, and gained the north-south ridge north of our goal. As we continued south over a subsidiary bump (311- 255), we could see the ski lodge below us near an alpine lake on the west side. An easy walk-up of Naumulten\u2019s north ridge got us to the summit at 1:45 (3 hrs. 35 min. up). <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">We lounged for 55 min. on the broad, flat summit of this nondescript peak, speculating whether a plane could be landed here. Truly, this was a hike to an NMI (no mountaineering interest) peak. The weather was pleasantly cool and breezy as we unsuccessfully inspected the massive cairn for a record and enjoyed an unaccustomed view of the Valhallas from the northwest. At the headwaters of the various fingers of Burton Creek lay Hilda, Lequereux, and Woden, while farther to the east, amid the smoke, Gladsheim, Asgard, Midgard, the Prestleys, and other favourites could be seen. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">We retraced our steps to the truck in 2 hrs. 10 min. to give us about a 6.5-hour day. By 7:30, we were back in Nelson. Not an exciting trip, but we did get a chance to see some new alpine terrain gained via a nearly bushwhack-free access. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Kim Kratky <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>NAUMULTEN MOUNTAIN\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02474m \u00a08118 ft Naumulten Mountain is on the northern end of the Valkyr Range, on the ridge of mountains going north from Hilda Peak.
