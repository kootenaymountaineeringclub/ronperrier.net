Are we so politically &#8216;correct&#8217; that we cannot openly discuss this?? Scary. Marty Skinner is a historian who offers one assessment of the root of the problem the world faces today and likely well into the future. <\/p>\n<p>Syria has had a civil war for almost 5 years. Why all the &#8220;refugees&#8221; NOW and why so all of a SUDDEN and why in such VAST NUMBERS?<\/p>\n<p>This is a highly organized, well-oiled, mobilized invasion of Muslims and Jihadists into the Western World. It&#8217;s been in their plan for a long time. Momar Gadhafi predicted and explicitly stated that Muslim domination of Europe would happen without a conventional war and he said it 30 years ago. 95% of these economic &#8220;refugees&#8221; many who have cellphones are men between the fighting ages of 20 and 40. Very few women and children from everything I&#8217;ve seen.<\/p>\n<p>It is odd that the 5 wealthiest Arab States including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait are taking &#8220;no refugees&#8221; and feel quite self righteous about it. No guilt what so ever? They are even laughing at us for doing so.<\/p>\n<p>Ask yourself, why would Germany Belgium, Holland, France, Sweden and others want to destroy their own cultures from within? It doesn&#8217;t make any sense? If this keeps up Europe will be burning daily within a very short few years if not months. Civil war in the streets between civilizations. Muslims vs Kefirs, that is to say, everyone who is not a Muslim.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the reality is that Muslims are just not like any other immigrants. They don&#8217;t want to assimilate, they want to set up separate enclaves and implement Sharia Law. Another problem is that while the civilized West rightly abhors violence, conversely Muslims daily display their love of violence. They live it and embrace it. In many Muslim countries public beheadings and stoning to death for adultery for example. It&#8217;s a part of their culture precisely because Islam is, dare I say it, a death cult.<\/p>\n<p>Islam is a supremacist, totalitarian, bigoted, fascist political ideology masquerading as a religion. It literally means &#8220;submission&#8221;. The Quran MANDATES death for blasphamy, for adultery, for apostasy, for family honor, for being gay, Jewish or a Kafer as well as ten other &#8220;crimes&#8221; many not even considered to be so in the West. Death for drinking alcohol or taking illegal drugs for example.<\/p>\n<p>Why let in vast numbers of these brainwashed people especially men of that age when past experience has already demonstrated the tragedy, not to mention the financial, social, and political costs of rampant multiculturalism in Europe. Ordinary citizens are against this immigration but strangely, their governments are not?<\/p>\n<p>The major media are implicit in selling gullible citizens of the West the righteousness of the &#8220;refugees&#8221; cause and openly siding against Western culture. One drowned child&#8217;s picture in the right places sparks outrage and sympathy world wide for the movement and resettlement of vast numbers of Muslims.<\/p>\n<p>However the implementation of Sharia Law, No Go Zone ghettos in most countries in Europe and Muslim rape gangs go unreported. In radical Islamist countries honor killings, beheadings, stoning&#8217;s, cutting off limbs, whipping and torture, pedophilia, child bride marriages, rape and misogyny go unreported daily and are dismissed as culturally ingrained.<\/p>\n<p>Where is the indignity and the outrage over people doing this every day to their own populations? Yet a staged picture a drowned baby on a beach sparks a world outcry?<\/p>\n<p>Muslim birthrates are 8 children per family while Europeans average 1.4. When these current millions bring in their multiple wives, children and extended families 85% of whom live on state benefits (England&#8217;s experience) you can multiply their number by at least 10x, maybe 20x or even more.<\/p>\n<p>By 2050 Europe will be Muslim dominated just by demographics alone. When their numbers are sufficient they will legally vote in their own kind and then Sharia Law.<\/p>\n<p>Europe as we know it will be lost forever. Two thousand years of civilization will be destroyed by the same fanatical bearded, bigoted, brutal, boneheaded, belligerent bastards who are now slaughtering their own kind and blowing up ancient and irreplaceable world heritage buildings, monuments, books, manuscripts and other historically significant art treasures in Iraq, Syria and other conquered territories.<\/p>\n<p>Canada should not get sucked into this quagmire of political correctness just to show how polite, civilized. politically correct and Canadian we are. We should learn a lesson from our Australian counterparts.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>ISLAMIC INVASION \u2013 One View by Marty Skinner \u201cThe exodus of Muslims is staged, following the same route, mass all at one time.
