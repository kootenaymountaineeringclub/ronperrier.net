The outlet of the lake is on the shallow north end and forms a rocky delta the entire width of the lake. It funnels into a huge waterfall and passes the campground. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Hike .75km south to the lake for dramatic scenery. Lake of the Hanging Glacier fills a 2.5km oval basin below several glaciers. The jagged Lieutenants to 10,500 feet fill the south skyline. Glacier Dome, a not uncommon destination from the west side of the Purcells fills the west horizon. Jumbo Glacier extends off Commander Glacier and dips well into the end of the lake. Walk to the end and up onto the glacier, covered with gravel debris. Ice regularly calves off the glacier into the lake and the lake is usually dotted with icebergs.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This is one of the most popular hikes in the East Kootenay \u2013 the setting at the end is also one of the most dramatic = 11,000 11,000-foot peaks and Commander Glacier tumbling down the mountainside to end in the &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2017\/12\/13\/lake-of-the-hanging-glacier-trail\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-8818","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-uncategorized"],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p2Ncip-2ie","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8818","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8818"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8818\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":20526,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8818\/revisions\/20526"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8818"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8818"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8818"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
