In the middle ages, it flourished under the Scala clan, both patrons of the arts and murderous tyrants. Between 1308-28, Verona conquered Padua and Vicenza and Dante, Petrarch and Giotto benefitting. The Scalas were run out in 1387 and Venice took control until Napoleon arrived in 1797. Shakespeare staged Romeo and Juliet here. In WWII it was a key location for Resistance interrogation and transit point for Italian Jews sent to Nazi concentration camps.

I am tired of the art with its repetitive religious scenes.<br \/>\n<strong>Duomo.<\/strong> Built in the 12<sup>th<\/sup> century, the interior is completely frescoed, as are the other churches in town.<br \/>\nAlthough Verona is in the province of Veneto, it is only 30kms from Mantua and Brescia.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SOME OBSERVATIONS ON ITALY<br \/>\n<\/strong>I have written about these things before (go to Italy \u2013 General Information) but some things bear repeating.<br \/>\n1. My impression after seeing almost all of Italy is that Italians don\u2019t like to follow rules \u2013 certainly not ones about driving, parking, paying taxes, etc. \u00a0They are after my heart, as I don\u2019t like following rules much either.<br \/>\n<strong>2. Driving.<\/strong> Italians have at least bad habits: a. Following too close. It is not rare to have a vehicle within a car\u2019s length behind you even at high speed on the autostrada. This drives me crazy as it is so dangerous. I routinely put my hand up to try to get them to move back and if that doesn\u2019t work (about half the time), I tap on my brakes. That drives them crazy as they don\u2019t like to be told anything, I have now been swerved in front of and even had attempted to drive me off the road. b. Cutting corners. Because they drive so fast, they are always in your lane on corners. I can\u2019t count the number of times, I have almost had to come to a stop on corners or how many near misses I have had. c. Speeding. I don\u2019t think speed limits matter, certainly not on the autostradas where it is unlimited. One must be very careful on autostradas that are only two-lane as trucks passing are in the fast lanes, and they don\u2019t care about cutting in front and don\u2019t increase their speed when passing. The best way to deal with it is to drive at a good speed (over 120-130kms\/hour) to pass all the trucks and don\u2019t worry about the fast drivers. They will flash their lights, follow too close and make it seem that they have a right to that lane. d. Talking on their phone when driving. This is routine and there must not be a law against it (as there is everywhere in North America). But it creates distracted drivers. Italians love to talk.<br \/>\n<strong>3. Parking.<\/strong> Italy is the double-parking capital of the world. If you parked legally, you would never find a parking spot. Every Italian must have at least one car and parking on the street is their only option. I use unloading zones, sidewalks, handicapped parking, bus parking, just about everything illegal you can imagine. And so far have never gotten a ticket that I know of. But I have never double-parked. Nor have I ever paid for parking.<br \/>\n4. Italians are very nice people as a general rule. As opposed to the French who are simply rude if you don\u2019t speak French, they go out of their way to give directions and help a tourist. And their level of English is much better than the French or Spanish.<\/p>\n<p>Veneto March 15-17, 2019<br \/>\n<strong>Palazzo Grassi,<\/strong> Chioggia. This 4-story white plastered building was built in 1703-14 on the Vena Canal. From 1845-1970, it was the civil hospital and now since 2011, houses the Museum of Zoology Adriatica, full of specimens (all dead) \u2013 sharks, some tropical fish and primarily Adriatic fish. It discusses the loss of biodiversity. The museum is associated with the University of Padua.<br \/>\nHowever, the town of <strong>Chioggia<\/strong> is a beauty. Sitting on an island projecting into the Adriatic, it is full of canals crossed by lovely arched bridges, waterside restaurants and bars. There is an active fishing fleet and a yacht marina. It was 47kms north of Pompasano.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Battaglia Terme,<\/strong> In the NM \u201csmall town series\u201d, this village outside Padua has no discernable interest. I was taken by Google Maps to the closed train station, drove by the unremarkable city hall, saw the Parish church, drove by the canal full of garbage and sat in a nice park with grass and trees.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Praglia Abbey. <\/strong>Teola<strong>.<\/strong> About 10kms west of Padua, I arrived at 3 pm just as the 20 monks started their chant in the choir of the church. It was lovely. The church is quite plain inside with a frescoed apse and dome. Vineyards surround the abbey.<\/p>\n<p><strong>VENICE<\/strong> (pop<br \/>\nThe main city is an island bisected by the Gran Canal. Hundreds of small canals with tiny arched bridges are everywhere. Not many bridges cross the Gran Canal so try to see things on one side then cross over to the other side. The streets are occasionally wide but usually narrow and plazas common. On a Saturday in mid-March, the place seemed very crowded to me. I can only imagine what it would be like in the summer. It is possible to buy anything but ice cream, pastry, pizza\/sandwich and knick-knack stores are a dime a dozen. There are also many high-end galleries\/art stores and many specialty stores. I doubt that there are any bargains here.<br \/>\nFind your way around with a paper map (difficult) or Google Maps (good but there are so many tiny lanes that lose the GPS signal, even this can be challenging.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Tips for Venice<\/strong><\/em><br \/>\n<strong>1. <u>Getting There<\/u>.<\/strong> Venice is an island reached by a causeway with a railway and a road. It is possible to drive into the very outside of Venice, but that is not meant to happen. Parking is limited and very expensive at about \u20ac27 per day. And Venice can only be walked. You cannot drive anywhere in the city. Lanes are very narrow and there are a million tiny canals with arched bridges over them. Park somewhere in Mestre, the city on the landside of the causeway. There is lots of pay parking in parkades but also pay street parking in the neighbourhood. Don\u2019t pay any attention to the touts luring you into their parking lots. I parked in the McDonald&#8217;s\/InterSpar parking lot about 600m away and walked to the Mestre train station (and had a parking ticket on return \u2013 I had no idea it was pay parking). Train tickets are \u20ac1.35 for the 9-minute ride to Venezia Santa Lucia train station at the west end of the island. On return, the station is Venezia Mestre. Do not take a bus. Trains leave every 5-10 minutes.<br \/>\n<strong>2. <u>Venezia Unica City Passes<\/u>.<\/strong> There are three types of museum\/church passes for Venice. Note that St Marks is free. Buy at the train station in Venice (Venezia S Lucia) or online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.veneziaunica.it\">www.veneziaunica.it<\/a> and download the app. Nothing requires a reservation. A significant advantage is that you pass the ticket lines. When bought at the train station, get a piece of paper with a bar code that is scanned.<br \/>\n<em>a<\/em><em>. Museum pass<\/em>. Gives access to 11 museums: Doges Palace, Correr Museum, National Archaeology Museum (enter from Correr Museum), State Monumentali of the Biblioteca Marciana, 18<sup>th<\/sup> Century Venetian Museum \u201cCa\u2019 Rezzonico, Mocenigo Palace, Carlo Goldoni\u2019s House, Ca\u2019 Pesaro \u2013 International Gallery of Modern Art and Oriental Art Museum, Glass Museum (Murano Island), Lace Museum (Burano Island), Natural History Museum, Jewish Museum, Querini Stampalia Foundation. Admissions not included in the pass but are discounted are the Clock Tower and Fortuny Palace. \u20ac24<br \/>\nIt does not include the Peggy Guggenheim Museum or dell\u2019Accademia.<br \/>\nb.<em> San Marco Pass.<\/em> Includes Doge\u2019s Palace and 3 civic museums, 3 churches (all have a \u20ac3 admission if done separately), Querini Stampalla Foundation, Teatro La Fenice (guided tour) and discounts on other museums, shows, shops, bars and restaurants. \u20ac38.90<br \/>\nc. <em>All Venice Pack<\/em>. Includes Doge\u2019s Palace and 10 other Civic Museums, 16 churches, Querini Stampalla Foundation, Jewish Museum, Teatro La Fenice, Discounts as above. \u20ac49.90<br \/>\n<em>I purchased the Museum Pass. Note that only 5 museums and 1 pay-for church are on the NM list, but it is still a reasonable value. <\/em><br \/>\n<strong>3. <u>Boats on the Canals<\/u><\/strong><br \/>\na. <em>Gondola.<\/em> \u20ac80 for 30 minutes; at night \u20ac100. The gondolas are all laquer black with plush seats, the rowers have black and white striped tops and jaunty hats. I was surprised at how busy they were for this price, but when you are on a short holiday, money does not seem to matter much.<br \/>\nb. <em>Water Bus.<\/em> There are obviously no subways or buses in Venice and the water bus serves as the public transportation. There are many routes going everywhere. \u20ac20 for all day or \u20ac7.50 per ride. Probably the best way to tour the canals.<br \/>\nc. <em>Sightseeing boats.<\/em> These are also widely available but I have no idea of the prices.<\/p>\n<p><em>There are many Nomad Mania sites in Venice. I caught the 08:35 train with the hopes of seeing all of them and visited everything in the order listed.<\/em><br \/>\nVenice has two World Heritage Sites. The Venetian Works of Defence are a series of six mainland fortifications surrounding the north Adriatic \u2013 in Italy, Croatia and Montenegro. The second WHS is Venice and its Lagoons.<br \/>\n<strong>Venezia Santa Lucia Train Station<\/strong>. On the west side of the island, this is where you arrive on the train. The Gran Canal is right in front of you. The best place to buy museum passes on the day of your visit.<br \/>\n<strong>Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari.<\/strong> Full of large stucco and marble sculpture, this has a lovely choir screen and some famous art. \u20ac3<br \/>\n<strong>Ca\u2019 Vendramin Calergi<\/strong> (University Library). In an underwhelming building, this is off the tourist path and open Monday to Friday.<br \/>\n<strong>Palazzo Giustinian<\/strong>. The entrance to this is impossible to find and I wasted a lot of time trying to find it. It is next door to University la Foscau, and may be part of the university campus. The fa\u00e7ade could be seen from across the canal.<br \/>\n<strong>Ca\u2019 Rezzonico.<\/strong> This palace has three floors of art, statues, dishes, furniture, porcelain and tapestries. The ceilings are covered in frescoes.<br \/>\n<strong>Gallerie dell\u2019Accademia.<\/strong> With mostly religious art, it is not including in any museum pass. \u20ac12<br \/>\n<strong>Peggy Guggenheim Collection.<\/strong> Unusual for Venice art museums, this is modern art with many abstracts including Jackson Pollock and Braque. It is not included in any museum pass. \u20ac15, \u20ac13 reduced and \u20ac5 for a guide.<br \/>\n<strong>Punta della Dogana.<\/strong> This is the narrow point at the end of a long peninsula that is just out into the lagoon. There are two big churches here. It is a lovely place to sit.<br \/>\nPalazzo Barbarigo (Palazzo Musica). This was not an obvious place (a narrow walk along a canal) and appeared to be an apartment building. A guest house had a sign: \u201cThis is not the Palazzo Musica\u201d.<br \/>\n<strong>Museo Correr.<\/strong> In the Palazzo Reale with frescoed ceilings, furniture and gaudy wallpaper, the exhibits are bronzes, printing, coins, globes and armory. It flows into the Archaeology Museum. The overzealous security check created a long line just to get in for tickets. It was explained that all San Marco Square attractions had similar security, but it was nowhere else.<br \/>\n<strong>Gallerie Museo Archeologico Nazionale.<\/strong> Many statues and sculpture. Not so interesting. There is an art gallery upstairs and a bit on the Carnival. An interesting exhibit was the Games of Hercules with human pyramids and children doing acrobatics on top.<br \/>\n<strong>Caff\u00e8 Florian<\/strong>. A restaurant has been here since the 1700s. Its tables flow out into San Marco Square. Prices were exorbitant: espresso \u20ac6, with cream \u20ac13, tea \u20ac10, cocktails \u20ac16-21, champagne glass \u20ac31, cake \u20ac14.50, ice cream \u20ac14.50, beer \u20ac13, coke \u20ac11.50. Surprisingly it was quite busy inside.<br \/>\n<strong>St. Mark\u2019s Basilica.<\/strong> This is one of those wonderful churches and the line to get in was long. The fa\u00e7ade is all mosaics, columns and statues. Inside it is covered with gold background mosaics above the plain marble walls. The treasury and Pala d\u2019Oro were both \u20ac3. The exit line up was equally long.

The first dry crossing of the Grand Canal was a\u00a0pontoon bridge\u00a0built in 1181.

This structure had two inclined ramps meeting at a movable central section, that could be raised to allow the passage of tall ships. The connection with the market eventually led to a change of name for the bridge. During the first half of the 15th century, two rows of shops were built along the sides of the bridge. The rents brought an income to the State Treasury, which helped maintain the bridge. Maintenance was vital for the\u00a0timber\u00a0bridge. It was partly burnt in a revolt\u00a0in 1310. In 1444, it collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade and it collapsed again in 1524.<br \/>\nThe present\u00a0stone\u00a0bridge, a single span, was finally completed in 1591. It is similar to the wooden bridge it succeeded. Two inclined ramps lead up to a central\u00a0portico.

I then drove back to Padua to see everything before my Scrovegni reservation at 6 pm.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>In south Padua, there is a wonderful park &#8211; an oval moat surrounded by statues and a fountain in the middle. A great flea market was on and I bought a pair of faded Levis with a button fly for\u00a0\u20ac15. They had hundreds of pairs.<\/em>\u00a0The first three things surrounded the park.<br \/>\n<strong>Benedictine Abbey of Santa Giustina.<\/strong> This monster of a church has plain white walls and pillars but wonderful side chapels full of marble, art and stucco statues. The two chapels next to the apse were special &#8211; one had a great fresco ceiling and the other a carved stucco ceiling. The Corridor of the Martyrs had the bones of ancient Christians persecuted for their beliefs. Free<br \/>\n<strong>Botanical Garden of Padua University\u00a0<\/strong>(Orto Botanico).\u00a0Started in 1545 as a source of medicinal plants in the same site it is today, it is the oldest botanical garden in the world. It was UNESCO World Heritage listed in 1996. There are lots of big trees but few were in leaf and there were no flowers &#8211; as in most botanical gardens, all names are genus\/species &#8211; I would like to see the common names. The Garden of Biodiversity is in a large greenhouse with plants categorized according to origin. The dioramas are very well done discussing several plants that formed the backbone of many cultures: rice, bamboo, flax, sago palm, papyrus and paper production, cotton, hemp, rubber, cacao, tobacco. The herbarium has 6000 species in a large round enclosure. \u20ac10,\u00a0\u20ac5 reduced<br \/>\n<strong>Museum of Precinema.<\/strong> Not knowing what to expect, this is one of the best little museums I have ever been to. Representing the collection of Minici Zotti, it shows puppetry around the world, lantern projectors, camera obscura and many types of stereoscopic viewers with a brilliant slide collection. Start with a subtitled video and then get a personal guided tour.\u00a0\u20ac6,\u00a0\u20ac4 reduced<br \/>\n<strong>MUSME<\/strong> &#8211; Museum of Medical History in Padova. Near the town centre, it tells the story of medicine in Padova using interactive exhibits. There is a lot of how the body is structured, works and malfunctions.\u00a0\u20ac10,\u00a0\u20ac8 reduced<br \/>\n<strong>Palazzo Zabarello.<\/strong> In a nice palace on the main street, this was a welcome change from all the religious art with good impressionists.\u00a0\u20ac8, no reduction<br \/>\n<strong>Palazzo della Regione<\/strong> was built in 1218 with porticos added on both sides 100 years later. It sits between two large squares and has a food market on the ground floor. A tour of the archaeological dig happening in the basement is offered on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays at 11,12, 3 and 5. The Salon on the first floor is 81m x 27m by 27m high (the ceiling is a long barrel vault and is frescoed.<br \/>\n<em>I then went to the three civic museums all grouped together near a park, included in the Padua Viva ticket. Most of the labels are in Italian.\u00a0\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<strong>Palazzo Zuckerman.<\/strong> This houses both the Museum of Applied and Decorative Arts (furniture, coins, pottery, porcelain, jewellry, lace) and the Museo Bottacin, a wealthy Paduan and his summer home in Trieste (coins, furniture, art).<br \/>\n<strong>Eremitani Museum<\/strong>. In the former Augustinian Hermits monastery, it shows the archaeology of Padua, there are exhibits on Romans, Etruscans, Greeks, Egypt and a lot of 14th to 18th century art, almost all religious on the upper floor.<br \/>\n<strong>Scrovegni Chapel.\u00a0<\/strong>After the Botanical Garden, this is the highlight of Padua.<br \/>\nin 1301, the rich nobleman, Ernich Scorvengi, built a townhouse in the area of the Roman arena and a chapel. He commissioned the Tuscan master, Giotto to decorate the chapel with frescoes between 1303-05. He also had Giovanni Pisano make the sculptures on the altar. Today, the frescoes are entirely preserved showing the stories of the Virgin Mary and Jesus on the walls ending with the impressive fresco of the Last Judgement.<br \/>\nVisitors enter a special room 15 minutes before entering the chapel in order to stabilize the temperature and humidity in the chapel, which is visited for another 15 minutes.<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.visitabanomontegrotto.com\/en\/region\/places-of-faith\/scrovegni-chapel-padua\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwiJv_2i8IzhAhUCU1AKHd4jDwkQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/www.visitabanomontegrotto.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Cappella-degli-Scrovegni-a-Padova1-812x400.jpg\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"717\" height=\"353\" data-iml=\"1552952878976\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/11602696@N00\/8181887024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwjx7Mrq8IzhAhUDYVAKHcK9DmYQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/farm9.staticflickr.com\/8202\/8181887024_a57aef893e_b.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Scrovegni Chapel.\" width=\"577\" height=\"353\" data-iml=\"1552953029337\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wga.hu\/html_m\/g\/giotto\/padova\/4lastjud\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwjkp9TH8YzhAhXDbFAKHX72DB8QjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wga.hu\/art\/g\/giotto\/padova\/4lastjud\/11_lastj.jpg\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"515\" height=\"353\" data-iml=\"1552953224216\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"http:\/\/www.italia.it\/en\/travel-ideas\/culture-and-entertainment\/the-scrovegni-chapel-in-padua.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwiM6NHL8IzhAhWEIlAKHR_KD3sQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"http:\/\/www.italia.it\/fileadmin\/src\/img\/cluster_gallery\/Cultura\/cultura_spettacolo\/Giotto_Scrovegni\/Padova_Scrovegni_Giotto_adorazione_magi.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Scrovegni Chapel.\" width=\"471\" height=\"353\" data-iml=\"1552952964419\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Portogruaro.<\/strong> Another nondescript NM \u201csmall town, this is quite a big place with a long access off the main highway.
