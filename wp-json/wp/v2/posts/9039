First flown in August of 1940, the B-25 began operational service with the United States Army Air Force in 1941. The design was named in honour of Major General William &#8220;Billy&#8221; Mitchell, a pioneer of U.S. military aviation.\u00a0 The B-25 first gained fame as the bomber used in the April 18, 1942, Doolittle Raid, in which 16 B-25Bs led by Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle flying from the deck of the United States Navy aircraft carrier Hornet attacked mainland Japan.<\/em><br \/>\n<em>Nearly 10,000 Mitchells were manufactured. They were used by many Allied air forces including the\u00a0<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Americans, Brits, Aussies, and others during WWII.<\/span>\u00a0and served in every theatre of World War II. B-25s remained in service after the war, their use spanning four decades. <\/em><br \/>\n<em><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When the war was over, Canada bought 164 B-25 Mitchell bombers in the late 1940s for the Royal Canadian Air Force to use as training aircraft, light transport, and to fly special missions\u00a0<\/span><\/em><em><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">during the early parts of the Cold War.\u00a0<\/span><\/em><em><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Some of the planes remained bombers&#8211;this was the Cold War, after all.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/em><em><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It was on one of these special missions that the converted B-25 crashed\u00a0 The plane carried nine people: seven military personnel and two civilians (both &#8220;smuggled&#8221; aboard), a couple named Mr. and Mrs. F.M. Knight, who owned a hotel in Penticton. The plane was conducting an aerial survey and heading to Penticton to drop off the Knights. The weather was grim that day; it was the first snow of the season, the wind was howling, it was foggy, and visibility was very limited. The plane likely iced up and lost control because it lost a lot of elevation in a very short distance to end up on the floor of Plewman Basin.\u201d But once the plane hit the floor of the basin, no one survived.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The first ski lift was still a couple of months from being ready. It was the first snow of the year and the visibility in the fog was about zero.

R. Gibbard of this city on Tuesday afternoon, the mystery which has shrouded the disappearance of an RCAF plan for the past five years, has been cleared up and another page in RCAF records will now be completed.<br \/>\nMr. Gibbard, who regularly travels the wooded trails north of the city while in the course of his duties which entail packing supplies to Old Glory, was on a hunting expedition Tuesday. When about three miles off the route which he usually follows, he spotted what proved to be the wreckage of a plane.<br \/>\nHe immediately notified the RCMP and at 6 a.m. yesterday a search party left here to investigate the find. The party included Constable Rammage and the police dog Wolf of Nelson, Constable P. W. Howarth and Constable C.M. Brown of the Rossland RCMP detachment, W. R. Gibbard, who guided them to the scene, and Bob Porteous of the Trail Times staff&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Identify Craft<br \/>\nThe wreckage was reported by the RCMP to cover an area of approximately half a mile long and about 100 yards wide. Only small sections were found and all of it was badly smashed but the party was able to obtain some serial numbers and identification marks from which the RCAF at Vancouver has definitely established that the wreckage is that of \u201cthe B-25 Mitchell of Reconnaissance flight which was lost October 18th, 1947&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Nine Aboard<br \/>\nSeven RCAF crew members and two civilians, Mr. and Mrs. Harry Knight of Penticton, were aboard the plane when it disappeared, but no signs of any bodies were found by the search party. It was the opinion of the search party members that there was an explosion at the time of the crash and it was felt no one would have survived. A few personal effects including parts of parachute packs and flight boots were found &#8230;parts of the mangled plane were partially overgrown and a small swath, apparently cut by the plane, through timbers was nearly invisible.<br \/>\nThe scene of the crash was on a ridge extending from the first summit above Rossland to the Blueberry creek area and the altitude was about 5500 feet&#8230;<br \/>\nThe find appears to bear out a report made by residents in the Blueberry area at the time of the crash that a flash denoting an explosion had been seen. However an intensive search was conducted at the time with no results.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1582666927997_31906\" class=\"sqs-block spacer-block sqs-block-spacer sized vsize-1\" data-block-type=\"21\">\n<div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1582666927997_31969\" class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\">\n<div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1601348015576_770\" class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<h3><strong>THE LIST OF THOSE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES IN THE CRASH IS AS FOLLOWS:<br \/>\n<\/strong>THE CREW OF MITCHELL MK.
