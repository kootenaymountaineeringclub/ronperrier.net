It is part of hiking, and my spiritual side is found in nature. Spending time in the mountains of the Canadian Rockies, the interior of BC, and on Vancouver Island, where I now live, has been a passion since my university days.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I have made 38 trips to the desert Southwest of the USA, always hiking everywhere to explore what may be one of the most beautiful places in the world.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Walking and trekking have always been a large part of my travel. I&#8217;ve walked over 2000 km of the Camino de Santiago, once walking 1750 km in a continuous walk over 64 days from Le Puy en Valey, France to Santiago.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I have Asperger&#8217;s syndrome, and all the great thinkers mentioned in this book also had Asperger&#8217;s syndrome. There must be a connection.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I added articles about the human foot. Again, there is so much here that resonated with me. Since starting travel in 2006, I have worn flip-flops almost 99% of the time (I only wear shoes when doing rough hiking), and often walk over 20 km per day. That is the way I have explored most of the cities I&#8217;ve visited. This is only possible with special flip-flops, and I exclusively wear Chacos. I can&#8217;t help but think that they have made my feet very strong like the Tarahumara of the Copper Canyon of northern Mexico. Read the excellent book on running, &#8220;Born to Run,<em>&#8220;<\/em> to see another discussion of the evils of modern footwear, clearly a conspiracy by running shoe manufacturers to sell shoes that may do more harm than good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;

In this way, the activity plays a crucial role in avoiding chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The weight-bearing nature of hiking can also help increase bone density, which reduces the risk of osteoporosis, adds Hashish.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Muscle growth and maintenance occurs as well since hiking targets multiple muscle groups, including the quadriceps, hamstrings, hip flexors, shins, calves, glutes, and core, Using trekking poles can similarly engage upper-body muscles like arms and shoulders, and steeper hikes can intensify the workout for many muscles. Some individuals will also choose to hike with additional loads such as a ruck sack or weight vest for an additional stimulus.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Frequent changes in terrain and navigating around rocks and other obstacles also means one is improving balance, posture and coordination.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Hiking is really a three-in-one exercise that combines components of cardio, balance, and weightlifting\u2014and this increased complexity creates a greater challenge for our bodies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Improved mental acuity<\/strong><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The mental health benefits of hiking are no less compelling.

Neuroplasticity is vital to us as humans because it enables us to learn and evolve through life and it powers the thinking and memory centers in the brain.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Hiking with others has also\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">been shown to be good<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> for one&#8217;s social life, which can reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Benefits unique to nature<\/strong><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">But many of the best\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">mental health benefits<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> associated with hiking stem from the rhythmic cadence of walking combined with the calming effects of the sights, sounds, and smells of nature.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Simply inhaling an organic compound called phytoncides that trees release\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">has been found to<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> improve immunity.

Today, shoes allow one to play blacktop basketball and hike in the woods after a nor\u2019easter. High ankle boots protect against snakebites in the grasslands of Australia and sub-Saharan Africa. Footwear protects against broken glass at the beach or along city sidewalks. Or it simply allows one to buy something at the store since \u201cno shirt, no shoes, no service.\u201d Without shoes, humans wouldn\u2019t have summited Mt. Everest or walked on the moon. There were and remain an important technological innovation. But as is true for many of our cleaver inventions, there are costs that accompany these benefits.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The bottom of your foot contains ten muscles, arranged in four layers. Some of these muscles maintain the foot\u2019s arch while others are critical for propelling us into our next steps. But most shoes, even the wholesome-sounding \u201carch-supporting\u201d ones can weaken these muscles. The result is a foot more prone to injury.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Tarahumara are an indigenous people in Mexico known for their exceptional distance-running abilities. Their sandals are usually made from a piece of car tire rubber and held to the foot with string. Human evolutionists studying the Tarahumara to see how they walk and run also used ultrasound to measure the size of their foot muscles. The Tarahumara have higher arches, stiffer feet, and larger foot muscles than the typical American.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Maybe the Tarahumara are just genetically predisposed to have strong foot muscles? The size of two-foot muscles was measured in 33 runners. Half of the runners trained in their normal, cushioned running shoes. The other half transitioned slowly to a minimalist shoe \u2013 more like the Tarahumara wear. After only 12 weeks, the minimalist shoe-wearers had increased the size of the two-foot muscles by 20% and their arch was stiffer by a whopping 60%. Our feet change because of the shoes we wear, or don\u2019t wear.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Not only that, but without strong foot muscles, the plantar aponeurosis \u2013 that band of tissue that spans the bottom of the foot \u2013 can become over-strained, resulting in the stabbing pain of plantar fasciitis. We have lulled ourselves into thinking that our feet need cushioning to survive.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">To boot, shoes no longer just protect the feet. They are gendered symbols of social status, wealth, and power. Our feet pay the price. High-heeled shoes shorten the calf muscles and tighten the Achilles tendon, changing how we walk. Repeatedly squeezing the end of our feet into the narrow, pointed shoe box of a shoe increases the chances of developing bunions and hammertoes. These damaging effects disproportionately impact women\u2019s feet and sometimes require surgical intervention.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"natgeo\">\n<div id=\"fitt-analytics\">\n<div class=\"bp-mobileMDPlus bp-mobileLGPlus bp-tabletPlus bp-desktopPlus bp-desktopLGPlus bp-desktopXLGPlus no-touch\" data-fitt-page-type=\"prismarticle\">\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<div class=\"PageLayout page-container cf PageLayout--desktopLg PageLayout--prismarticle fitt-fade-in\">\n<div class=\"PageLayout__Main\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"main\">\n<div class=\"\">\n<div id=\"natgeo-template1-frame-1-module-1\" class=\"StackModule\">\n<div class=\"ScrollSpy_container\">\n<p><strong style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">WALKING BAREFOOT<br \/>\n<\/strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;

We have 33 joints in our feet, and [our feet] move on three different planes. So they\u2019re meant to mould to the terrain we walk on. But modern footwear has restricted our natural movement patterns, affecting our gait and even the structure of our feet.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Most modern shoes have a tapered toe box, which means our toes are scrunched together and you can\u2019t really press down or engage your toes, therefore also engage your intrinsic foot muscles. Additionally, cushioned midsoles reduce sensory input, making it harder to feel the ground beneath us. This may contribute to poor posture, reduced balance over time, and even arch collapse, leading to musculoskeletal issues.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">While modern shoes have thick foam cushioning, narrow toe boxes, and a raised heel, barefoot-style shoes have flexible, thin outsoles, a wide toe box to encourage your toes to splay, and a zero-drop design that places your heel on the same level as your toes, just like you\u2019re barefoot.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"FITT_Article_main_group_wrapper VZTD UeCOM jIRH oimqG DjbQm UwdmX Xmrlz ReShI KaJdY lqtkC ssImf HfYhe RTHNs iJVrZ \" data-testid=\"prism-GridContainer\">\n<div class=\"Kiog kNVGM nvpSA qwdi bmjsw \" data-testid=\"prism-GridRow\">\n<div class=\"theme-e oBTii mrzah \" data-testid=\"prism-GridColumn\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Transitioning to a Barefoot Lifestyle.<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">While the research about the barefoot movement is promising, don\u2019t throw out all of your shoes just yet. Switching too quickly can be a recipe for injury. <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Our feet have adapted to cushioned shoes, losing some of their innate strength. Plus, many of us are now hypersensitive to anything but smooth, soft ground (think about walking on gravel), so walking barefoot everywhere could be a painful endeavour.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">You can\u2019t just shed your shoes and break out into a jog: That\u2019s like having your arm in a sling or in a cast for years on end. Then take your cast off, and the first thing you do is go out and play a game of tennis. Of course, you\u2019re going to hurt your arm if you do that. Transitioning too quickly can overload underused muscles and tendons, causing stress fractures, plantar fasciitis, and Achilles tendonitis. Recommend starting slow.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">First, try walking around the house and outside on a soft surface. Then, go for a short walk around the block. Increase the mileage slowly, adding a bit more each week. \u201cYour feet will tell you when you\u2019ve had enough and if you experience any sharp pain, stop.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Proper footwear can help you with the shift, but when you first wear them, they\u2019ll feel different from any shoes you\u2019ve tried. \u201cThey\u2019re going to feel too big for you because you have so much space in the toe box,\u201d says Harris. With more use, they\u2019ll start to feel more natural. The sensation of the ground beneath you may feel strange, so your feet may fatigue more quickly.

Granted, he spent almost five years traveling around the world on the Beagle recording observations that produced some of the most important scientific insights ever made. But he was in his twenties then, embarking on a privileged, 19<sup>th<\/sup>&#8211; century naturalist\u2019s version of backpacking around Europe during a gap year. After returning home in 1836, he never again stepped outside the British Isles.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">He avoided conferences, parties, and large gatherings. They made him anxious and exacerbated an illness that plagued much of his adult life. Instead, he passed his days at Down House, his quiet home almost 20-miles southeast of London, doing most of his writing in the study. He occasionally entertained a visitor or two but preferred to correspond with the world by letter. He installed a mirror in his study so he could glance up from his work to see the mailman coming up the road \u2013 the 19<sup>th<\/sup>-century version of hitting the Refresh button on email.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Darwin\u2019s best thinking, however, was not done in his study. It was done outside, on a lowercase d-shaped path on the edge of his property that he called the Sandwalk. Today, it is known as Darwin\u2019s thinking path.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As a businessman, he would pile up a mound of flints at the turn of the path and knock one away every time he passed to ensure he made a predetermined number of circuits without having to interrupt his train of thought. Five turns around the path amounted to half a mile or so. The Sandwalk was where he pondered. In this soothing routine, a sense of place became preeminent in Darwin\u2019s science. It shaped his identity as a thinker.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Darwin circled the Sandwalk as he developed his theory of evolution, by means of natural selection. He walked to ponder the mechanism of movement in climbing plants and to imagine what wonders pollinated the fantastically shaped colorful orchids he described. He walked as he accumulated evidence for human ancestry. His final walks were done with his wife Emma as he thought about earth worms and their role in gradually remodeling the soil.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Today, the desk in his study is still cluttered with books, letters, and small specimen boxes containing pinned insects. Hanging from a nearby chair is his black jacket, black bowler hat, and a wooden walking stick, the bottom of which is well worn \u2013 evidence of the miles on the Sandwalk. Walk out the back kitchen of the cream-coloured home, pass the green trellis and vine-covered columns holding up Darwin\u2019s back porch, dross the beautifully groomed garden, and enter the Sandwalk. It is easy to imagine that it was 1871 and that you are taking a walk with Darwin himself. Stack 5 flat flints at the entrance for 5 laps and begin the walk, first along the meadow and then counterclockwise into the woods. The Sandwalk is alive. Underfoot, fungi decompose wet leaves, emitting the smell of wet earth. With each step, the gravel crunched, and your shoes occasionally slip on damp stones worn smooth by thousands of footsteps, including some taken by Darwin himself.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Down House is not a place of magic, nor is it a place of worship. Looping the Sandwalk one flint at a time doesn\u2019t endow you with the wisdom to continue your scientific pursuits. It turns out, any walk outdoors has the potential to unlock our brains. The Sandwalk just happened to be where the unlocking of one 19<sup>th<\/sup>-century brain helped change the world and our place in it. But why? Why does walking help us think?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Walking and thinking<\/strong>. You are undoubtedly familiar with this situation: You\u2019re struggling with a problem \u2013 a tough work or school assignment, a complicated relationship, the prospects of a career change \u2013 and you cannot figure out what to do. So, you decide to take a walk, and somewhere along that trek, the answer comes to you.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The 19<sup>th<\/sup>-century English poet William Wordsworth is said to have walked 180,000 miles in his life. Surely on one of those walks, he discovered his dancing daffodils. French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau once said, \u201cThere is something about walking which stimulates and enlivens my thoughts. When I stay in one place I can hardly think at all; my body has to be on the move to set my mind going.\u201d Ralph Waldo Emerson\u2019s and Henry David Thoreau\u2019s walks in the New England woods inspired their writing, including \u201cWalking,\u201d Thoreau\u2019s treatise on the subject. John Muir, Jonathan Swift, Immanuel Kant, Beethoven, Henry Cavendish, and Frederick Nietzsche were obsessive walkers. Nietzsche, who walked with his notebook every day between 11 am and 1 pm, said, \u201cAll truly great thoughts are conceived by walking.\u201d Charles Dickens preferred to take long walks through London at night. \u201cThe road was so lonely in the night, that I fell asleep to the monotonous sound of my own feet, doing their regular four miles an hour,\u201d Dickens wrote, \u201cMile after mile I walked, without the slightest sense of exertion, dozing heavily and dreaming constantly.\u201d More recently, walks became an important part of the creative process of Apple cofounder Steve Jobs.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It is important to pause and reflect on these famous walkers. They were all guys and virtually all had Asperger\u2019s syndrome. Little has been written about famous women who regularly walked. Virginia Woolf is one exception. She apparently walked quite a bit. More recently, Rob Davidson trekked with her dog and four camels across Australia and wrote about it in her book Tracks. In 1999, Dorris Haddock, an 89-year-old grandmother from Dublin, New Hampshire, walked 3,200 miles from coast to coast to protest United States campaign finance laws.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Historically, however, walking has been the privilege of white men. Black men were likely to be arrested, or worse. Women just out for a walk were harassed, or worse. And, of course, rarely in our evolutionary history was it safe for anyone to walk alone.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Perhaps it is a coincidence that so many great thinkers were obsessive walkers. There could be many brilliant thinkers who never walked. Did Willian Shakespeare, Jane Austen, or Toni Morrison walk every day? What about Frederick Douglass, Marie Curie, or Isaac Newton? Surely the astoundingly brilliant Stephen Hawking did not walk after ALS paralyzed him. So walking is not essential to thinking, but it certainly helps.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Marily Oppezzo, a Stanford University psychologist, used to walk around campus with her Ph.D. advisor to discuss lab results and brainstorm new projects. One day they came up with an experiment to look at the effects of walking on creative thinking. Was there something to the age-old idea that walking and thinking are linked?<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Oppezzo designed an elegant experiment. A group of Stanford students was asked to list as many creative uses for common objects as they could. A Frisbee, for example, can be used as a dog toy, but it can also be used as a hat, a plate, a bird bath, or a small shovel. The more novel uses a student listed, the higher the creativity score. Half the students sat for an hour before they were given their test. The others walked on a treadmill. The results were staggering. Creativity scores improved by 60% after a walk.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Another study of brain connectivity recruited 65 couch-potato volunteers aged 55 \u2013 80 and imaged their brains in an MRI machine. For the next year, half of her volunteers took 45-minute walks three times a week. The other participants kept spending their days watching Golden Girls reruns and only participated in stretching exercises as a control. After a year, they were put back in the MRI machine and imaged their brains again. Not much had happened to the control group, but the walkers had significantly improved connectivity in regions of the brain understood to play an important role in our ability to think creatively.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Walking changes our brains, and it impacts not only creativity but also memory.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A study involving 18,766 women aged 70 to 81 showed that even walking as little as 90 minutes per week reduced the rate at which cognition declined over time. As cognitive decline is what occurs in the earliest stages of dementia, walking might ward off that neurodegenerative condition. But correlation does not equal causation. Maybe mentally active people were simply more likely to go for a walk?<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">One source of information comes from medical students dissecting cadavers in first-year anatomy. Paleontologists need to know anatomy. A fossil could be from any one of more than 200 different bones in the body and from one of dozens of different animals often found along with human fossils. The brain is accessed by sawing off the top of the head. Students are awed when they hold the brain. The brain is the person. The brain is cut into left and right halves. Sitting on top of the brain stem is a thick loop of tissue about the length of a pinky finger. It is called the <strong>hippocampus<\/strong> and is the memory center of the brain. Old memories are often retained, but new ones aren\u2019t. This puzzles and frustrates them and they get angry. This should make us want to do everything we can to maintain this region of our brain. Other kinds of memories are stored elsewhere \u2013 the ability to recognize faces, so-called implicit memories like how to ride a bike, and so-called explicit memories such as the date WWII began. But the hippocampus is the depository of our life stories.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As we get old, our brain gets smaller and in later years, the hippocampus shrinks at a clip of 1 to 2% per year, and it becomes more and more difficult to recall things that used to come to us instantly. What are we to do about this? Walk.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A study of 120 aging but otherwise healthy people had MRIs that measured the size of their hippocampus. Half were asked to walk forty minutes three times a week. The other half just did stretches but did not take the long walks. After a year, the stretching group had lost between 1 and 2% of the volume of the hippocampus. That was expected. But something extraordinary happened with the walkers. They gained some. The walking group, on average, had grown the hippocampus by 2%. Accordingly, their memory had improved.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The hippocampus, it turns out, can regenerate, and even with just a daily walk can promote growth. Walking can not only delay some effects of aging but can reverse them. But how?<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">One explanation is that walking, or any exercise, helps get the blood flowing, and, indeed this happens.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">MRI brain scans of people who walked for 10 minutes every half hour or so and others who sat all day showed that those who walked had significantly greater blood flow in the middle cerebral and carotid arteries. But blood flow is just the vehicle. It must be carrying something of critical importance to the brain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>WOMEN &amp; WALKING<br \/>\n<\/strong>Wide hips are not a detriment to a woman\u2019s gait. They are adaptive. They also affect how many women walk. Having wider hips causes more rotation, or swivel, when walking. This allows women, who typically have shorter legs than men, to take longer strides than one might expect. Wider hips don\u2019t make a woman\u2019s walk less efficient. They just make it mechanically different.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Especially in endurance athletics, the gap between men and women is closing. Some studies show that women\u2019s leg muscles tend to be more resistant to fatigue than men\u2019s. In sports that test endurance rather than strength and speed, women may have an advantage.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The wrongheaded notion that female walking is compromised remains pervasive. It has been called the hangover from <em>Genesis<\/em>. Walking is related to both thinking and freedom and that historically men have thought women \u201cdeserve less of each.\u201d In a culture that has been heavily influenced by interpretations of the book of <em>Genesis<\/em>, the obstetrical dilemma may be a flawed hypothesis, but difficult labour, dangerous childbirth, and helpless babies are not Eve\u2019s fault, but evolutions. What happens to a woman\u2019s gait and posture during pregnancy? As gestation reaches the third trimester, a sizable amount of baby, placenta and amniotic fluid accumulates in the front of the body, pulling the center of mass forward, Quadrupedal animals don\u2019t have the same problem since weight gain during pregnancy wouldn\u2019t alter the center of mass. Why don\u2019t women tip over? The answer lies in the small of the lower back. Men and women both have five lumbar vertebrae. In men, the bottom two are shaped like wedges, producing a curve in the spine that brings the torso over the hips. But, in women, the bottom three vertebrae are wedge-shaped, giving them a larger curve. This helps women bring the shifting center of mass back over the hip joints, keeping them balanced as they walk. This sex difference in the shape of the third-to-last lumbar vertebrae occurred early in our evolutionary past. Australopithecus had it over two million years ago.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><br \/>\nWomen and Pregnancy<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It has been shown that women walk as efficiently as men. But in some circumstances, they are even better at it. We don\u2019t walk only in straight lines or on flat surfaces, and neither did our early ancestors. We don\u2019t always walk empty-handed, either, and neither did they. With hands freed by bipedal walking, they carried food, water, tools, and babies. Walking while carrying an object roughly the same size as a human infant, can increase the amount of energy expended by nearly 20%. But the energy required is significantly reduced in individuals with wide hips from side to side \u2013 the kind often found in women. Women are, by all measures, better carriers than men. Wide hips are not about childbearing, they are about child carrying.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When waking, humans can settle at their most efficient pace and walk great distances without using too much energy. But walking with a group, especially one that includes children, often means slowing down, stopping, and speeding back up. When men vary speeds, they use more energy. Wider hips make it easier for women.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Women use their hips as a shelf, perching babies there they walk around the house. When men try it, the babies slide down their thighs. With no bony shelf, men\u2019s arms tire. Carrying squirming kids is not easy, never mind if you are walking six miles a day as modern hunters and gatherers do.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>GAIT DIFFERENCES and WHAT THEY MEAN<br \/>\n<\/strong>The way each of us walks is unique and recognizable, whether it\u2019s John Wayne\u2019s slightly off-balance swagger, Dorothy\u2019s skip toward Oz, Mae West\u2019s exaggerated hip swivel, or the lope of Shaggy from <em>Scooby-Doo<\/em>. This observation is more than anecdotal.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">One of the first experiments to test whether people could identify one another by the way they walk, recorded individuals walking and then converted their bodies into a series of small lights, similar to the motion-capture technology used in Hollywood and video games today. That way, study participants could not pick up on cues such as hair colour or body shape. Even when people were turned into a string of lights, their friends were pretty good at spotting them.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Repeated studies have confirmed that we are skilled at recognizing friends and family members solely by the way they walk. As it turns out, regions of our brains are fine-tuned to accomplish this.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A 2017 study had 19 participants lie in an MRI and watch videos of familiar people coming toward them. A region of the brain just behind their ears (the bilateral posterior superior temporal sulcus) activated when they recognized people from their walks. When the walkers were close enough for their faces to be identified, a different area of the participants\u2019 brains lit up.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But the way a person walks signals more than their identity. We are skilled at detecting moods, intentions, and even personality traits from the way someone walks. Slumped shoulders and a plodding gait are recognized as signs of sadness. A bounce in one\u2019s step communicates happiness. A loud stomp can signify anger. Research shows that these influences are not just a matter of intuition.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">However, people aren\u2019t always 100% accurate in interpreting these cues, and some of us are better at it than others. We perceive others as adventurous, warm, trustworthy, neurotic, extroverted, or approachable by the way they walk, but the walkers often don\u2019t think of themselves that way at all. It appears that the inferences we draw this way are sometimes wrong.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But, as it turns out, some of those who are particularly good at it are psychopaths. When videos of undergraduates walking were shown to 47 maximum-security prisoners, they were asked how vulnerable the walkers were on a scale of one to ten. The prisoners, especially those characterized as psychopaths, revealed in follow-up questioning that they used gait cues to identify those who were frail or otherwise vulnerable to being preyed upon. Given the same task, undergraduate students were blind to these cues.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The implications were chilling. Ted Bundy, who confessed to raping and killing thirty women and girls in the 1970s, once boasted that he could \u201ctell a victim by the way she walked down the street, the tilt of her head, how she carried herself.\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It makes evolutionary sense that all animals \u2013 including humans \u2013 would be fine-tuned to identify different species and different individuals within those species, and even to recognize their moods by the way they move.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Given the evidence that different hominin species walked differently from one another in the past, it would have been beneficial, and perhaps even a matter of life and death, to know whether a group of hominins foraging in the distance belonged to your species or another. Subtle gait cues might have helped with these identifications.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As it happens, our gaits aren\u2019t the only things about walking that betray our identities. Footprints are like fingerprints. Omar Costilla-Reyes developed an algorithm that identifies individuals by the footprints they leave behind. He identified 24 ways in which footprints differ from one person to another, and it is accurate 99.3% of the time. In the last two decades, the research community has, by and large, moved to facial recognition, deemed a superior approach. The wrong camera angle, variations in the walking surface, or carrying a load are enough to alter gait and impact accuracy. Individual gait signatures would be challenging to extract from a crowd. Facial recognition is cheaper and more effective.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Gait analysis has possibilities for health professionals. One of the first symptoms to appear in dementia is a change in gait.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In 2012, an app was developed that allows a smartphone to recognize the gait of its owner. Tiny gyroscopes and accelerometers inside smartphones can detect subtle differences in how someone walks. Since everyone has a unique gait, the phone will remain locked if it doesn\u2019t recognize the user&#8217;s speed and movement.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Walking has always been about more than moving from one place to another. It is, and always has been, a social phenomenon. Today, we celebrate the solitary, cerebral Thoreau, Wordsworth, and Darwin, but rarely in our evolutionary history has walking alone been a. \u00a0good idea. Until very recently, a lone, contemplative walk would have surely ended in the piercing grip of a leopard\u2019s jaw.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Often, we walk collectively, like a school of fish, and it seems likely that our ancestors did too. It has long been known that people walking together subconsciously coordinate their gaits. One study had 14 middle school girls walk down a school hallway. When walking in pairs, the girls synchronized their gaits. Wearing blinders that blocked their views of one another did not change the results. Synchronization was easiest when the girls held hands. People walking on adjacent treadmills at the gym synchronize their gaits. All people, no matter where they are from, even strangers, synchronize their strides. Sometimes, however, synchronized walking comes at a cost.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">At just 18 years of age, Stephen King wrote his first book, <em>The Long Walk<\/em>. In it, one hundred teenage boys and young men line up at the Maine-Canada border and walk south at four miles per hour. If they go under this speed threshold, they are issued a warning. Three warnings, and they are executed by soldiers riding alongside them. Crowds lined the streets, cheering them on. The long walk ends when there is only one competitor left standing.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">What makes <em>The Long Walk<\/em> so gripping is the speed threshold: 4 miles per hour. A cross-cultural study on over 2,000 people from thirty-one different countries found that human walking alone on flat city streets averages almost exactly 3 miles per hour. The Irish and the Dutch tend to be slightly faster (3.6 miles per hour) and Brazilians and Romanians stroll at a more casual pace (2.5 miles per hour).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When walking speeds of 338 people of different ages were studied, an average of 2.8 miles per hour showed gradual slowing with age. At this speed, humans can walk and walk and walk without exhaustion.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But the cost to move our bodies increases with speed. Those boys in King\u2019s novel were exhausted, mentally, emotionally and yes, physically. Having to sustain four miles per hour to stay alive is what makes <em>The Long Walk<\/em> horrifying.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There are many reasons, some cultural and some anatomical, for why people naturally walk at different speeds, but one of them involves basic principles of energetics. Try walking at your normal pace. Now accelerate and walk faster. It takes energy to do this. But if you slow to a snail\u2019s pace, it also takes energy to resist your body\u2019s preferred speed. Everyone has an optimal walking speed, so what happens when people with different optimal speeds walk together?<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Picture two walkers, a fast one and a slow one. Does the slow one speed up and absorb all of the energetic costs, or does the fast one slow down and take on that burden? What happens in a large group of people who all have different optimal walking speeds? The answer appears to be that people tend to meet in the middle subconsciously settling into an optimal speed that minimizes energy costs for the entire group.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">However, a twist occurs when two walkers are romantically involved. The male in a heterosexual relationship absorbs the entire cost. This may be chivalrous but not entirely fair from a physiologic point of view. Women\u2019s wide hips also give a wider range of optimal walking speeds than men have. When women slow down or speed up, they don\u2019t expend as much energy as men do.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Nevertheless, walking has always been something we do together. For 97% of our species\u2019 history, and for 99% of the time that bipedal hominins have walked the Earth, we have been nomadic hunters and gatherers. We roamed the landscape, walking from one food source to the next. We established temporary camps, and when the resources were nearly exhausted, we packed up our few belongings and moved on together.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Some human populations, including the Hadza of Tanzania and the Tsimane of Bolivia, still live this way, but today most people live in permanent settlements and eat farm products. We drive cars and fly in airplanes. And many of our cities, where more than half of all humans live, are designed in a way that makes walking from place to place difficult or even dangerous. Walking \u2013 the thing that made us human \u2013 isn\u2019t nearly as common as it used to be. There was a time when everybody walked; they did it because they had no choice. The moment they had a choice, they chose not to do it. As a result, our health has suffered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>MYOKINES<\/strong>. Those molecules released by contracting muscles target the brain, and blood flow delivers them. One of those myokines is called irisin, named after Iris, the Greek goddess of rainbows and Hera\u2019s personal messenger. Alarmingly low levels of irisin have been found in humans with Alzheimer\u2019s, a disease that impacts one in ten people over 65.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When the production of irisin is blocked in mice, they performed terribly trying to remember where the cheese was in a maze. When the irisin flowed again, the same mice recovered. The mice that performed the best were the ones that exercised. In mice, at least, irisin goes straight to the hippocampus where it protects neurons from degeneration.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Another myokine is called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). It may be even more important than irisin. The walkers whose hippocampus increased by 2% also had higher levels of BDNF than the non-walking group. BDNF has been called \u201cMiracle-Gro for your brain.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Depression.<\/strong> There is some evidence that walking helps relieve symptoms of depression and anxiety. They may believe they weren\u2019t walking because they were depressed and enervated, but perhaps they are depressed because they weren\u2019t walking. Those who struggle with depression describe it as an exhausting abyss of hopelessness. When you are in it, you feel like you\u2019ll never get out. One in twelve Americans knows this feeling. While many studies have shown that a regular walk can alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety, it doesn\u2019t work for everybody. Furthermore, the benefits appear to depend on where you walk.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When you examine the brain, the folds and fissures of the brain seem randomly distributed. To a neurologist, they are a map that reveals the workings of our most magnificent organ. The folds in the back of the brain are where visual cues are processed. A strip of nervous tissue across the top helps coordinate movement. The bulge in the front of the brain is where we make plans. 52 different regions of the brain were identified and named in the early 20<sup>th<\/sup>-century by German neurologist Kobinian Brodmann, and each one now bears his name. Brodmann area 22 processes sound. Brodmann 44 and 45 help you talk.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">About three inches behind the bridge of your nose is Brodmann 25, or what modern neurologists call the subgenual prefrontal cortex (sgPFC). It plays an important role in regulating our moods, displaying increased activity during periods of sadness and rumination.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">One study had 38 people fill out a survey that included questions about their mood and negative self-reflection. The survey was tallied into what was called a rumination score. MRI scans of the sgPFC accessed the blood flow to this region. Then they were sent out for a walk. Half took a 3 \u00bd mile walk through greenspace on a university. There was fresh air, the shade of coast live oak trees, and screeches from western scrub jays. The other half walked the same distance on a sidewalk along a busy, multilane street through the heart of the city. There, they had to be alert for cars coming and going from gas stations, hotels, parking lots, and fast-food restaurants. When the participants returned, they had another survey and another MRI scan.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Those that had walked along the busy road showed no change in their rumination scores or in the blood flow to the sgPFC. But those that had walked through the woods had lowered their rumination scores, and blood flow to the sgPFC had reduced significantly.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">For our mental health, it seems, we should walk where there are trees, birds, and the soft whispers of the wind.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When treadmill walkers did better than non-walkers on creativity tests, a test group took its walk outside. The ones on footpaths performed even better than the treadmill walkers at coming up with original ideas.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Unfortunately, we are not only walking less but, with so many of us living in urban areas, we are doing it in places that erase some of the health benefits.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Perhaps Ray Bradbury was right about what the future may hold. In his 1951 short story \u201cThe Pedestrian,\u201d set a hundred years in the future, a writer named Leonard Mead goes for his nightly walk.

In terms of evolution, walking is our default. Throughout Our History, if we wanted to eat, we had to walk. What\u2019s new is not walking.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Consider the effect that immobility has had on our bones. Our skeleton consists of two different kinds of bone. One, called cortical or compact, is the thick outer shell of our bones. The other, called trabecular, located in the joints where our bones meet, is a network of thinner, spongy bone arranged like a honeycomb. Compared to our ape cousins, humans have less of both kinds. We rely more on our trabecular skeleton to absorb, like a sponge, the high impact forces of bipedalism. Why, then, would we have so little of it?<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">CT scans can be used to calculate trabecular bone density in the skeletons of humans, apes and fossil hominins. Chimpanzees, fossil Australopithecus, Neanderthals, and even Pleistocene Homo sapiens had the same density of trabecular bone in their joints: 30 to 40%. But humans today have less \u2013 20 to 30%. This drop in bone density appeared to occur suddenly in the last 10,000 years. It has been suggested this happened because we don\u2019t move around as much as our ancestors did.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Another study of four human populations \u2013 two nomadic groups and two farming communities \u2013 found that nomadic people have denser bones than farmers. While diet might have something to do with this, most scientists agree that bones are less dense in people that don\u2019t move around as much. In fact, humans have lost as much bone density in the last 10,000 years as an astronaut loses in a trip through the low gravity conditions of space.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As we age, our bones naturally thin as levels of bone-stimulating estrogens fall, especially in postmenopausal women. But because we already have such low-density bone, this further reduction can lead to osteoporosis and broken bones in our aging population. But osteoporosis might be the least of our worries.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">After age forty, what can we do to live longer and healthier? The answer could be as simple as a daily walk. A decade\u2019s worth of data on 650,000 people found that those who did the exercise equivalent of a 25-minute daily walk \u2013 as long as they were not obese \u2013 lived close to four years longer than their more immobile counterparts. Even a 10-minute daily walk could make a two-year difference in life span.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In a study of 300,000 Europeans, inactivity caused twice as many deaths as obesity. A 20-minute walk daily cut the risk of dying by one-third. It is better to fit and fat than lean and lazy. To understand, one has to dive deeper into the science of physiology.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Walking affects the complex dance of molecules in our bodies in significant ways. A lot of the research has been done in breast cancer, especially estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer, which occurs in two-thirds of all cases. Breast cancer is exceedingly complex.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Estrogen circulating in the bloodstream causes the cells of the breast tissue to grow and divide as part of the normal physiology of a woman. Every time a cell divides, it copies its DNA, and every time it does so, there is a chance of a mistake \u2013 a mutation. Usually, that is no big deal, but if a mutation occurs in a gene that limits how fast cells grow and divide, uncontrollable growth can produce a cluster of cells called a tumor. A mutation in a gene that keeps those cells in the breast where they belong could cause some to stray into the bloodstream and settle in the lungs, liver, bone, or brain. This process is called metastasis, and the result is stage IV breast cancer.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">One in eight American women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetimes. Nearly 3,000 men are diagnosed annually as well. It kills 40,000 Americans and over half a million people globally every year.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But a daily walk reduces the chances of developing breast cancer. How? One possible explanation is that exercise lowers the levels of estrogen circulating in the blood. Exercise increases the body\u2019s production of a molecule called sex hormone binding globulin. This molecule attaches itself to estrogen, reducing its concentration in the blood by 10 to 15%, thereby reducing the chance of a mutation in the DNA of breast cancer.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Even if a mutation occurs, exercise appears to help the damaged DNA repair itself. Exercising at least 20 minutes a day had a slight (1.6%) better ability to repair DNA copying mistakes, although it\u2019s unclear how this works.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">If the copying mistakes don\u2019t get fixed and cancer results, walking still helps. Exercise \u2013 even just an hour of walking a week \u2013 decreased the chances of dying by about 40%. A Saudi Arabia study put the number at 50% for estrogen-positive breast cancer. Exercise reduced the chance of cancer recurring after remission by 24%. Similar reductions in recurrence have been found in men with prostrate cancer who routinely walk after diagnosis. A 2016 study of 1.5 million people found that moderate exercise lowers the risk of developing thirteen different cancers.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">While cancer claims too many lives, the number one killer in industrialized nations is cardiovascular disease. In its various forms, it is responsible for one in four deaths, or 60,000 Americans a year. Walking can help stave that off, too. Frequent walkers have lower heart rates and lower blood pressure than sedentary individuals. A study of 40,000 American men found that a daily 30 minute walk lowered the risk for coronary heart disease by 18%.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Coronary heart disease is all but unheard of among hunter-gatherers. The Hadza of northern Tanzania are fourteen times more active than the average American. They also have lower blood pressure as they age, lower cholesterol, and not a hint of cardiovascular disease. Bolivia\u2019s Tsimane people similarly have low levels of coronary heart disease and five times less blockage of their arteries than the average person in the industrialized world.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Diet has a lot to do with this, but there is evidence that physical activity plays a critical role. Perhaps, though, not in the way you think.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Everyone figured that the Hadza used more energy than the typical American as the adults walk between 6-9 miles a day while the average American spends six hours a day staring at screens. What was found was shocking and forces us to think about our bodies in a different way. The total daily energy used by active Hadza and couch-potato Americans is the same. How is this possible? A clue is hidden in the one thing that walking does not help use do: lose weight. Humans are so efficient at walking that a 150-pound person would have to walk at least 70 miles to lose a pound. So the extra steps the Hazda take compared to the typical Americans don\u2019t burn much energy. But the Hazdas don\u2019t just walk. They dig, climb, and run. Surely, they should be using more energy.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The currently accepted hypothesis for this mystery is that human bodies all over the world have the same daily energy allowance. How they spend that energy varies from culture to culture and from person to person. The Hazda use energy getting from one place to another, gathering food, fighting off illness, carrying children and growing new ones. Americans do many of the same things, but because we aren\u2019t as active, our bodies spend the excess energy on something else, ramping up our body\u2019s inflammation response. Here\u2019s why that. Is a health problem.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The inflammation response refers to the way our bodies recruit large, vigilant, amoeba-looking cells called macrophages to ward off infections or repair injuries. These cells, whose name means \u201cbig eaters,\u201d are key components of our immune system. They make an infection-fighting protein called tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Among a variety of roles in the body, TNF tells the hypothalamus to crank up the body temperature when we are overrun by a virus or bacteria \u2013 a fever.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But chronically high levels of TNF have been linked to heart disease. Walking can downshift the production of TNF by 5% after a brisk 20-minute walk. How? The answer appears to involve a whole class of proteins that weren\u2019t even in textbooks a few years ago.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Interleukin-6 is a protein white blood cells use to communicate with one another. Interleukin-6 levels in marathon runners are a hundred times higher at the end of a race than at the start. Muscles make interleukin-6 and release it into the bloodstream. Many organs in our bodies make molecules and release them into our bloodstreams as a way to talk with other organs. These endocrine organs include the pancreas, the pituitary gland, the ovaries, and the testes. But few had thought of muscle as an endocrine organ. Over a hundred molecules that our muscles make are released into the blood as we walk. One of these, oncostatin M, shrinks breast tissue tumors in mice and could be yet another reason why exercise is beneficial to humans with breast cancer. This amazing family of molecules is called myokines.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As a myokine, interleukin-6 is an anti-inflammatory. Among other roles, it helps shut down the problematic tumor necrosis factor. It is the body\u2019s natural ibuprofen. Interleukin-6 can mobilize cells called \u201cnatural killers\u201d to attack and destroy cancerous tumors, at least in mice. For some reason, this myokine needs to be produced by muscles during exercise in order to work. But that does not require walking. Can the 3 million Americans in wheelchairs generate myokines? After wheelchair half-marathons and basketball games, interleukin-6 is elevated and TNF lowered.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Myokines, however, are not magic potions. They cannot be injected or swallowed. They are made only when the body is in motion, and in modern societies, if often is not. On average, Americans take 5,117 steps a day, which is a third of what the average Hazda takes. How much should we walk to ward off heart disease, certain cancers, and type 2 diabetes?<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The answer is 10,000 steps a day. Pedometer smartphone apps use that to change colour from a disappointed red or orange to a happy green. Where does this magical 10,000 step threshold come from? In the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympic Games, Abebe Bikila of Ethiopia defended his gold medal in the marathon, setting a new world record in 2:12:11:2. American sprinter and future NFL Hall of Famer Bob Hayes raced a hundred meters down a cinder track in only 10.06 seconds, tying the world record. And Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina, competing in her last Olympics, took home six more medals, bringing her total to 18 and making her the most decorated of any Olympian until American Michael Phelps swam along.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Olympics inspired the people of Japan. For the first time, the games were broadcast live on television, and by 1964, 90% of Americans had a TV. Researchers in Japan were concerned with how sedentary the Japanese public had become and with the rising prevalence of obesity in Japan. It was shown that Japanese were walking between 3,500 and 5,000 steps per day but that was not enough to be healthy.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The following year, a device that hooked onto people\u2019s waists counted the steps they took. It was called Manpo-kei which means \u201c10,000\u201d, po is \u201cstep\u201d, and keii is \u201cmeter\u201d. Thus the 10,000-step meter.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Smartphone walking apps default to 10,000 steps as a daily goal. Most fitbits do the same. Though the 10,000-step goal was based on some research, it was mostly a marketing gimmick. Yet over a half-century later, it is still with us. How many daily steps should we take?<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">From 2011 to 2015, 17,000 women whose age averaged 72 wore an accelerometer for a week. As a group, they averaged 5,499 steps a day, a shade more than the number a typical American adult takes. In the slightly over four years that followed, 504 of these women died. The number of daily steps was a good predictor for those who were still alive and who were not. Women who averaged at least 4,400 steps fared much better than those who took only 2,700. With daily steps up to 7,500, women continued to be better off those walking fewer steps. But that\u2019s where it plateaued \u2013 going beyond 7,500 steps did not make a difference.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">For a younger population, the plateau may not occur at 7,500 steps. The amount of walking required to yield health benefits, depends on age and activity level. It is recommended that everyone should take 2,000 more steps a day than currently average.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">One way to add that many steps to your routine is to get a dog. Dogs were the first animals domesticated by our species. Ancient DNA from a canine\u2019s rib found in Siberia reveals that humans and the wolf ancestors of dogs started hanging out together 30,000 years ago. In comparison, pigs and cows were domesticated closer to 10,000 years ago. As humans migrated around the globe, our dogs walked alongside us.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Even today, dog owners average almost 3,000 more daily steps than non-dog owners and are more likely to reach the recommended 150 minutes of walking per week.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In addition to preventing some cancers and reducing the risk of dying from cardiovascular diseases, a daily walk can prevent autoimmune diseases and can help ward off type 2 diabetes by lowering blood sugar levels. It improves sleep and lowers blood pressure. It decreases circulating cortisol levels, which helps reduce stress. In 40,000 women over 45, a thirty-minute daily walk reduced the risk of stroke by 27%. Despite these health benefits and admirable attempts to get our sedentary population on its feet, it is an uphill battle. Many futurists predict that our walking days are behind us. Could it be that humans will stop doing the very thing that defined us from the beginning?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">WALKING BACKWARDS 5 reasons to start walking backward<br \/>\n<\/strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">A new (to me, at least) spin on walking: backward walking, also known as retro-walking. Though it\u2019s trending on social media platforms, physical therapists and fitness trainers have been touting its benefits for years. It\u2019s a low-impact way to burn calories, strengthen your legs, test your coordination, become more flexible, and even reduce pain.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">After about 50 steps, I realized going in reverse was no walk in the park. It burned. I could feel the switch-up in my lower legs I don\u2019t with ordinary walking unless I\u2019m powering up a hill. There was a mental challenge too. I had no idea what was behind me, so I had to engage all my senses to ensure I stayed upright and didn\u2019t trip over any unexpected obstacles.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">When I told a handful of experts about my surprisingly fun retro-walking expedition, they agreed more people should make it part of their routine\u2014starting slowly, in a hazard-free area, for just a few minutes a day. There\u2019s a learning curve so if you\u2019re able to walk 1 m.p.h. backward, you\u2019re doing well.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"bp-mobileMDPlus bp-mobileLGPlus bp-tabletPlus bp-desktopPlus bp-desktopLGPlus bp-desktopXLGPlus no-touch\" data-fitt-page-type=\"prismarticle\">\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<div class=\"PageLayout page-container cf PageLayout--desktopLg PageLayout--prismarticle fitt-fade-in\">\n<div class=\"PageLayout__Main\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"main\">\n<div class=\"\">\n<div id=\"natgeo-template1-frame-1-module-1\" class=\"StackModule\">\n<div class=\"ScrollSpy_container\">\n<div id=\"themeProvider\" class=\"theme-natgeo \">\n<div id=\"FITTArticle\" class=\"FITT_Article_outer-container iJVrZ lqtkC glxIO HfYhe vUYNV dHdHP jLREf zXXje aGO \">\n<div class=\"FITT_Article_main \">\n<div class=\"dHdHP jLREf zXXje aGO eCClZ nTLv jLsYA gmuro TOSFd VmeZt sCkVm hkQai wGrlE MUuGM fciaN qQjt DhNVo Tgcqk IGLAf tWjkv \">\n<div class=\"PrismArticleBody SingleColumn xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC bOdfO \" data-testid=\"prism-article-body\">\n<div class=\"FITT_Article_main_group_wrapper VZTD UeCOM jIRH oimqG DjbQm UwdmX Xmrlz ReShI KaJdY lqtkC ssImf HfYhe RTHNs iJVrZ \" data-testid=\"prism-GridContainer\">\n<div class=\"Kiog kNVGM nvpSA qwdi bmjsw \" data-testid=\"prism-GridRow\">\n<div class=\"theme-e oBTii mrzah \" data-testid=\"prism-GridColumn\">\n<div>\n<div id=\"main-swiper\" class=\"swiper-container mobile-reflow swiper-container-initialized swiper-container-horizontal\">\n<div class=\"swiper-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"page9\" class=\"swiper-slide mobile-reflow swiper-slide-active\" data-hash=\"p9\" data-title=\"5 reasons to start walking backward\">\n<div id=\"1a5d634e-0b8d-4ce5-84b0-f4f00a6a262a\">\n<div id=\"emags_page_9\" class=\"article lightDarkMode\">\n<div id=\"2886ac0e-9305-4e6a-af2b-4d2dd07ba66a\" class=\"component-container component-layout emf_collection collection emf-layout-top-default emf-layout-width-full \">\n<div class=\"background-collection component\">\n<div id=\"191e451c-79ff-4f74-9ca8-0aaff95c6327\" class=\"component-container component-layout emf_text emf-layout-top-default emf-layout-width-wide \">\n<div id=\"ts_555167de-6591-4464-925c-4fcd35709089\" class=\"component emf_texteditor emf-paragraph readAlong\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>1. It\u2019s great for older people<br \/>\n<\/strong>Part of the appeal of walking backward is that it\u2019s suitable for people of any age and fitness level. It mitigates the impact of each step, reducing the force exerted on the knees and lower back. It\u2019s great for your balance and coordination, That\u2019s especially important for older adults, who are at a higher risk of falls. For a safe way to start, get on the treadmill backward without turning it on, grasp the handrails, and use your own power to move the belt.<br \/>\n<strong>2. You\u2019ll engage different muscles<br \/>\n<\/strong>Walking backward requires you to stand up straighter than you do when walking forward. By reversing your stride, you\u2019ll create a new challenge for the muscles in the abdomen, lower limbs, glutes, and back, since they\u2019ll be working opposite of how they usually do. According to one studY, people who walked backward three times a week for six weeks ended up with better quadriceps strength compared with those who walked forward for their exercise.<br \/>\n<strong>3. It can be good for people with injuries<br \/>\n<\/strong>Retro-walking has long been used for clinical and rehabilitation purposes. One study found that after six weeks of doing it, people with osteoarthritis in the knee had a bigger drop in pain and functional disability compared with those who walked in the typical way. Others have found that backward walking alleviates plantar fasciitis and lower back pain. Retro-walking is also used in occupational therapy. Older people might practice walking up to a kitchen sink, for example, then backward away from it. The ability to move in reverse can enhance \u201cpractical activities of daily living.<br \/>\n<strong>4. It could make you more flexible<br \/>\n<\/strong>Many of us sit all day long\u2014which leads to coiled-up, restricted muscles. Our hip flexors, or the muscles at the front of the thigh and the front of the hip, get tighter. When we walk backward, we\u2019re stretching that tissue\u2014leading to more flexibility, which is linked to improved physical performance, increased muscle blood flow, and a reduced risk of injuries.<br \/>\n<strong>5. Your gait might improve<br \/>\n<\/strong>Physios uses retro-walking to help people normalize their gait pattern, or how they walk. It\u2019s a way to tap into our neuromuscular programming and get people to work through a little limp or a range-of-motion restriction. Walking backward for just 20 or 30 ft. at a time is often enough to help some patients. It can also improve balance control. When you can\u2019t see what\u2019s behind you, you must instead rely on your muscles, joints, and vestibular system to keep you upright. You\u2019re having to feel where you are in space, and that information is being sent to the brain.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I have always loved walking &#8211; it remains the only passion (of many) that I have had my entire life.
