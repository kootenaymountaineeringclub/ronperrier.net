Most everyone wears a mask, even outdoors. Masks are required for entry to most businesses but hand sanitizer is not required.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Observations &#8211; El Salvador<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>1. People<\/strong>. They uniformly appear &#8220;mestizo&#8221; a mix of European (primarily Spanish) and indigenous people. They tend to be short and overweight. Most appear to make a livelihood in the itinerant selling industry &#8211; vegetables and fruit in markets and along highways.<br \/>\n<strong>2. Roads.<\/strong> The highways are of high quality with much appearing to be new pavement. Most have shoulders. Freeways connect the major areas. The roads leading into the major centers of Santa Ana and San Miguel are two-lane and clog up easily.<br \/>\nGas is $4.15\/US gallon (very cheap). Speed limits are generally 80km\/hour and occasionally 90 but there are no speed traps and I often drove well over the limit, even through towns &#8211; all depending on traffic.<br \/>\n<strong>3. Drivers.<\/strong> As always there are a few crazy speed freaks but not many here. Most drive well but pay no attention to the speed lanes of 4-lane highways. There are many slow vehicles that hold up traffic and passing on 2-lane roads can be challenging, especially as many drivers are cautious creating long lines.<br \/>\n<strong>4. Cicadas.<\/strong> With a life cycle of every 11 or 17 years, I passed through many isolated areas with a loud whining sound, just like cicadas.<br \/>\n<strong>5. Get Around<\/strong>. Old Blue Bird buses are the norm between towns. However many travels in open trucks from small to large. There are no seats and all stand or sit in precarious places on the box sides. I wonder how many people die in accidents in these? It appears very dangerous.<\/p>\n<p><strong>EL SALVADOR \u2013 WEST<\/strong> (San Salvador, Santa Ana, West of River Lempa) Mar 31-April 5, 2022<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Day 1<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<em>My original plan was to finish seeing all the countries in the Caribbean, but flying between Haiti, Jamaica, the Bahamas, and St Vincent is cumbersome as all go through Ft Lauderdale. I also didn\u2019t think I could navigate the Covid rules of the Bahamas or St Vincent. So I decided to go to El Salvador, my last country in Central America. The flight was from Port au Prince on JetBlue to Ft Lauderdale, then on Spirit to San Salvador on Sprint for CAD$272, a very good deal.<br \/>\nThe US Covid rules make little sense. If someone had a positive test within 90 days, they still must have a Doctors\u2019 note stating recovery. I saw this in the IATA info but hoped I could get away with it. They wouldn\u2019t let me board so I had to have an antigen test at the airport in Haiti for $85.<br \/>\nI arrived at 02:30 (the Spirit flight was late). The airport is 43 km from San Salvador and Uber and taxis are uncommon at this time of night. My incredible luck struck again. Sitting across the aisle was a young woman from Washington DC who had arranged a driver &#8211; and we were staying at the same hostel (La Zona)! The ride was $30 split between the two of us.

With offline maps, I was able to easily find my way. I eventually resorted to using MapsMe.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<strong>Get around.<\/strong> There are no share vans but an extensive bus network at 25 cents a ride. I could not figure out the bus&#8217;s destination so jumped on any bus going in the right direction and got off if it turned. At 25 cents, it was cheap. However, at the end of the day, I had great difficulty getting back to my hostel and traveled the same route three times before I realized I had to return to the Cathedral area.<br \/>\n<strong>National Museum of Anthropology David J.

It is incomplete. Officially, 75,000 died and thousands more are missing. Not all the names of the war&#8217;s victims were available when the monument project began, so the list is growing.

Not long afterward, it was destroyed by the eruption of the Loma Caldera. The site was discovered during the construction of grain-storage silos in 1976, when a clay-built structure was exposed by a bulldozer.<br \/>\n<\/span>The circumstances of the volcanic event led to the remarkable preservation of architecture and the artifacts of ancient inhabitants in their original positions of storage and use. It is\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">the best-preserved example of a pre-Hispanic village in Mesoamerica. 18 structures have been identified, all made of earth with thatch roofs: a large community (public) building on the side of a plaza, two houses of habitation that were part of domiciles, three storehouses, one kitchen, and a sweat bath. Rammed earth construction was used for the public buildings and the sauna, and wattle and daub (which is highly earthquake resistant) for household structures.<br \/>\n<\/span>The degree of preservation also applies to organic materials, from garden tools and bean-filled pots to sleeping mats, animal remains, and religious items that normally deteriorate in tropical conditions and were part of the subsistence and daily life of the inhabitants. These have been preserved as carbonized materials or as casts in the ash deposits. Several cultivated fields containing young and mature maize plants, a garden with a variety of herbs, a <em>henequen<\/em> (agave) garden, guava and cacao have also been found.<br \/>\nThis site is remarkable by the completeness of the evidence that it provides of everyday life in the Mesoamerican farming community of the seventh century A.D, which is without parallel in this cultural region.<br \/>\nDon&#8217;t miss the museum, which has great displays and a wonderful selection of well-painted pottery. The archaeological site is covered with 3 large metal-roofed buildings. The buildings have elaborate rammed earth walls.

A major processing center for El Salvador&#8217;s sizable coffee bean industry is located near Santa Ana. Santa Ana has become a tourist destination, especially for tourists eager to learn about Salvadoran culture and traditions.<br \/>\nThe city of Santa Ana is located on a meseta about 665 meters above sea level. The city has a year-round warm climate with an average temperature of around 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F). The main river is the Guajoyo River, a major tributary of the much larger Lempa River. There is a major Hydroelectric Power station at the Guajoyo River that provides electricity to most of the western sector of the country.<br \/>\nThe city is situated among a number of green hills, including Tecana Hill and the Hills of Santa Luc\u00eda. In the southern part of the municipality is the\u00a0Ilamatepec\u00a0volcano, the highest volcano in the country, which had a moderate eruption in 2005 that killed two people. Close to it is another famous volcano, Izalco, known to sailors throughout the mid-19th century and early 20th century as &#8220;The lighthouse of the Pacific&#8221; due to its constant eruptions.<br \/>\nHistory. The city of Santa Ana has a\u00a0pre-Columbian\u00a0origin that was depopulated by the eruption of Lake Ilopango at 250 DC. The city was founded by the Maya Poqomam in the classical period in 1200.<br \/>\nThe town was conquered by the Spanish between 1530 and 1540. <sup id=\"cite_ref-CCD_Santa_Ana_Historia_9-1\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>In 1894, a revolution that would overthrew President\u00a0Carlos Ezeta, who had ruled the country as de facto dictator occurred.

After the war, Santa Ana and all of El Salvador began to address the problem of rising crime rates,\u00a0mostly due to the existence of &#8220;maras&#8221; or gangs, mainly generated by the deportation of illegal immigrants from the United States.<br \/>\n<strong>Economy.<\/strong> The main economic engines of the city are in retail and manufacturing. In the north and west of the city are factories and assembly plants, mostly of foreign origin. The southern part of the city is more commercially developed, containing many restaurants, commercial banks, hotels and shopping malls.<br \/>\nSanta Ana has two main markets: the Col\u00f3n and Central Markets, only a few streets from one another, offering a great variety of products.<br \/>\nThe city has many old buildings such as:\u00a0Catedral de Santa Ana\u00a0(The Cathedral of Saint Anne),\u00a0Alcald\u00eda Municipal de Santa Ana\u00a0(Santa Ana\u00a0City Hall) and the\u00a0Teatro de Santa Ana\u00a0(Santa Ana Theater).<br \/>\n<strong>Museo Regional del Occidente.<\/strong> In a grand old bank building\u00a0is the main municipal museum with a\u00a0large collection of archaeological and contemporary history pieces,\u00a0a library, a cafeteria and a permanent exhibition on the History of La Moneda in El Salvador. $2 Note that it closes over noon.<br \/>\n<strong>Santa Ana Cathedral.<\/strong> <i lang=\"es\">(Catedral de la Se\u00f1ora Santa Ana<\/i>), is a\u00a0neo-Gothic\u00a0cathedral\u00a0built between 1902-1906.

A traditional fishery still exists.<br \/>\nOver 20 archaeological sites have been recorded in the environs of the lake, including a Late Preclassic settlement (400 BC- 200 AD), several Postclassic mound groups (900-1550 AD), and an early Colonial church ruin.

The country&#8217;s population in 2021 is estimated to be 6.8 million.<br \/>\nAmong the\u00a0Mesoamerican\u00a0nations that historically controlled the region are the\u00a0Lenca\u00a0(after 600 AD),\u00a0the\u00a0Mayans,]\u00a0and then the\u00a0Cuzcatlecs.\u00a0Archaeological monuments also suggest an early\u00a0Olmec\u00a0presence around the first millennium BC.\u00a0In the beginning of the 16th century, the\u00a0Spanish Empire conquered\u00a0the Central American territory, incorporating it into the Viceroyalty of\u00a0New Spain\u00a0ruled from\u00a0Mexico City. However the Viceroyalty of Mexico had little to no influence in the daily affairs of the isthmus, which was colonized in 1524. In 1609, the area was declared the\u00a0Captaincy General of Guatemala\u00a0by the Spanish, which included the territory that would become El Salvador until its independence from Spain in 1821. It was forcefully incorporated into the\u00a0First Mexican Empire, then seceded, joining the\u00a0Federal Republic of Central America\u00a0in 1823. When the federation dissolved in 1841, El Salvador became a sovereign state, then formed a short-lived union with Honduras and\u00a0Nicaragua\u00a0called the\u00a0Greater Republic of Central America, which lasted from 1895 to 1898.<br \/>\nFrom the late 19th to the mid-20th century, El Salvador endured chronic political and economic instability characterized by coups, revolts, and a succession of authoritarian rulers. Persistent socioeconomic inequality and civil unrest culminated in the\u00a0Salvadoran Civil War\u00a0from 1979 to 1992, fought between the military-led government backed by the\u00a0United States, and a coalition of left-wing\u00a0guerrilla\u00a0groups. The conflict ended with the\u00a0Chapultepec Peace Accords. This negotiated settlement established a multiparty constitutional republic, which remains in place to this day.<br \/>\nWhile this Civil War was going on in the country large numbers of Salvadorans emigrated to the United States, and by 2008 they were one of the largest immigrant groups in the US.<br \/>\nEl Salvador&#8217;s economy has historically been dominated by agriculture, beginning with the Spanish taking control of the indigenous cacao crop in the 16th century, with production centered in\u00a0Izalco, and the use of balsam from the ranges of\u00a0La Libertad\u00a0and\u00a0Ahuachapan. This was followed by a boom in the use of the\u00a0indigo plant\u00a0(a\u00f1il\u00a0in Spanish) in the 19th century, mainly for its use as a dye.\u00a0Thereafter the focus shifted to\u00a0coffee, which by the early 20th century accounted for 90% of export earnings.\u00a0El Salvador has since reduced its dependence on coffee and embarked on diversifying its economy by opening up trade and financial links and expanding the manufacturing sector.\u00a0The\u00a0col\u00f3n, the currency of El Salvador since 1892, was replaced by the\u00a0United States dollar\u00a0in 2001.<br \/>\nEl Salvador ranks 124th among 189 countries in the\u00a0Human Development Index.\u00a0In addition to high rates of poverty and\u00a0gang-related violent crime, El Salvador is the most egalitarian country in terms of\u00a0income inequality\u00a0in Latin America.\u00a0Among 77 countries included in a 2021 study, El Salvador was one of the least complex economies for doing business.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HISTORY<br \/>\n<\/strong>Tomayate is a palaeontological site located on the banks of the river of the same name in the municipality of\u00a0Apopa. The site has produced abundant Salvadoran\u00a0megafauna\u00a0fossils belonging to the\u00a0Pleistocene. The palaeontological site was discovered accidentally in 2000, and in the following year, an excavation by the Museum of Natural History of El Salvador revealed several remnants of\u00a0Cuvieronius\u00a0and 18 other species of vertebrates including\u00a0giant tortoises,\u00a0Megatherium,\u00a0Glyptodon,\u00a0Toxodon, extinct horses, paleo-llamas. The site stands out from most Central American Pleistocene deposits, being more ancient and much richer, which provides valuable information of the\u00a0Great American Interchange, in which the Central American isthmus land bridge was paramount.

Sophisticated civilization in El Salvador dates to its settlement by the indigenous\u00a0Lenca\u00a0people; theirs was the first and the oldest indigenous civilization to settle in there.\u00a0They were a union of Central American tribes that oversaw most of the isthmus from southern Guatemala to northern Panama, which they called Managuara.\u00a0The Lenca of eastern El Salvador trace their origins to specific caves with ancient pictographs dating back to at least 600 AD\u00a0and some sources say as far back as 7000 BC.\u00a0There was also a presence of\u00a0Olmecs, although their role is unclear. Their influence remains recorded in the form of stone monuments and artifacts preserved in western El Salvador, as well as the national museum.\u00a0A Mayan population settled there in the\u00a0Formative\u00a0period, but their numbers were greatly diminished when the\u00a0Ilopango\u00a0supervolcano eruption caused a massive exodus.<br \/>\nCenturies later the area&#8217;s occupants were displaced by the\u00a0Pipil people,\u00a0Nahua-speaking groups who migrated from\u00a0Anahuac\u00a0beginning around 800 AD and occupied the central and western regions of El Salvador.\u00a0The Nahua Pipil were the last indigenous people to arrive in El Salvador.\u00a0They called their territory\u00a0Kuskatan, a\u00a0Nawat\u00a0word\u00a0meaning &#8220;The Place of Precious Jewels,&#8221;\u00a0back-formed\u00a0into\u00a0Classical Nahuatl\u00a0C\u014dzcatl\u0101n, and Hispanicized as\u00a0Cuzcatl\u00e1n.\u00a0It was the largest domain in Salvadoran territory up until European contact. The term\u00a0Cuzcatleco\u00a0is commonly used to identify someone of Salvadoran heritage, although the majority of the eastern population has indigenous heritage of Lenca origin, as do their place names such as\u00a0Intipuca,\u00a0Chirilagua, and\u00a0Lolotique.<br \/>\nMost of the archaeological sites in western El Salvador such as\u00a0Lago de Guija\u00a0and\u00a0Joya De Ceren\u00a0indicate a pre-Columbian Mayan culture.\u00a0Cihuatan\u00a0shows signs of material trade with northern Nahua culture, eastern Mayan and Lenca culture, and southern Nicaraguan and Costa Rican indigenous culture.\u00a0Tazumal&#8217;s smaller B1-2 structure shows a\u00a0talud-tablero\u00a0style of architecture that is associated with Nahua culture and corresponds with their migration history from Anahuac. In eastern El Salvador, the Lenca site of\u00a0Quelepa\u00a0is highlighted as a major pre-Columbian cultural center and demonstrates links to the Mayan site of\u00a0Copan\u00a0in western Honduras as well as the previously mentioned sites in\u00a0Chalchuapa, and\u00a0Cara Sucia\u00a0in western El Salvador. An investigation of the site of La Laguna in\u00a0Usulutan\u00a0has also produced Copador items that link it to the Lenca-Maya trade route.<br \/>\n<strong>European and African arrival (1522). <\/strong>By 1521, the indigenous population of the Mesoamerican area had been drastically reduced by the\u00a0smallpox epidemic\u00a0that was spreading throughout the territory, although it had not yet reached pandemic levels in Cuzcatl\u00e1n or the northern portion Managuara.\u00a0The first known visit by Spaniards to what is now Salvadoran territory was made by the admiral\u00a0Andr\u00e9s Ni\u00f1o, who led an expedition to Central America. He disembarked in the\u00a0Gulf of Fonseca\u00a0on 31 May 1522, at\u00a0Meanguera island, naming it Petronila,\u00a0and then traversed to\u00a0Jiquilisco Bay\u00a0on the mouth of\u00a0Lempa River. The first indigenous people to have contact with the Spanish were the Lenca of eastern El Salvador.<br \/>\n<strong>Conquest of Cuzcatl\u00e1n and Managuara<br \/>\n<\/strong>In 1524, after participating in the\u00a0conquest of the Aztec Empire,\u00a0Pedro de Alvarado, his brother Gonzalo, and their men crossed the\u00a0Rio Paz\u00a0southward into Cuzcatlec territory. The Spaniards were disappointed to discover that the Pipil had no gold or jewels like those they had found in Guatemala or Mexico,\u00a0but they recognized the richness of the land&#8217;s volcanic soil.<br \/>\nPedro Alvarado led the first incursion to extend their dominion to the domain of Cuzcatlan in June 1524.\u00a0When he arrived at the borders of the kingdom, he saw that civilians had been evacuated. Cuzcatlec warriors moved to the coastal city of\u00a0Acajutla\u00a0and waited for Alvarado and his forces. Alvarado approached, confident that the result would be similar to what occurred in Mexico and Guatemala. He thought he would easily deal with this new indigenous force since the Mexican allies on his side and the Pipil spoke a similar language.<br \/>\nAlvarado described the Cuzcatlec soldiers as having shields decorated with colourful exotic feathers, a vest-like armour made of three-inch cotton which arrows could not penetrate, and long spears. Both armies suffered many casualties, with a wounded Alvarado retreating and losing a lot of his men, especially among the Mexican Indian auxiliaries. Once his army had regrouped, Alvarado decided to head to the Cuzcatlan capital and again faced armed Cuzcatlec. Wounded, unable to fight and hiding in the cliffs, Alvarado sent his Spanish men on their horses to approach the Cuzcatlec to see if they would fear the horses, but they did not retreat, Alvarado recalls in his letters to\u00a0Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s.<br \/>\nThe Cuzcatlec attacked again, and on this occasion stole Spanish weaponry. Alvarado retreated and sent Mexican messengers to demand that the Cuzcatlec warriors return the stolen weapons and surrender to their opponent&#8217;s king. The Cuzcatlec responded with the famous response, &#8220;If you want your weapons, come get them&#8221;. As days passed, Alvarado, fearing an ambush, sent more Mexican messengers to negotiate, but these messengers never came back and were presumably executed.<br \/>\nThe Spanish efforts were firmly resisted by Pipil and their Mayan-speaking neighbours. They defeated the Spaniards and what was left of their\u00a0Tlaxcalan\u00a0allies, forcing them to withdraw to Guatemala. After being wounded, Alvarado abandoned the war and appointed his brother,\u00a0Gonzalo de Alvarado, to continue the task. Two subsequent expeditions (the first in 1525, followed by a smaller group in 1528) brought the Pipil under Spanish control, since the Pipil also were weakened by a regional epidemic of smallpox. In 1525, the conquest of Cuzcatl\u00e1n was completed and the city of San Salvador was established. The Spanish faced much resistance from the Pipil and were not able to reach eastern El Salvador, the area of the Lencas.<br \/>\nIn 1526 the Spanish founded the garrison town of\u00a0San Miguel\u00a0in northern Managuara\u2014territory of the Lenca, headed by another explorer and conquistador,\u00a0Luis de Moscoso Alvarado, nephew of Pedro Alvarado. Oral history holds that a Maya-Lenca crown princess, Antu Silan Ulap I, organized resistance to the conquistadors.\u00a0The kingdom of the Lenca was alarmed by de Moscoso&#8217;s invasion, and Antu Silan travelled from village to village, uniting all the Lenca towns in present-day El Salvador and Honduras against the Spaniards. Through surprise attacks and overwhelming numbers, they were able to drive the Spanish out of San Miguel and destroy the garrison.<br \/>\nFor ten years the Lencas prevented the Spanish from building a permanent settlement. Then the Spanish returned with more soldiers, including about 2,000 forced conscripts from indigenous communities in Guatemala. They pursued the Lenca leaders further up into the mountains of\u00a0Intibuc\u00e1.<br \/>\nAntu Silan Ulap eventually handed over control of the Lenca resistance to\u00a0Lempira\u00a0(also called Empira). Lempira was noteworthy among indigenous leaders in that he mocked the Spanish by wearing their clothes after capturing them and using their weapons captured in battle. Lempira fought in command of thousands of Lenca forces for six more years in Managuara until he was killed in battle. The remaining Lenca forces retreated into the hills. The Spanish were then able to rebuild their garrison town of San Miguel in 1537.<br \/>\n<strong>Colonial period (1525\u20131821). <\/strong>During the colonial period, San Salvador and San Miguel were part of the Captaincy General of Guatemala, also known as the Kingdom of Guatemala (Spanish:\u00a0Reino de Guatemala), created in 1609 as an administrative division of\u00a0New Spain. The Salvadoran territory was administered by the mayor of Sonsonate, with San Salvador being established as an\u00a0intendencia\u00a0in 1786.<br \/>\nIn 1811, a combination of internal and external factors motivated Central American elites to attempt to gain independence from the Spanish Crown. The most important internal factors were the desire of local elites to control the country&#8217;s affairs free of involvement from Spanish authorities, and the long-standing Creole aspiration for independence. The main external factors motivating the independence movement were the success of the\u00a0French\u00a0and\u00a0American\u00a0revolutions in the 18th century, and the weakening of the Spanish Crown&#8217;s military power as a result of the\u00a0Napoleonic Wars, with the resulting inability to control its colonies effectively.<br \/>\nIn November 1811 Salvadoran priest\u00a0Jos\u00e9 Mat\u00edas Delgado\u00a0rang the bells of Iglesia La Merced in San Salvador, calling for insurrection and launching the\u00a01811 Independence Movement. This insurrection was suppressed, and many of its leaders were arrested and served sentences in jail. Another insurrection was launched in 1814, which was also suppressed.<br \/>\n<strong>Independence (1821)<\/strong>. In 1821 in light of unrest in Guatemala, Spanish authorities capitulated and signed the\u00a0Act of Independence of Central America, which released all of the Captaincy of Guatemala (comprising current territories of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica and the Mexican state of\u00a0Chiapas) from Spanish rule and declared its independence. In 1821, El Salvador joined Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua in a union named the\u00a0Federal Republic of Central America.<br \/>\nIn early 1822, the authorities of the newly independent Central American provinces, meeting in Guatemala City, voted to join the newly constituted\u00a0First Mexican Empire\u00a0under\u00a0Agust\u00edn de Iturbide. El Salvador resisted, insisting on autonomy for the Central American countries. A Mexican military detachment marched to San Salvador and suppressed dissent, but with the fall of Iturbide on 19 March 1823, the army decamped back to Mexico. Shortly thereafter, the authorities of the provinces revoked the vote to join Mexico, deciding instead to form a federal union of the five remaining provinces. (Chiapas permanently joined Mexico at this juncture.) When the Federal Republic of Central America dissolved in 1841, El Salvador maintained its own government until it joined Honduras and Nicaragua in 1896 to form the\u00a0Greater Republic of Central America, which dissolved in 1898.<br \/>\nAfter the mid-19th century, the economy was based on coffee growing. As the world market for indigo withered away, the economy prospered or suffered as the world coffee price fluctuated. The enormous profits that coffee yielded as a monoculture export served as an impetus for the concentration of land into the hands of an oligarchy of just a few families. Throughout the last half of the 19th century, a succession of presidents from the ranks of the Salvadoran oligarchy, nominally both conservative and liberal, generally agreed on the promotion of coffee as the predominant\u00a0cash crop, the development of infrastructure (railroads and port facilities) primarily in support of the coffee trade, the elimination of communal landholdings to facilitate further coffee production, the passage of anti-vagrancy\u00a0laws to ensure that displaced\u00a0campesinos\u00a0and other rural residents provided sufficient labour for the coffee fincas (plantations), and the suppression of rural discontent. In 1912, the national guard was created as a rural police force.<br \/>\n<strong>20th century<\/strong>. In 1898, General\u00a0Tomas Regalado\u00a0gained power by force, deposing\u00a0Rafael Antonio Guti\u00e9rrez\u00a0and ruling as president until 1903. Once in office he revived the practice of presidents designating their successors. After serving his term, he remained active in the Army of El Salvador and was killed 11 July 1906, at El Jicaro during a\u00a0war against Guatemala. Until 1913 El Salvador was politically stable, with undercurrents of popular discontent. When President\u00a0Manuel Enrique Araujo\u00a0was killed in 1913, many hypotheses were advanced for the political motive of his murder.<br \/>\nAraujo&#8217;s administration was followed by the Melendez-Quinonez dynasty that lasted from 1913 to 1927.\u00a0Pio Romero Bosque, ex-Minister of the Government and a trusted collaborator of the dynasty, succeeded President\u00a0Jorge Mel\u00e9ndez\u00a0and in 1930 announced free elections, in which\u00a0Arturo Araujo\u00a0came to power on 1 March 1931 in what was considered the country&#8217;s first freely contested election. His government lasted only nine months before it was overthrown by junior military officers who accused his Labor Party of lacking political and governmental experience and of using its government offices inefficiently. President Araujo faced general popular discontent, as the people had expected economic reforms and the redistribution of land. There were demonstrations in front of the National Palace from the first week of his administration. His vice president and minister of war was General\u00a0Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez.<br \/>\nIn December 1931, a\u00a0coup d&#8217;\u00e9tat was organized\u00a0by junior officers and led by Mart\u00ednez. Only the First Regiment of Cavalry and the National Police defended the presidency (the National Police had been on its payroll), but later that night, after hours of fighting, the badly outnumbered defenders surrendered to rebel forces. The Directorate, composed of officers, hid behind a shadowy figure,\u00a0a rich anti-Communist banker called Rodolfo Duke, and later installed the ardent fascist Mart\u00ednez as president. The revolt was probably caused by the army&#8217;s discontent at not having been paid by President Araujo for some months. Araujo left the National Palace and unsuccessfully tried to organize forces to defeat the revolt.<br \/>\nThe U.S. Minister in El Salvador met with the Directorate and later recognized the government of Mart\u00ednez, which agreed to hold presidential elections. He resigned six months prior to running for re-election, winning back the presidency as the only candidate on the ballot. He ruled from 1935 to 1939, then from 1939 to 1943. He began a fourth term in 1944 but resigned in May after a general strike. Mart\u00ednez had said he was going to respect the constitution, which stipulated he could not be re-elected, but he refused to keep his promise.<br \/>\n<strong>La Matanza<\/strong>. From December 1931, the year of the coup that brought Mart\u00ednez to power, there was brutal suppression of rural resistance. The most notable event was the February\u00a01932 Salvadoran peasant uprising, originally led by\u00a0Farabundo Mart\u00ed\u00a0and Abel Cuenca, and university students Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata, but these leaders were captured before the planned insurrection. Only Cuenca survived; the other insurgents were killed by the government. After the capture of the movement leaders, the insurrection erupted in a disorganized and mob-controlled fashion, resulting in government repression that was later referred to as La Matanza (The Massacre), because tens of thousands of citizens died in the ensuing chaos on the orders of President Martinez.<br \/>\nIn the unstable political climate of the previous few years, the social activist and revolutionary leader Farabundo Mart\u00ed helped found the Communist Party of Central America, and led a Communist alternative to the Red Cross called\u00a0International Red Aid, serving as one of its representatives. Their goal was to help poor and underprivileged Salvadorans through the use of\u00a0Marxist\u2013Leninist\u00a0ideology (strongly rejecting\u00a0Stalinism). In December 1930, at the height of the country&#8217;s economic and social depression, Mart\u00ed was once again exiled because of his popularity among the nation&#8217;s poor and rumours of his upcoming nomination for president the following year. Once Arturo Araujo was elected president in 1931, Mart\u00ed returned to El Salvador, and along with Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata began the movement that was later truncated by the military.<br \/>\nThey helped start a guerrilla revolt of indigenous farmers. The government responded by killing over 30,000 people at what was to have been a &#8220;peaceful meeting&#8221; in 1932. The peasant uprising against Mart\u00ednez was crushed by the Salvadoran military ten days after it had begun. The Communist-led rebellion, fomented by collapsing coffee prices, enjoyed some initial success, but was soon drowned in a bloodbath. President Mart\u00ednez, who had toppled an elected government only weeks earlier, ordered the defeated Mart\u00ed shot after a perfunctory hearing.<br \/>\nHistorically, the high Salvadoran population density has contributed to tensions with neighbouring\u00a0Honduras, as land-poor Salvadorans emigrated to less densely populated Honduras and established themselves as squatters on unused or underused land. This phenomenon was a major cause of the\u00a01969 Football War\u00a0between the two countries.\u00a0As many as 130,000 Salvadorans were forcibly expelled or fled from Honduras.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Christian Democratic Party\u00a0(PDC) and the\u00a0National Conciliation Party\u00a0(PCN) were active in Salvadoran politics from 1960 until 2011, when they were disbanded by the Supreme Court because they had failed to win enough votes in the 2004 presidential election;\u00a0Both parties have since reconstituted. They share common ideals, but one represents the middle class and the latter the interests of the Salvadoran military.<br \/>\nPDC leader\u00a0Jos\u00e9 Napole\u00f3n Duarte\u00a0was the mayor of\u00a0San Salvador\u00a0from 1964 to 1970, winning three elections during the regime of PCN President\u00a0Julio Adalberto Rivera Carballo, who allowed free elections for mayors and the National Assembly. Duarte later ran for president with a political grouping called the\u00a0National Opposition Union\u00a0(UNO) but was defeated in the 1972 presidential elections. He lost to the ex-Minister of Interior, Col.\u00a0Arturo Armando Molina, in an election that was widely viewed as fraudulent; Molina was declared the winner even though Duarte was said to have received a majority of the votes. Duarte, at some army officers&#8217; request, supported a revolt to protest the election fraud, but was captured, tortured and later exiled. Duarte returned to the country in 1979 to enter politics after working on projects in Venezuela as an engineer.<br \/>\n<strong>Salvadoran Civil War (1979\u20131992). <\/strong>On 15 October 1979, a\u00a0coup d&#8217;\u00e9tat\u00a0brought the\u00a0Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador\u00a0to power. It nationalized many private companies and took over much privately owned land. The purpose of this new junta was to stop the revolutionary movement already underway in response to Duarte&#8217;s stolen election. Nevertheless, the oligarchy opposed\u00a0agrarian reform, and a junta formed with young reformist elements from the army such as Colonels\u00a0Adolfo Arnoldo Majano\u00a0and\u00a0Jaime Abdul Guti\u00e9rrez,\u00a0as well as with progressives such as\u00a0Guillermo Ungo\u00a0and Alvarez.<br \/>\nPressure from the oligarchy soon dissolved the junta because of its inability to control the army in its repression of the people fighting for unionization rights, agrarian reform, better wages, accessible health care and freedom of expression. In the meantime, the guerrilla movement was spreading to all sectors of Salvadoran society. Middle and high school students were organized in MERS (Movimiento Estudiantil Revolucionario de Secundaria, Revolutionary Movement of Secondary Students); college students were involved with AGEUS (Asociacion de Estudiantes Universitarios Salvadorenos; Association of Salvadoran College Students); and workers were organized in BPR (Bloque Popular Revolucionario, Popular Revolutionary Block). In October 1980, several other major guerrilla groups of the Salvadoran left had formed the\u00a0Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front, or FMLN. By the end of the 1970s, government-contracted death squads were killing about 10 people each day. Meanwhile, the FMLN had 6,000 \u2013 8,000 active guerrillas and hundreds of thousands of part-time militia, supporters, and sympathizers.<br \/>\nThe U.S. supported and financed the creation of a second junta to change the political environment and stop the spread of a leftist insurrection. Napole\u00f3n Duarte was recalled from his exile in Venezuela to head this new junta. However, a revolution was already underway and his new role as head of the junta was seen by the general population as opportunistic. He was unable to influence the outcome of the insurrection.<br \/>\n\u00d3scar Romero, the\u00a0Roman Catholic\u00a0Archbishop of San Salvador, denounced injustices and massacres committed against civilians by government forces. He was considered &#8220;the voice of the voiceless&#8221;, but he was assassinated by a\u00a0death squad\u00a0while saying Mass on 24 March 1980.\u00a0Some consider this to be the beginning of the full\u00a0Salvadoran Civil War, which lasted from 1980 to 1992.<br \/>\nAn unknown number of people &#8220;disappeared&#8221; during the conflict, and the UN reports that more than 75,000 were killed.\u00a0The\u00a0Salvadoran Army&#8217;s US-trained\u00a0Atlacatl Battalion\u00a0was responsible for the\u00a0El Mozote massacre\u00a0where more than 800 civilians were murdered, over half of them children, the\u00a0El Calabozo massacre, and the\u00a0murder of UCA scholars.<br \/>\nOn 16 January 1992, the government of El Salvador, represented by president\u00a0Alfredo Cristiani, and the\u00a0FMLN, represented by the commanders of the five guerrilla groups \u2013\u00a0Shafik Handal,\u00a0Joaqu\u00edn Villalobos,\u00a0Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n, Francisco Jovel and\u00a0Eduardo Sancho, all signed peace agreements brokered by the United Nations ending the 12-year civil war. This event, held at\u00a0Chapultepec Castle\u00a0in Mexico, was attended by U.N. dignitaries and other representatives of the international community. After signing the armistice, the president stood up and shook hands with all the now ex-guerrilla commanders, an action which was widely admired.<br \/>\n<strong>Post-war (1992\u2013present).\u00a0<\/strong>The so-called\u00a0Chapultepec Peace Accords\u00a0mandated reductions in the size of the army, and the dissolution of the National Police, the Treasury Police, the National Guard and the Civilian Defence, a paramilitary group. A new Civil Police was to be organized. Judicial immunity for crimes committed by the armed forces ended; the government agreed to submit to the recommendations of a\u00a0Commission on the Truth for El Salvador\u00a0(Comisi\u00f3n de la Verdad Para El Salvador), which would &#8220;investigate serious acts of violence occurring since 1980, and the natur,e and effects of the violence, and&#8230;recommend methods of promoting national reconciliation&#8221;. In 1993 the Commission delivered its findings reporting human rights violations on both sides of the conflict.\u00a0Five days later the Salvadoran legislature passed an amnesty law for all acts of violence during the period.<br \/>\nFrom 1989 until 2004, Salvadorans favoured the\u00a0Nationalist Republican Alliance\u00a0(ARENA) party, voting in ARENA presidents in every election (Alfredo Cristiani,\u00a0Armando Calder\u00f3n Sol,\u00a0Francisco Flores P\u00e9rez,\u00a0Antonio Saca) until 2009. The unsuccessful attempts of the left-wing party to win presidential elections led to its selection of a journalist rather than a former guerrilla leader as a candidate. On 15 March 2009,\u00a0Mauricio Funes, a television figure, became the first president from the\u00a0Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front\u00a0(FMLN) party. He was inaugurated on 1 June 2009.\u00a0One focus of the Funes government has been revealing the alleged corruption from the past government.<br \/>\nARENA formally expelled Saca from the party in December 2009. With 12 loyalists in the National Assembly, Saca established his own party, GANA (Gran Alianza por la Unidad Nacional or\u00a0Grand Alliance for National Unity), and entered into a tactical legislative alliance with the FMLN.\u00a0After three years in office, with Saca&#8217;s GANA party providing the FMLN with a legislative majority, Funes had not taken action to either investigate or to bring corrupt former officials to justice.<br \/>\nEconomic reforms since the early 1990s brought major benefits in terms of improved social conditions, diversification of the export sector, and access to international financial markets at investment grade level. Crime remains a major problem for the investment climate. Early in the new millennium, El Salvador&#8217;s government created the Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales\u00a0\u2014 the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARN)\u00a0\u2014 in response to climate change concerns.<br \/>\nIn March 2014,\u00a0Salvador Sanchez Ceren\u00a0of the FMLN narrowly won the\u00a0election. He was sworn in as president on 31 May 2014. He was the first former guerrilla to become the President of El Salvador.<br \/>\nIn October 2017, an El Salvador court ruled that former leftist President Mauricio Funes, in office since 2009 until 2014, and one of his sons, had illegally enriched themselves. Funes had sought asylum in Nicaragua in 2016.<br \/>\nIn September 2018, former conservative President\u00a0Antonio \u201cTony\u201d Saca, in office since 2004 until 2009, was sentenced to 10 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to diverting more than US$300 million in state funds to his own businesses and third parties.<br \/>\n<strong>Presidency of Nayib Bukele since 2019<\/strong>. On 1 June 2019,\u00a0Nayib Bukele\u00a0became the new President of El Salvador.\u00a0Bukele was the winner of February\u00a02019 presidential election. He represented the center-right\u00a0Grand Alliance for National Unity\u00a0(GANA). Two main parties, left-wing FMLN and the right-wing ARENA, had dominated politics in El Salvador over the past three decades.<br \/>\nAccording to a report by the\u00a0International Crisis Group\u00a0(ICG) 2020, the homicide rates, murders in El Salvador had dropped by as much as 60 percent since Bukele became president in June 2019. The reason might have been a \u201cnon-aggression deal\u201d between parts of the government and the gangs.<br \/>\nThe party\u00a0Nuevas Ideas, founded by Bukele, with its allies (GANA\u2013Nuevas Ideas) won around two-thirds of the vote in the February 2021\u00a0legislative elections. His party won supermajority of 56 seats in the 84-seat parliament. The supermajority enables Bukele to appoint judges and to pass laws, for instance, to remove presidential term limits.\u00a0On 8 June 2021, at the initiative of president Bukele, pro-government deputies in the\u00a0Legislative Assembly of El Salvador\u00a0voted\u00a0legislation\u00a0to make\u00a0Bitcoin\u00a0legal tender\u00a0in the country.\u00a0In September 2021, El Salvador&#8217;s Supreme Court decided to allow Bukele to run for a second term in 2024, despite the fact that the constitution prohibits the president to serve two consecutive terms in office. The decision was organized by judges appointed to the court by President Bukele.<br \/>\nIn January 2022, The\u00a0International Monetary Fund\u00a0(IMF) urged El Salvador to reverse its decision to make cryptocurrency Bitcoin legal tender. Bitcoin had rapidly lost about half of its value, meaning economic difficulties for El Salvador. President Bukele has announced his plans to build a\u00a0Bitcoin city\u00a0at the base of a volcano in El Salvador.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GEOGRAPHY<br \/>\n<\/strong>El Salvador lies in the isthmus of Central America between latitudes\u00a013\u00b0\u00a0and\u00a015\u00b0N, and longitudes\u00a087\u00b0\u00a0and\u00a091\u00b0W. It stretches 270\u00a0km (168\u00a0mi) from west-northwest to east-southeast and 142\u00a0km (88\u00a0mi) north to south, with a total area of 21,041\u00a0km2\u00a0(8,124\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). As the smallest country in continental America, El Salvador is affectionately called\u00a0Pulgarcito de America\u00a0(the &#8220;Tom Thumb\u00a0of the Americas&#8221;). El Salvador shares borders with Guatemala and Honduras, the total national boundary length is 546\u00a0km (339\u00a0mi): 126 miles (203\u00a0km) with Guatemala and 343\u00a0km (213\u00a0mi) with Honduras. It is the only Central American country that has no Caribbean coastline. The coastline on the Pacific is 307\u00a0km (191\u00a0mi) long.<br \/>\nEl Salvador has over 300 rivers, the most important of which is the\u00a0Rio Lempa. Originating in Guatemala, the Rio Lempa cuts across the northern range of mountains, flows along much of the central plateau, and cuts through the southern volcanic range to empty into the Pacific. It is El Salvador&#8217;s only navigable river. It and its tributaries drain about half of the country&#8217;s area. Other rivers are generally short and drain the Pacific lowlands or flow from the central plateau through gaps in the southern mountain range to the Pacific. These include the\u00a0Goascor\u00e1n,\u00a0Jiboa,\u00a0Torola,\u00a0Paz\u00a0and the\u00a0R\u00edo Grande de San Miguel.<br \/>\nThere are several lakes enclosed by volcanic craters in El Salvador, the most important of which are\u00a0Lake Ilopango\u00a0(70\u00a0km2\u00a0or 27\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and\u00a0Lake Coatepeque\u00a0(26\u00a0km2\u00a0or 10\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).\u00a0Lake G\u00fcija\u00a0is El Salvador&#8217;s largest natural lake (44\u00a0km2\u00a0or 17\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). Several artificial lakes were created by the damming of the Lempa, the largest of which is\u00a0Cerr\u00f3n Grande Reservoir\u00a0(135\u00a0km2\u00a0or 52\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). There are a total 320\u00a0km2\u00a0(123.6\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of water within El Salvador&#8217;s borders.<br \/>\nThe highest point in El Salvador is\u00a0Cerro El Pital, at 2,730 metres (8,957\u00a0ft), on the border with Honduras. Two parallel mountain ranges cross El Salvador to the west with a central plateau between them and a narrow coastal plain hugging the Pacific. These physical features divide the country into two physiographic regions. The mountain ranges and central plateau, covering 85% of the land, comprise the interior highlands. The remaining coastal plains are referred to as the Pacific lowlands.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Climate:<\/strong> El Salvador has a\u00a0tropical climate\u00a0with pronounced wet and dry seasons. Temperatures vary primarily with elevation and show little seasonal change. The Pacific lowlands are uniformly hot; the central plateau and mountain areas are more moderate. The rainy season extends from May to October; this time of year is referred to as\u00a0invierno\u00a0or winter. Almost all the annual rainfall occurs during this period; yearly totals, particularly on southern-facing mountain slopes, can be as high as 2170\u00a0mm. Protected areas and the central plateau receive less, although still significant, amounts. Rainfall during this season generally comes from low pressure systems formed over the Pacific and usually falls in heavy afternoon thunderstorms.<br \/>\nFrom November through April, the northeast\u00a0trade winds\u00a0control weather patterns; this time of year is referred to as\u00a0verano, or summer. During these months, air flowing from the Caribbean has lost most of its precipitation while passing over the mountains in Honduras. By the time this air reaches El Salvador, it is dry, hot, and hazy, and the country experiences hot weather, excluding the northern higher mountain ranges, where temperatures are generally cooler.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Natural disasters.<br \/>\n<\/strong><em>Extreme weather events.<\/em> El Salvador&#8217;s position on the Pacific Ocean also makes it subject to severe weather conditions, including heavy rainstorms and severe droughts, both of which may be made more extreme by the\u00a0El Ni\u00f1o\u00a0and\u00a0La Ni\u00f1a\u00a0effects.\u00a0Hurricanes occasionally form in the Pacific with the notable exception of\u00a0Hurricane Mitch, which formed in the Atlantic and crossed Central America.<br \/>\nIn the summer of 2001 a severe drought destroyed 80% of El Salvador&#8217;s crops, causing famine in the countryside.\u00a0On 4 October 2005, severe rains resulted in dangerous flooding and landslides, which caused at least 50 deaths.<br \/>\n<em>Earthquakes and volcanic activity: <\/em>El Salvador lies along the Pacific\u00a0Ring of Fire\u00a0and is thus subject to significant tectonic activity, including frequent\u00a0earthquakes\u00a0and\u00a0volcanic\u00a0activity. The capital San Salvador was destroyed in 1756 and 1854, and it suffered heavy damage in the 1919, 1982, and 1986 tremors. Recent examples include the earthquake on 13 January 2001 that measured 7.7 on the\u00a0Richter magnitude scale\u00a0and caused a\u00a0landslide\u00a0that killed more than 800 people;\u00a0and another earthquake only a month later, on 13 February 2001, that killed 255 people and damaged about 20% of the country&#8217;s housing. A\u00a05.7 Mw\u00a0earthquake in 1986 resulted in 1,500 deaths, 10,000 injuries, and 100,000 people left homeless.<br \/>\nEl Salvador has over twenty volcanoes; two of them, San Miguel and\u00a0Izalco, have been active in recent years. From the early 19th century to the mid-1950s, Izalco erupted with a regularity that earned it the name &#8220;Lighthouse of the Pacific&#8221;. Its brilliant flares were clearly visible for great distances at sea, and at night its glowing lava turned it into a brilliant luminous cone. The most recent destructive volcanic eruption took place on 1 October 2005, when the\u00a0Santa Ana Volcano\u00a0spewed a cloud of ash, hot mud and rocks that fell on nearby villages and caused two deaths. The most severe volcanic eruption in this area occurred in the 5th century AD when the\u00a0Ilopango\u00a0volcano erupted with a\u00a0VEI\u00a0strength of 6, producing widespread\u00a0pyroclastic flows\u00a0and devastating\u00a0Mayan cities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Flora and fauna.\u00a0<\/strong>It is estimated that there are 500 species of birds, 1,000 species of butterflies, 400 species of orchids, 800 species of trees, and 800 species of marine fish in El Salvador.<br \/>\nThere are eight species of sea turtles in the world; six of them nest on the coasts of Central America, and four make their home on the Salvadoran coast: the\u00a0leatherback turtle, the\u00a0hawksbill, the\u00a0green sea turtle, and the\u00a0olive ridley. The hawksbill is critically endangered.<br \/>\nRecent conservation efforts provide hope for the future of the country&#8217;s biological diversity. In 1997, the government established the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources. A general environmental framework law was approved by the National Assembly in 1999. Several non-governmental organizations are doing work to safeguard some of the country&#8217;s most important forested areas. Foremost among these is SalvaNatura, which manages El Impossible, the country&#8217;s largest national park under an agreement with El Salvador&#8217;s environmental authorities.<br \/>\nEl Salvador is home to six terrestrial ecosystems:\u00a0Central American montane forests,\u00a0Sierra Madre de Chiapas moist forests,\u00a0Central American dry forests,\u00a0Central American pine-oak forests,\u00a0Gulf of Fonseca mangroves, and\u00a0Northern Dry Pacific Coast mangroves.[84]\u00a0It had a 2018\u00a0Forest Landscape Integrity Index\u00a0mean score of 4.05\/10, ranking it 136th globally out of 172 countries.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Politics. <\/strong>El Salvador has a\u00a0multi-party system. Two\u00a0political parties, the\u00a0Nationalist Republican Alliance\u00a0(ARENA) and the\u00a0Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front\u00a0(FMLN) have tended to dominate elections. ARENA candidates won four consecutive presidential elections until the election of\u00a0Mauricio Funes\u00a0of the FMLN in March 2009. The FMLN Party is leftist in ideology, and is split between the dominant\u00a0Marxist-Leninist\u00a0faction in the legislature, and the\u00a0social liberal\u00a0wing led by Mauricio Funes until 2014. However, the two-party dominance was broken after\u00a0Nayib Bukele, a candidate from\u00a0GANA\u00a0won the\u00a02019 Salvadoran presidential election.\u00a0In February 2021, the results of\u00a0legislative election\u00a0caused a major change in the politics of El Salvador. The new allied party of president Nayib Bukele,\u00a0Nuevas Ideas\u00a0(New Ideas) won the biggest congressional majority in the country&#8217;s history.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>HUMAN RIGHTS<br \/>\n<\/strong>Amnesty International\u00a0has drawn attention to several arrests of police officers for unlawful police killings. Other issues to gain Amnesty International&#8217;s attention include missing children, failure of law enforcement to properly investigate and prosecute crimes against women, and rendering\u00a0organized labour\u00a0illegal.\u00a0Discrimination against\u00a0LGBT people\u00a0in El Salvador is very widespread.\u00a0According to 2013 survey by the\u00a0Pew Research Center, 62% of Salvadorans believe that\u00a0homosexuality\u00a0should not be accepted by society.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ECONOMY<br \/>\n<\/strong>El Salvador&#8217;s economy has been hampered at times by natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes, by government policies that mandate large economic subsidies, and by official corruption. Subsidies became such a problem that in April 2012, the International Monetary Fund suspended a $750\u00a0million loan to the central government. President Funes&#8217; chief of cabinet, Alex Segovia, acknowledged that the economy was at the &#8220;point of collapse&#8221;.<br \/>\nGross domestic product (GDP) in\u00a0purchasing power parity\u00a0estimate for 2021 is US$57.95\u00a0billion growing real GDP at 4.2% for 2021.\u00a0The service sector is the largest component of GDP at 64.1%, followed by the industrial sector at 24.7% (2008 est.) and agriculture represents 11.2% of GDP (2010 est.). The GDP grew after 1996 at an annual rate that averaged 3.2% real growth. The government committed to free market initiatives and the 2007 GDP&#8217;s real growth rate hit 4.7%.<br \/>\nIn December 1999, net international reserves equaled US$1.8\u00a0billion. Having this hard currency buffer to work with, the Salvadoran government undertook a monetary integration plan beginning in January 2001 by which the U.S. dollar became legal tender alongside the\u00a0Salvadoran col\u00f3n, and all formal accounting was done in U.S. dollars. With the adoption of the U.S. dollar, El Salvador lost control over monetary policy. Any counter-cyclical policy response to the downturn must be through fiscal policy, which is constrained by legislative requirements for a two-thirds majority to approve any international financing. As of December 2017, net\u00a0international reserves\u00a0stood at $3.57\u00a0billion.<br \/>\nIt has long been a challenge in El Salvador to develop new growth sectors for a more diversified economy. In the past, the country produced gold and silver,\u00a0but recent attempts to reopen the mining sector, which were expected to add hundreds of millions of dollars to the local economy, collapsed after President Saca shut down the operations of\u00a0Pacific Rim Mining Corporation. Nevertheless, according to the Central American Institute for Fiscal Studies (Instituto Centroamericano for Estudios Fiscales), the contribution of metallic mining was a minuscule 0.3% of the country&#8217;s GDP between 2010 and 2015.\u00a0Saca&#8217;s decision although not lacking political motives, had strong support from local residents and grassroots movements in the country. President Funes later rejected a company&#8217;s application for a further permit based on the risk of cyanide contamination on one of the country&#8217;s main rivers.<br \/>\nAs with other former colonies, El Salvador was considered a mono-export economy (an economy that depended heavily on one type of export) for many years. During colonial times, El Salvador was a thriving exporter of\u00a0indigo, but after the invention of synthetic dyes in the 19th century, the newly created modern state turned to\u00a0coffee\u00a0as the main export.<br \/>\nThe government has sought to improve the collection of its current revenues, with a focus on indirect taxes. A 10%\u00a0value-added tax\u00a0(IVA in Spanish), implemented in September 1992, was raised to 13% in July 1995. Inflation has been steady and among the lowest in the region. As a result of the free trade agreements, from 2000 to 2006, total exports have grown 19% from $2.94\u00a0billion to $3.51\u00a0billion, and total imports have risen 54% from $4.95\u00a0billion to $7.63\u00a0billion. This has resulted in a 102% increase in the trade deficit, from $2.01\u00a0billion to $4.12\u00a0billion.[105]<br \/>\nIn 2006, El Salvador was the first country to ratify the Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) \u2014 negotiated by the five countries of Central America and the\u00a0Dominican Republic\u00a0\u2014 with the United States. CAFTA requires that the Salvadoran government adopt policies that foster\u00a0free trade. CAFTA has bolstered exports of processed foods, sugar, and ethanol, and supported investment in the apparel sector, which faced Asian competition with the expiration of the\u00a0Multi Fibre Arrangement\u00a0in 2005. In anticipation of the declines in the apparel sector&#8217;s competitiveness, the previous administration sought to diversify the economy by promoting the country as a regional distribution and logistics hub, and by promoting tourism investment through tax incentives.<br \/>\nIn June 2021, President\u00a0Nayib Bukele\u00a0said he would introduce legislation to make\u00a0Bitcoin\u00a0legal tender\u00a0in El Salvador.\u00a0The\u00a0Bitcoin Law\u00a0was passed by the\u00a0Legislative Assembly of El Salvador\u00a0on 9 June 2021, with a majority vote of 62 out of 84. Bitcoin officially become a legal tender on 7 September 2021, ninety days after the publication of the law in the official gazette.\u00a0As part of the law foreigners can gain permanent residence in El Salvador if they invest 3 Bitcoin into the country.\u00a0The implementation of the law has been met with protests,\u00a0with the majority of the country being against using Bitcoin as legal tender.\u00a0According to a survery conducted by the Salvadaran Chamber of Commerce, as of March 2022 only 14% of merchants in the country processed at least one Bitcoin transaction.<br \/>\n<strong>Remittances from abroad<\/strong><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Exports to<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Imports from<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Country<\/td>\n<td>%<\/td>\n<td>Country<\/td>\n<td>%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>United States<\/td>\n<td>66%<\/td>\n<td>United States<\/td>\n<td>43.4%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Caribbean region<\/td>\n<td>26%<\/td>\n<td>Guatemala<\/td>\n<td>8.2%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mexico<\/td>\n<td>1%<\/td>\n<td>Mexico<\/td>\n<td>7.8%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spain<\/td>\n<td>1%<\/td>\n<td>European Union<\/td>\n<td>7.0%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Others<\/td>\n<td>6%<\/td>\n<td>Others<\/td>\n<td>33.6%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>El Salvador leads the region in\u00a0remittances\u00a0per capita, with inflows equivalent to nearly all export income; in 2019 2.35 million Salvadorans lived in the U.S.\u00a0and about a third of all households received remittances. Remittances from Salvadorans living in the United States, sent to family members in El Salvador, are a major source of foreign income and offset the trade deficit. Remittances have increased steadily since the early 2000s, growing from $3.32\u00a0billion, or approximately 16.2% of GDP in 2006,\u00a0to nearly $6 billion (around 20% of GDP in 2019, one of the highest rates in the world, according to the World Bank.)<br \/>\nRemittances have had positive and negative effects on El Salvador. In 2005, the number of people living in\u00a0extreme poverty\u00a0in El Salvador was 20%,\u00a0according to a United Nations Development Program report. While Salvadoran education levels have gone up, wage expectations have risen faster than productivity. This has led to an influx of Hondurans and Nicaraguans who are willing to work for the prevailing wage. Also, the local propensity for consumption has increased. Money from remittances has increased prices for certain commodities such as real estate. With much higher wages, many Salvadorans abroad can afford higher prices for houses in El Salvador and thus push up the prices that all Salvadorans must pay.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ENERGY<br \/>\n<\/strong>The largest wind park in the Central American region is located in Metapan, El Salvador<br \/>\nEl Salvador&#8217;s\u00a0energy\u00a0industry is diversified across\u00a0fossil fuels,\u00a0hydro, other\u00a0renewables\u00a0(mainly\u00a0geothermal) for local electricity production, along with a reliance on imports for\u00a0oil. El Salvador has an installed capacity of 1,983\u00a0MW\u00a0generating 5,830\u00a0GWh\u00a0of\u00a0electricity\u00a0per year, 84% of this comes from renewable sources including 26.85% from geothermal (produced from the country&#8217;s many\u00a0volcanoes), 29.92% from hydro and the rest is from fossil fuels.<br \/>\nAccording to the National Energy Commission, 94.4% of total injections during January 2021 came from hydroelectric plants (28.5% &#8211; 124.43 GWh), geothermal (27.3% &#8211; 119.07 GWh), biomass (24.4% 106.43 GWh), photovoltaic solar (10.6% &#8211; 46.44 GWh) and wind (3.6% &#8211; 15.67 GWh).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Official corruption and foreign investment.<br \/>\n<\/strong>In an analysis of ARENA&#8217;s electoral defeat in 2009, the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador pointed to official corruption under the Saca administration as a significant reason for public rejection of continued ARENA government. According to a secret diplomatic cable made public by WikiLeaks, &#8220;While the Salvadoran public may be inured to self-serving behaviour by politicians, many in ARENA believe that the brazen manner in which Saca and his people are widely perceived to have used their positions for personal enrichment went beyond the pale. ARENA deputy Roberto d&#8217;Aubuisson, son of ARENA founder\u00a0Roberto d&#8217;Aubuisson, told [a U.S. diplomat] that Saca &#8216;deliberately ignored&#8217; his Public Works Minister&#8217;s government contract kickbacks scheme, even after the case was revealed in the press. Furthermore, considerable evidence exists, including from U.S. business sources, that the Saca administration pushed laws and selectively enforced regulations with the specific intent to benefit Saca family business interests.&#8221;<br \/>\nSubsequent policies under Funes administrations improved El Salvador to foreign investment, and the World Bank in 2014 rated El Salvador 109, a little better than Belize (118) and Nicaragua (119) in the World Bank&#8217;s annual &#8220;Ease of doing business&#8221; index.<br \/>\nAs per Santander Trade, a Spanish think tank in foreign investment, &#8220;Foreign investment into El Salvador has been steadily growing during the last few years. In 2013, the influx of FDI increased. Nevertheless, El Salvador receives less FDI than other countries of Central America. The government has made little progress in terms of improving the business climate. In addition to this, the limited size of its domestic market, weak infrastructures and institutions, as well as the high level of criminality have been real obstacles to investors. However, El Salvador is the second most &#8220;business friendly&#8221; country in South America in terms of business taxation. It also has a young and skilled labour force and a strategic geographical position. The country&#8217;s membership in the DR-CAFTA, as well as its reinforced integration to the C4 countries (producers of cotton) should lead to an increase of FDI.&#8221;<br \/>\nForeign companies have lately resorted to arbitration in international trade tribunals in total disagreement with Salvadoran government policies. In 2008, El Salvador sought international arbitration against Italy&#8217;s Enel Green Power, on behalf of Salvadoran state-owned electric companies for a geothermal project Enel had invested in. Four years later, Enel indicated it would seek arbitration against El Salvador, blaming the government for technical problems that prevent it from completing its investment.\u00a0The government came to its defence claiming that Art 109 of the constitution does not allow any government (regardless of the party they belong), to privatize the resources of the national soil (in this case geothermic energy). The dispute came to an end in December 2014 when both parties came to a settlement, from which no details have been released. The small country had yielded to pressure from the Washington-based powerful\u00a0ICSID.\u00a0The U.S. Embassy warned in 2009 that the Salvadoran government&#8217;s populist policies of mandating artificially low electricity prices were damaging private sector profitability, including the interests of American investors in the energy sector.\u00a0The U.S. Embassy noted the corruption of El Salvador&#8217;s judicial system and quietly urged American businesses to include &#8220;arbitration clauses, preferably with a foreign venue&#8221;, when doing business in the country.<br \/>\nA 2008 report by the\u00a0United Nations Conference on Trade and Development\u00a0indicates that one third of the generation of electricity in El Salvador was publicly owned while two thirds was in American hands and other foreign ownership.<br \/>\nIn terms of how people perceived the levels of public corruption in 2014, El Salvador ranks 80 out of 175 countries as per the Corruption Perception Index.\u00a0El Salvador&#8217;s rating compares relatively well with Panama (94 of 175) and Costa Rica (47 of 175).<\/p>\n<p><strong>TOURISM<br \/>\n<\/strong>It was estimated that 1,394,000 international tourists visited El Salvador in 2014. Tourism contributed US$2970.1\u00a0million to El Salvador&#8217;s GDP in 2019. This represented 11% of total GDP.\u00a0Tourism directly supported 80,500 jobs in 2013. This represented 3.1% of total employment in El Salvador. In 2019, tourism indirectly supported 317,200 jobs, representing 11.6% of total employment in El Salvador.<br \/>\nMost North American and European tourists seek out El Salvador&#8217;s beaches and nightlife. El Salvador&#8217;s tourism landscape is slightly different from those of other Central American countries. Because of its geographic size and urbanization there are not many nature-themed tourist destinations such as ecotours or archaeological sites open to the public. According to the Salvadoran newspaper\u00a0El Diario De Hoy, the top 10 attractions are: the coastal beaches,\u00a0La Libertad, Ruta Las Flores,\u00a0Suchitoto, Playa Las Flores in\u00a0San Miguel, La Palma,\u00a0Santa Ana\u00a0(location of the country&#8217;s highest volcano),\u00a0Nahuizalco,\u00a0Apaneca,\u00a0Juayua, and\u00a0San Ignacio.<br \/>\nSurfing is a natural tourism sector that has gained popularity in recent years as Salvadoran beaches have become increasingly popular. Surfers visit many beaches on the coast of La Libertad and the east end of El Salvador. The use of the U.S. dollar as Salvadoran currency and direct flights of 4 to 6 hours from most cities in the United States are factors that attract American tourists. Urbanization and\u00a0Americanization\u00a0of Salvadoran culture has led to the abundance of American-style malls, stores, and restaurants in the three main urban areas, especially greater San Salvador.<\/p>\n<p><strong>INFRASTRUCTURE<br \/>\n<\/strong>The level of access\u00a0to water supply and sanitation\u00a0has been increased significantly. A 2015 conducted study by the University of North Carolina called El Salvador the country that has achieved the greatest progress in the world in terms of increased access to water supply and sanitation and the reduction of inequity in access between urban and rural areas.\u00a0However, water resources are seriously polluted and a large part of the wastewater discharged into the environment without any treatment. Institutionally a single public institution is both de facto in charge of setting sector policy and of being the main service provider. Attempts at reforming and modernizing the sector through new laws have not borne fruit over the past 20 years.<br \/>\nIn response to the\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0pandemic, the government converted the country&#8217;s main convention center into\u00a0Hospital El Salvador\u00a0to be the largest hospital in\u00a0Latin America. The facility was inaugurated by the president on 22 June 2020, at which time he announced the hospital conversion would be permanent because of the large investment made\u00a0US$25\u00a0million was spent on the first phase of the conversion of the former convention center,\u00a0with the entire facility costing $75\u00a0million and featuring a blood bank, morgue, radiology area, among other amenities.\u00a0The hospital will have a total capacity of 1,083 ICU beds and 2,000 beds total once phase 3 is completed.<br \/>\nThe airport serving international flights in El Salvador is\u00a0Monse\u00f1or \u00d3scar Arnulfo Romero International Airport. This airport is located about 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) southeast of San Salvador<\/p>\n<p><strong>DEMOGRAPHICS<br \/>\n<\/strong>El Salvador&#8217;s population was 6,420,746 in 2018,\u00a0compared to 2,200,000 in 1950. In 2010 the percentage of the population below the age of 15 was 32.1%, 61% were between 15 and 65 years of age, while 6.9% were 65 years or older.\u00a0The capital city of San Salvador has a population of about 2.1\u00a0million people. An estimated 42% of El Salvador&#8217;s population live in rural areas.\u00a0Urbanization\u00a0has expanded at a phenomenal rate in El Salvador since the 1960s, with millions moving to the cities and creating associated problems for urban planning and services.<br \/>\nThere are up to 100,000 Nicaraguans living in El Salvador.<br \/>\nEthnic groups. Mestizo 86.3, White 12.7%, Indigenous .23%, Black .13%, other .64%. 12.7% of Salvadorans report as\u00a0White, mostly of ethnically\u00a0Spanish people, while there are also Salvadorans of\u00a0French,\u00a0German,\u00a0Swiss,\u00a0English,\u00a0Irish, and\u00a0Italian\u00a0descent. Most Central European immigrants in El Salvador arrived during\u00a0World War II\u00a0as refugees from the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Switzerland. There are also small communities of Jews, Palestinian Christians, and Arab Muslims (in particular\u00a0Palestinians).<br \/>\n0.23% of the population report as fully indigenous. The ethnic groups are Kakawira which represents 0.07% of the total country&#8217;s population,\u00a0Nawat\u00a0(0.06%),\u00a0Lenca\u00a0(0.04%) and other minor groups (0.06%). Very few Amerindians have retained their customs and traditions, having over time assimilated into the dominant mestizo culture.\u00a0There is a small\u00a0Afro-Salvadoran\u00a0group that is 0.13% of the total population, with Blacks, among other races, having been prevented from immigrating via government policies in the early 20th century.\u00a0The descendants of enslaved Africans, however, had already integrated into the Salvadoran population and culture well before, during the colonial and post-colonial period.<br \/>\nAmong the immigrant groups in El Salvador, Palestinian Christians stand out.\u00a0Though few in number, their descendants have attained great economic and political power in the country, as evidenced by the election of President\u00a0Antonio Saca, whose opponent in the 2004 election,\u00a0Schafik Handal, was also of Palestinian descent, and the flourishing commercial, industrial, and construction firms owned by this ethnic group.<br \/>\nAs of 2004, there were approximately 3.2\u00a0million Salvadorans living outside El Salvador, with the United States traditionally being the destination of choice for Salvadoran economic migrants. By 2012, there were about 2.0\u00a0million Salvadoran immigrants and\u00a0Americans of Salvadoran descent\u00a0in the U.S.,\u00a0making them the sixth largest immigrant group in the country.\u00a0The second destination of Salvadorans living outside is Guatemala, with more than 111,000 persons, mainly in\u00a0Guatemala City. Salvadorans also live in other nearby countries such as Belize, Honduras and Nicaragua.\u00a0Other countries with notable Salvadoran communities include Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom (including the Cayman Islands), Sweden, Brazil, Italy, Colombia, and Australia.<br \/>\n<strong>Languages. <\/strong>Castillian, also known as Spanish, is the official language and is spoken by virtually all inhabitants, although a very small number (around 500) of indigenous\u00a0Pipils\u00a0speak\u00a0Nawat. The other indigenous languages, namely\u00a0Poqomam,\u00a0Cacaopera, and\u00a0Lenca\u00a0are extinct.\u00a0Q&#8217;eqchi&#8217;\u00a0is spoken by indigenous immigrants of\u00a0Guatemalan\u00a0and\u00a0Belizean\u00a0origin living in El Salvador.<br \/>\nThe local Spanish\u00a0vernacular\u00a0is called\u00a0Caliche,\u00a0which is considered informal. Like other regions of Central and South America, Salvadoran use\u00a0voseo. This refers to the use of &#8220;vos&#8221; as the second person pronoun, instead of &#8220;t\u00fa&#8221;.<br \/>\n<strong>Religion.<\/strong> The majority of the population in El Salvador is\u00a0Christian.\u00a0Roman Catholics\u00a0(47%) and\u00a0Protestants\u00a0(33%) are the two major religious groups in the country. Those not affiliated with any religious group amount to 17% of the population.\u00a0The remainder of the population (3%) is made up of\u00a0Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses,\u00a0Hare Krishnas,\u00a0Muslims,\u00a0Jews,\u00a0Buddhists,\u00a0Latter-day Saints, and those adhering to indigenous religious beliefs.\u00a0The number of evangelicals in the country is growing rapidly.\u00a0\u00d3scar Romero, the first Salvadoran saint, was canonized by\u00a0Pope Francis\u00a0on 14 October 2018.<br \/>\n<strong>Education.<\/strong> The public education system in El Salvador is severely lacking in resources. Class sizes in public schools can be as large as 50 children per classroom. Salvadorans who can afford the cost often choose to send their children to private schools, which are regarded as being better-quality than public schools. Most private schools follow American, European or other advanced systems. Lower-income families are forced to rely on public education.<br \/>\nEl Salvador was ranked 96th in the\u00a0Global Innovation Index\u00a0in 2021, up from 108th in 2019.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Crime.<\/strong> Since the early twenty-first century, El Salvador has experienced high crime rates, including gang-related crimes and\u00a0juvenile delinquency.\u00a0El Salvador had the highest murder rate in the world in 2012 but experienced a sharp decline in 2019 with a new centrist government in power.\u00a0It is also considered an epicentre of a gang crisis, along with Guatemala and Honduras.\u00a0Several journalistic investigations indicate that the government administrations of Carlos Mauricio Funes Cartagena\u00a0and Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n,\u00a0far from working to eradicate violence and the actions of gang groups, made truces with the gangs Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha\u00a0to keep a certain control over criminal activities and murders in the Salvadoran territory. In response to this, the government has set up countless programs to try to guide the youth away from gang membership; so far its efforts have not produced any quick results. One of the government programs was a gang reform called &#8220;Super Mano Dura&#8221; (Super Firm Hand). Super Mano Dura had little success and was highly criticized by the United Nations. It experienced temporary success in 2004 but there was a rise in crime after 2005. In 2004, there were 41 intentional homicides per 100,000 citizens, with 60% of the homicides committed being gang-related.\u00a0In 2012, the homicide rate had increased to 66 per 100,000 inhabitants, more than triple the rate in Mexico.\u00a0There are an estimated 25,000 gang members at large in El Salvador with another 9,000 in prison.\u00a0The most well-known gangs, called &#8220;maras&#8221; in colloquial Spanish, are\u00a0Mara Salvatrucha\u00a0and their rivals\u00a0Barrio 18. Maras are hunted by\u00a0death squads\u00a0including\u00a0Sombra Negra. New rivals also include the rising mara, The Rebels 13.<br \/>\nAs of March\u00a02012, El Salvador has seen a 40% drop in crime due to what the Salvadoran government called a gang truce; however, extortion affecting small businesses are not taken into account. In early 2012, there were an average of 16 killings per day; in late March of that year that number dropped to fewer than 5 per day. On 14 April 2012 for the first time in over 3 years there were no killings in El Salvador.\u00a0Overall, there were 411 killings in January 2012, and in March the number was 188, more than a 40% reduction,\u00a0while crime in neighbouring Honduras had risen to an all-time high.\u00a0In 2014, crime rose 56% in El Salvador, with the government attributing the rise to a break in the truce between the two major gangs in El Salvador, which began having turf wars.<br \/>\nThe year 2015 is considered the most violent in El Salvador in the postwar period. With a total of 6,650 homicides (23 murders per day).\u00a0Since that year the figures have been drastically decreasing until reaching 2021. During 2016\u00a0at least 5,728 people were murdered (15.69 murders per day). El Salvador finished the 2017 with an average of 11 homicides per day (3,962\u00a0murders). In 2018 there was a decrease of 616 murders in relation to 2017. The year closed with 3,348 deaths (9.19 murders per day). Coming up to 2019.\u00a0Authorities reported a total of 2,365 homicides (6.47 murders per day).<br \/>\nHomicides kept decreasing in 2020 (3.63 of murders per day, 1,322 homicides\u00a0which accounts about half of the murders occurred in 2019. By 2021 the country recorded 1,140 homicides (3.12 murders per day. That year had the lowest number recorded since the end of the civil war in 1992, according to official data.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CULTURE<br \/>\n<\/strong>Pulling from indigenous, colonial Spanish and African influences, a composite population was formed as a result of intermarrying between the natives, European settlers, and enslaved Africans. The Catholic Church plays an important role in the Salvadoran culture. Archbishop\u00a0\u00d3scar Romero\u00a0is a national hero for his role in resisting human rights violations that were occurring in the lead-up to the Salvadoran Civil War.\u00a0Significant foreign personalities in El Salvador were the Jesuit priests and professors\u00a0Ignacio Ellacur\u00eda,\u00a0Ignacio Mart\u00edn-Bar\u00f3, and\u00a0Segundo Montes, who were murdered in 1989 by the Salvadoran Army during the height of the civil war.<br \/>\nPainting, ceramics and textiles are the principal manual artistic mediums.<br \/>\n<strong>Cuisine.<\/strong> One of El Salvador&#8217;s notable dishes is the\u00a0pupusa.\u00a0Pupusas\u00a0are handmade corn tortillas (made of\u00a0masa de ma\u00edz\u00a0or\u00a0masa de arroz, a maize or rice flour dough used in\u00a0Latin American cuisine) stuffed with one or more of the following: cheese (usually a soft Salvadoran cheese such as\u00a0quesillo, similar to mozzarella),\u00a0chicharr\u00f3n, or\u00a0refried beans. Sometimes the filling is\u00a0queso con loroco\u00a0(cheese combined with\u00a0loroco, a vine flower bud native to Central America).\u00a0Pupusas revueltas\u00a0are\u00a0pupusas\u00a0filled with beans, cheese and pork. There are also vegetarian options. Some adventurous restaurants even offer\u00a0pupusas\u00a0stuffed with shrimp or spinach. The name\u00a0pupusa\u00a0comes from the Pipil-Nahuatl word,\u00a0pupushahua. The origins of the\u00a0pupusa\u00a0are debated, although its presence in El Salvador is known to predate the arrival of the Spaniards.<br \/>\nIn El Salvador, the pupusa is considered a Mesoamerican ancestral legacy and the most popular dish nationally.<br \/>\nYuca frita\u00a0is deep fried\u00a0cassava\u00a0root served with\u00a0curtido\u00a0(a pickled cabbage, onion and carrot topping) and pork rinds with\u00a0pescaditas\u00a0(fried baby sardines). Yuca is sometimes served boiled instead of fried.<br \/>\nPanes con pollo\/pavo\u00a0(bread with chicken\/turkey) are warm turkey or chicken-filled submarine sandwiches. The bird is marinated and then roasted with spices and hand-pulled. This sandwich is traditionally served with tomato and watercress along with cucumber, onion, lettuce, mayonnaise, and mustard.<br \/>\nFried plantain, usually served with cream is a common breakfast. It is common in Salvadoran restaurants and homes, including those of immigrants to the United States.<br \/>\nAlguashte, a condiment made from dried, ground\u00a0pepitas, is commonly incorporated into savoury and sweet Salvadoran dishes.<br \/>\n&#8220;Maria Luisa&#8221; is a dessert commonly found in El Salvador. It is a layered cake that is soaked in orange marmalade and sprinkled with powdered sugar.<br \/>\nPastel de tres leches\u00a0(Cake of three milks), consisting of three types of milk: evaporated milk, condensed milk, and cream.<br \/>\nA popular drink that Salvadorans enjoy is\u00a0horchata.\u00a0Horchata\u00a0is most commonly made of the\u00a0morro seed\u00a0ground into a powder and added to milk or water, and sugar.\u00a0Horchata\u00a0is drank year-round, and can be drank at any time of day. It mostly is accompanied by a plate of\u00a0pupusas\u00a0or fried yuca.\u00a0Horchata\u00a0from El Salvador has a very distinct taste and is not to be confused with Mexican\u00a0horchata, which is rice-based. Coffee is also a common morning beverage.\u00a0Other popular drinks in El Salvador include ensalada, a drink made of chopped fruit swimming in fruit juice, and\u00a0Kolachampan, a sugar cane-flavoured carbonated beverage.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Capital.
