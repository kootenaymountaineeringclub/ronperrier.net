Pressure from the weight of the ice slowly pushes the glacier over the inner fjord of Lake Argentino reaching the coast of Pen\u00ednsula de Magallanes and bisecting the lake at an area called the Brazo Rico (Rico Arm) on one side and the Canal de los T\u00e9mpanos (Iceberg Channel) on the other. With no outlet, the water level on the Brazo Rico side of the lake can rise by as much as 30 meters above the level of the main body of Argentino Lake. Intermittently, the pressure produced by the height of the dammed water breaks through the ice barrier causing a spectacular rupture, sending a massive outpouring of water from the Brazo Rico section to the main body of Lake Argentino and the Santa Cruz River. As the water exits Brazo Rico, the scored shoreline is exposed, showing evidence of the height of the water build-up. This dam\u2013ice-bridge\u2013rupture cycle recurs naturally between once a year to less than once every decade.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>The glacier advances between June and December and recedes between December and April. The formation of an ice barrier is a complex process, since there is a feedback mechanism between the glacier and the lake, which affects the oscillations of the position of the glacial front in a fairly stable way. The discharge of the water can be sudden, progressive or minor burst. In a sudden type event, the maximum discharge can reach 8000 m\u00b3 per second, while a smaller event only evacuates 123 m\u00b3. <sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_10-1\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>The ruptures occurred in the years, 1917, 1935, 1940, 1942, 1947, 1952, 1953, 1956, 1960, 1963, 1966, 1970, 1972, 1975, 1977, 1980, 1984, 1988, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2012, 2013 (two events, one in January and one in December), 2016, <sup id=\"cite_ref-:1_11-0\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>2018<sup id=\"cite_ref-:1_11-1\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>\u00a0and 2019.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Tourism.<\/strong> Due to its size and accessibility, Perito Moreno is one of the major tourist attractions and the rupture of this glacier is considered one of the most impressive natural spectacles in the world.

Tierra del Fuego is divided between Argentina on the eastern part of the main island and a few small islands in the Beagle Channel, and Chile, which controls the remaining land area. The southernmost extent of the archipelago is just north of latitude 56\u00b0S.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">The earliest known human settlement in Tierra del Fuego dates to approximately 8,000 BC. Europeans first explored the islands during Ferdinand Magellan&#8217;s expedition of 1520. Tierra del Fuego and similar namings stem from sightings of the many bonfires that the natives built.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\"><strong>Geography.<\/strong> The archipelago is divided by an east-west channel, the Beagle Channel, immediately south of the main island. The western part of the main island, and almost all the other islands, belong to Chile. The capital and chief town is Punta Arenas on the mainland across the strait.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">The eastern part of the main island and a few small islands in the Beagle Channel belong to Argentina. The capital is Ushuaia, the largest city of the archipelago. The Cordillera Darwin in the southwestern part of the main island contains many glaciers that reach the ocean.<br \/>\n<\/span><strong style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Climate<\/strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\"> is a subpolar oceanic climate with short, cool summers and long, wet, moderately mild winters: the precipitation averages 3,000 mm (118 in) a year in the far west, but precipitation decreases rapidly towards the eastern side. Temperatures are steady throughout the year: in Ushuaia, they hardly surpass 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) in summers and average 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) in winters. Snowfall can occur in summer. The cold and wet summers help preserve the ancient glaciers.<br \/>\n<\/span><strong style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Flora.<\/strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\"> Only 30% of the islands have forests, the only forests in the world to have developed in a climate with such cold summers. Winds are so strong that trees in wind-exposed areas grow into twisted shapes.<br \/>\n<\/span><strong style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Fauna<\/strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">. North American beavers, introduced during the 1940s, have proliferated and caused considerable damage to the island forests. The governments have established a wide-reaching program to trap and kill beavers in Tierra del Fuego.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">Whales include southern right whales, humpbacks, some blue whales, southern fins, southern seis, and southern minkes. Pinnipeds include South American sea lions, South American fur seals, the carnivorous and seal-eating leopard seals, and gigantic southern elephant seals \u2013 the largest extant marine mammal that is not a cetacean.<br \/>\n<\/span><strong style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Economy.<\/strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\"> Today, the main economic activities of the archipelago are fishing, extraction of natural gas and\u00a0oil,\u00a0sheep\u00a0farming, and\u00a0ecotourism.
