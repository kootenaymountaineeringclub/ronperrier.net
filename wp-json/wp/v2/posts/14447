Meaning &#8216;Mound of the Dead Men&#8221;, it is an archaeological site built around 2500 BCE. It was one of the largest settlements of the ancient\u00a0Indus Valley Civilisation, and one of the world&#8217;s earliest major\u00a0cities, contemporaneous with the civilizations of\u00a0ancient Egypt,\u00a0Mesopotamia,\u00a0Minoan Crete, and\u00a0Norte Chico. Mohenjo-daro was abandoned in the 19th century BCE as the Indus Valley Civilization declined, and the site was not rediscovered until the 1920s.<br \/>\nIt is situated on a\u00a0ridge in the middle of the floodplain of the Indus River Valley, around 28 kilometres (17\u00a0mi) from the town of\u00a0Larkana.\u00a0Subsequent flooding has since buried most of the ridge in silt deposits.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Harappan\u00a0Civilization spanned much of what is now Pakistan and North India, extending westwards to the\u00a0Iranian\u00a0border. Mohenjo-daro was the most advanced city of its time, with remarkably sophisticated civil engineering and urban planning. Mohenjo-daro has a\u00a0planned layout\u00a0with\u00a0rectilinear\u00a0buildings arranged on a\u00a0grid plan.\u00a0Most were built of fired and mortared\u00a0brick; some incorporated sun-dried\u00a0mud-brick\u00a0and wooden superstructures. A\u00a0&#8220;weak&#8221; estimate of a peak population is around 40,000.<br \/>\nThe Citadel \u2013 a mud-brick mound around 12 metres (39\u00a0ft) high \u2013 is known to have supported public baths, a large residential structure designed to house about 5,000 citizens, and two large assembly halls. The city had a central marketplace, with a large central well. Individual households or groups of households obtained their water from smaller wells. Wastewater was channeled to covered drains that lined the major streets. Some houses, presumably those of more prestigious inhabitants, include rooms that appear to have been set aside for bathing, and one building had an underground furnace (known as a\u00a0hypocaust), possibly for heated bathing. Most houses had inner courtyards, with doors that opened onto side-lanes. Some buildings had two stories.<br \/>\nMohenjo-daro had no series of city walls, was fortified with guard towers, it is postulated that Mohenjo-daro was an administrative center.<br \/>\n<span id=\"Water_supply_and_wells\"><\/span>Over 700 wells\u00a0 (one for every three houses) are present alongside drainage and bathing systems,\u00a0unheard of when compared to other civilizations at the time, such as Egypt or Mesopotamia. The circular brick well design is credited to the Indus civilization. Sewage and wastewater for buildings at the site were disposed of via a centralized drainage system that ran alongside the site&#8217;s streets emptying into the Indus River.<br \/>\nThe city could have been flooded and silted over, perhaps six times.<br \/>\nArtifacts.

Outstanding testament to Sindhi civilization between the 14th and 18th centuries.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Karez System Cultural Landscape.<\/strong> Tentative WHS (12\/04\/2016).\u00a0The Karez system of the Balochistan desert is an ancient and still functional community-based water management system in an arid landscape. Karez originated in the 1st millennium BC in Persia and travelled east and westward along the Silk Route, throughout the Muslim world arriving in China during the Han dynasty (206 BC \u2013 24 AD) and in Balochistan somewhat earlier. Used in India, western China, Middle East and North Africa.<br \/>\nKarez, its communities and their lands and pastures combine to form an organically evolved cultural landscape in a harsh environment.<br \/>\nKarez are constructed as a series of well-like vertical shafts, connected by sloping tunnels carrying large quantities of subterranean water by gravity and without need for pumping. The vertical shafts are for maintenance and water is used only when it emerges from the tunnels.\u00a0Karez allow water to be transported over long distances in hot dry climates without loss of much of the water to evaporation. The system is resistant to natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods, and to deliberate destruction in war. It is almost insensitive to the levels of precipitation, delivering a flow with only gradual variations from wet to dry years. A karez is environmentally sustainable as it has no additional energy requirement and, thus, has low life cycle operation and maintenance costs.<br \/>\nKarez are owned and maintained by the community who buy shares in it or \u201cshabanas\u201d, 24-hour cycles. A karez, depending upon its size, may have anywhere from 18 to 32 shabanas distributed between its shareholders, with individual claims ranging from the right to a few minutes to a week of water. A shareholder, or shareeq, is entitled to the standing of a country gentleman in the community and may sit in a jirga and weigh in on collective decisions. In this way the system of water access, distribution and use is closely linked to social structures and community identity. Although a karez system is expensive to construct, its long-term value to the community, and thereby to the group that invested in building and maintaining it, is substantial.<br \/>\nToday, though the system is under threat, there are approximately 1053 functioning karezes in Balochistan having more than 22,000 lps discharge, irrigating 27,000 ha in 2012. Another 270 karez are not functioning but could be restored to use. They are located in the northwest corner of Balochistan bordering with Afghanistan and Iran. A group of four representative karez is being proposed for inclusion on the Tentative List:<br \/>\n1. Spin Tangi Kareze, District Quetta<br \/>\n2. Chashma Achozai Kareze, District Quetta<br \/>\n3. Ulasi Kareze, District Pishin<br \/>\n4. Kandeel Kareze, Muslim Bagh, District Killa Saifullah<\/p>\n<p><strong>Nagarparkar Cultural Landscape.<\/strong> Tentative WHS (12\/04\/2016). Located at the southern limit of the vast Thar desert, where old stabilized sand dunes and the flat alluvial plain meet the marshy, tidal mudflats of the Runn of Kutch, and the Arabian Sea. Until as late as the 15th c. this area was covered by the Arabian Sea which extended northwards to the pink granite Karunjhar hills. Today these hills in the eastern part of the Runn surround the area of Nagarparkar and form the only raised, dry land in this dramatic locale. Areas to the west and east which were formally sea are now alluvial marshland and brackish ponds, part of the Runn of Kutch Wildlife Sanctuary and RAMSAR site.<br \/>\nThe Nagarparkar landscape was an important centre of Jain religion and culture for centuries. The Jains were maritime merchants and financial advisors to the Rajputs, the Mughals and the Sultans of Delhi. They dominated trade and commerce in the region through the port of Parinagar, believed to have been founded in the 5th c. BC. Traces of port facilities are still visible in the nearby village of Dotar, or Doo ptar meaning two landing places.<br \/>\nThe Karunjhar hills were a place of pilgrimage called Sardhara where there is a Jain temple of Mahadeve and a ritual pool. The hills contain many sacred spaces associated with Jain munis, followers of Lord Mahavira and Parsanatha, where Yogis and Jain munis prayed and practiced austerity.<br \/>\nThe wealth of the Jain community was reflected in the richness of their temples. The towns of Nagarparker, Gori, Viravah, Bodhesar, contain remains of numerous Jain temples dating from the 12th to 15th centuries which appear to be the high point of Jain culture. The Temple at <strong>Gori<\/strong> is an excellent example; built on a high platform and reached by a series of steps carved into the rock, it is made of huge stone slabs and grand columns expertly carved with objects of Jain worship. \u00a0The temple is built in the classical Jain style, with one main temple surrounded by 52 smaller shrines, each housing one or more images of Jain prophets. The interior of Gori temple was adorned with paintings of Jain religious imagery which are older than any other frescos in the Jain temples of North India. Apart from this fabulously carved temple, there is a cluster of three other temples at Bodhesar built in 1375 AD and 1449 AD. Two temples with corbelled domes are built of kanjur and redstone, and are finely carved. The third temple, which is raised on a platform, is believed to have been built by a Jain woman.<br \/>\nOther significant Jain temples and remains of religious institutional buildings and water tanks are found in the villages of Nagarparkar, including the outstanding \u201cbazaar\u201d temple, Bodhesar, Viaravah, Kasbo and Gori.<br \/>\nThe Jain influence declined due to the shifting of the sea. Originally the Nagarparkar area was on the edge of an open marine gulf which gradually turned into an estuary as silt was deposited by the Indus River system. This was augmented by major tectonic events which led to the westward migration of channels of the Indus and the transformation of the Rann of Kutch into saline mudflats and land locked the area of Nagarparkar.<br \/>\nThe changes in the coastline and trade routes caused the Jain population to decline significantly in the 19th century and the last remaining Jain community left the area in 1947 at Partition. The faith still thrives in Indian Rajasthan across the border and many of the temples there, all of them named Godiji Parshwanath, trace their ancestry to much earlier religious centres such as Gori in Nagarparkar.<br \/>\nIt illustrates the evolution of an important religious and commercial settlement of Jain maritime trade along the north coast of the Arabian Sea, from a thriving centre to collapse due to the forces of environmental change. The towns show an array of Jain religious architecture.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Port of Banbhore.<\/strong> Tentative WHS (30\/01\/2004)\u00a0is a city dating to the 1st century BCE located on the\u00a0N-5 National Highway, east of\u00a0Karachi, between\u00a0Dhabeji\u00a0and\u00a0Gharo. It dates back to the Scytho-Parthian era and was later controlled by Muslims from the 8th to the 13th century, after which it was abandoned. Remains of one of the earliest known mosques in the region dating back to 727 AD are still preserved in the city.<br \/>\nThree distinct periods:\u00a0Scytho-Parthian\u00a0(1st century BC to 2nd century AD)<br \/>\nHindu-Buddhist (2nd century AD to 8th century AD), and\u00a0early Islamic\u00a0(8th century AD to 13th century AD).\u00a0The city was gradually deserted after the 13th century due to change in the course of the\u00a0Indus.<br \/>\nArchaeology. The city consisted of an enclosed area surrounded by a stone and mud wall. The citadel was divided into eastern and western sections by a fortified stone wall in the center. The eastern part contains ruins of a mosque with an inscription dating to 727 AD, sixteen years after the conquest of Sindh, indicating the best-preserved example of the earliest mosques in the region.\u00a0Remains of houses, streets, and other buildings have been found both within and outside the citadel.\u00a0Contemporary stone buildings from the three periods are also uncovered in the area including a palatial stone building with semi-circular shape, a\u00a0Shiva\u00a0temple from the Hindu period, and a mosque. Three gateways to the citadel were also uncovered during excavations.<br \/>\nBhanbhore Port. Bhanbhore was a medieval port city deriving its wealth from imported ceramic and metal goods, an industrial sector, and trade. The city was strategically located at the mouth of the\u00a0Indus, linking it with rest of the\u00a0Indo-Scythians\u00a0and\u00a0Indo-Parthians\u00a0and international traders in the Indian Ocean. Archaeological findings show a half-submerged anchorage structure with solid stone foundation, which may have been used for berthing cargo boats. However, the port was abandoned when the Indus river shifted its position and the creek was silted.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rani Kot Fort,<\/strong> Dadu.

The famous ancient Hindu religious place is in a mountain cave on the bank of the Hingol River. It predates the Arab invasion and the advent of Sufism. The goddess Shaktior Sati, the female principal of Hinduism is worshipped. Hindus believe that the head of goddess Sati fell in the area of Hinglaj Mata when her body was dismembered by Vishnu and it has remained a revered pilgrimage site for Hindus. Local Muslims also revere the place, calling it Nani Mandar, and serve as custodians of the cave temple.<br \/>\nIt is the largest National Park of Pakistan with an area of 6,190km2. The park is named for the Hingol River which flows through it, forming an estuary as it enters the Arabian Sea. Hingol National Park contains a diverse range of landscapes from the depths of the Arabian Sea to the intertidal, beaches and the estuary of the Hingol River to the Dhrun Mountains with its highest point at 1,580 m. Large tracts of the park are covered with drift sand and can be classified as coastal semi desert with arid montane and rugged mud rock formations along the coast. These mud rock formations are a mass of east-west folds, created by the northward thrust of the Indian Ocean plate under the continental crust, characterized by deep and barren rocky gullies, steep cliffs and caves.<br \/>\nThe shrine is located in one of these natural caves on a stream leading to the Hingol River. There is no temple structure, just a low mud altar and a small stone worshipped as the goddess. Throughout the year, thousands of Hindus visit with 5,000 in the month of April<br \/>\nWorshippers also visit the mud volcanoes which are a special feature of the park. In the subduction zones and the Makran coastal area where three major tectonic plates \u2013 namely Eurasian, Arabian and Indian plates meet.

Since then the Cholistan area has been a stark and inhospitable desert environment at the edge of empires.<br \/>\nThe medieval forts are a dozen structures, some standing and some deteriorated and some dating from pre-Mughal times, but all restored and expanded from the 16th to 18th century by powerful local clans.\u00a0Derawar fort is the best surviving example. Other forts include (roughly from north to south) Meergarh, Jaangarh, Marotgarh, Maujgarh, Dingarh, Khangarh, Khairgarh, Bijnotgarh and Islamgarh, forming a network across the desert landscape to protect and enable the desert caravan routes; mercantile routes from central Asia to the heartland of the sub-continent and pilgrimage routes between Mecca and India.<br \/>\nDerawar fort was built in the 9th c. by a Rajput ruler of Bhatti clan. and from the 19th century, it was the desert abode of the Nawabs of Bahawalpur until the 1970s. The fort survived intact due to this constant occupation. The fort is a massive and visually stunning square structure built of clay bricks. The walls are 1500m long and up to thirty meters high. There are forty circular bastions, ten on each side, which stand 30 m high and are visible across the desert for many miles. Each is decorated with intricate patterns in cut brick work. There are remains of structures inside the fort, may richly decorated with tile and fresco work; the Moti or Pearl Mosque stands nearby and the cemetery of the Nawabs of Bahawalpur filled with ornate and elaborate graves.<br \/>\nDerawar and the other forts illustrate the variety of the forms found from square brick structures with circular corner bastions, to square walls completely faced with semi-circular towers, to rectangular and even hexagonal shaped enclosures with angle bastions and square enclosures within an outer wall with multiple bastions. All of these varied forms date from the 16th to late 18th centuries. All these forts are clustered within an area of only. 250 km N-S and 100 km E-W to the east of the historic cities of Bahawalpur and Yazman.<br \/>\nThe explanation for this group of fortifications across the flat sands of the Rohi is presumed to be access to water, protection and control of these important water resources and their relationship to the caravan routes across the desert. Derawar, for example, is located at a critical point in the desert where it is possible to access deep water deposits which are all that remains of the ancient Hakra River. As a result, for many centuries Derawar has been an essential stopping and watering point for all caravans entering the great desert on route to trading entrepots to the east.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tomb of Bibi Jawindi, Baha&#8217;al-Halim and Ustead and the Tomb and Mosque of Jalaluddin Bukhari.<\/strong> Tentative WHS (30\/01\/2004).\u00a0This consists of 5 monuments at the South-West corner of Uch Sharif- representing the town\u2019s most exceptional architecture. The oldest are the fourteenth century AD tomb and mosque of the Central Asian Sufi Jalaluddin Bukhari. The brick-built tomb measures 18 x 24 meters, its carved wooden pillars support a flat roof and it is decorated with glazed tiles in floral and geometric designs. The ceiling is painted with floral designs in lacquer and its floor covered with the graves of the saint and his relatives an interior partition provides purdah for those of his womenfolk. Its mosque consists of a hall, measuring 20 meters by 11 meters, with 18 wooden pillars supporting a flat roof. It was built of cut and dressed bricks and further decorated, internally and externally, with enamelled tiles in floral and geometric designs. These structures were joined by a series of domed tombs; the first is said to have been built for Baha\u2019 al-Halim by his pupil, the Suharwardiya Sufi saint Jahaniyan Jahangasht (1307-1383 AD), the second for the latter\u2019s great grant daughter, Bibi Jalwindi, in c.1494 and the third for the latter\u2019s architect. They all have three tiers, an octagonal base supporting a zone of transition surmounted by a dome and are richly decorated with carved timber, cut and moulded brick, and blue and white faience mosaic tiles. The basement walls taper and are supported by 8 engaged tapering corner towers. The eroded nature of the three clearly allows their profile, construction and decorated interiors to be seen.<br \/>\n<strong>Derawar Fort<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Lal Suhanra NP<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Cities of Asia and Oceania<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong><strong>BUREWALA<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>KHANEWAL<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>SAHIWAL<\/strong><strong><em><br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong><strong>BAHAWALPUR\u00a0<\/strong>(pop 763,000).

The ancient city was site of the renowned\u00a0Multan Sun Temple, and was besieged by\u00a0Alexander the Great\u00a0during the\u00a0Mallian Campaign.\u00a0Multan was one of the most important trading centres of medieval Islamic India,\u00a0and attracted a multitude of\u00a0Sufi\u00a0mystics in the 11th and 12th centuries, earning the city the sobriquet\u00a0City of Saints.

The special features in the construction of the Shrine are the tapering walls, horizontal wooden beam embedded at the exterior of brick work and a wooden frame built with horizontal and vertical beams.\u00a0 The carved wooden Mehrab is a delicate and intricate piece of work, which is the earliest specimen of its kind in the whole South Asian subcontinent. The structure is built entirely in red brick, the whole exterior elaborately decorated with glazed tile panels in string-courses and merlons. The colours used are Indian blue, persian blue and white, which contrast with the red of the finely dressed bricks. The enamelled tiles have relief patterns, raised from half an inch to two inches from the background. The octagonal second storey is elaborately decorated with geometric, floral and arabesque designs. It is further beautified by calligraphic motifs, brick design in relief pattern of caustic tiles and ornamental brick work.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tomb of Shah Rukn-e-Alam.<\/strong> Tentative WHS (30\/01\/2004).
