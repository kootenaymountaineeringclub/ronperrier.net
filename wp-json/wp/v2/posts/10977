The adjacent\u00a0Trenta\u00a0Valley in the northwest leads into\u00a0Triglav National Park.<br \/>\n<strong>History.<\/strong> In ancient times, the area was on the\u00a0Roman road\u00a0leading up to the\u00a0Predil Pass. It was under the Hapsburgs after 1509, the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy after 1754 and\u00a0Austrian\u00a0rule until 1918.\u00a0Slovene completely replaced German as the language of everyday communication in the 19th century.\u00a0<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>During the last\u00a0Austro-Hungarian\u00a0period, two fortresses were erected along the Predil Pass road, the well-preserved Klu\u017ee\u00a0in 1881\u201382 and the ruined\u00a0Fort Hermann.<br \/>\nDuring\u00a0WWI, the area was the theatre of the bloody\u00a0Battles of the Isonzo, fought between Austro-Hungarian forces and the Italian Army between June 1915 and November 1917, which devastated the region almost completely. Over 600 soldiers are buried in the cemetery.\u00a0<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>Upon the 1918\u00a0Battle of Vittorio Veneto, Bovec was occupied by Italian forces and part of the\u00a0Kingdom of Italy. Under the\u00a0Italian Fascist\u00a0regime between 1922 and 1943, the Slovene-speaking population of Bovec and the neighbouring villages was submitted to a policy of forced\u00a0Italianization. Numerous locals, in turn, joined the underground militant anti-fascist\u00a0TIGR\u00a0organization, while many others emigrated to the neighbouring\u00a0Kingdom of Yugoslavia.<br \/>\n<span id=\"World_War_II\" class=\"mw-headline\">During World War II, b<\/span>etween 1943 and 1945, the area was occupied by\u00a0Nazi German\u00a0forces, and units of\u00a0Slovene partisans\u00a0were active in the area. After liberation,\u00a0Bovec came under joint British-U.S. occupation. Bovec is the site of a\u00a0mass grave with\u00a011 German soldiers killed between 1941 and 1945. The grave was exhumed in 2000 and the remains were transferred to\u00a0\u017dale Cemetery\u00a0in Ljubljana.<br \/>\nIn September 1947, the Paris Peace Treaties gave the town to Yugoslavia in 1951 and with the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991, Bovec became part of independent Slovenia.<br \/>\n<strong>Economy.<\/strong> It largely depends on\u00a0tourism.

A Roman fort and then a 15th-century Venetian fort preceded a 1505 fort built by the Austro-Hungarians when it held the regional government. In 1797, the French burned it down (the French destroyed everything they encountered after stealing anything valuable). In 1881-82, the Austrians built the present small, stone fortress with many narrow arrow\/gun slits. Because of the advent of artillery, it was soon of little use and Fort Hermann with artillery was built above it in 1897-98. After WWII, it was abandoned, severely damaged in a 1982 earthquake and then rebuilt in 1987.

Signs indicated I was in <strong>Triglav National Park<\/strong>. The road climbed and after turning onto the road to <strong>Juliana Alpine Botanical Garden<\/strong>, I was in 4 inches of soft snow that had not been plowed. I was surprised at how well the van with all-season tires and AWD handled the conditions. At the gardens (well under snow), signs indicated that the road continued to climb and snow would be a problem! I wisely turned around but briefly reconsidered when the snowplow came up the hill. Not knowing how far he was going, that was a good decision as he came up here only after seeing my tracks as he then followed me down.<br \/>\nSo I had plan B and returned all the way to Kobarid to go south around the mountains.

The very narrow two-lane road was in a very narrow valley passing through many one-horse villages. With a thousand twists, turns and switchbacks, I was in 2<sup>nd<\/sup> gear as much as third. Then Google Maps got weird taking me on a narrow one-lane road with snow and I decided to ignore her for a while, got lost, repeated a 20km circuit and finally found the road going over a couple of snow-covered passes to Bled on the other side of the mountains. Temperatures reached a low of -2\u00b0C. Including an hour&#8217;s nap, it took me almost 4 hours to drive the 60 kilometres to Bled arriving well after dark. I parked right on the edge of Lake Bled on one of the darkest nights of the trip.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>As I have said many times before, I have a love\/hate relationship with Google Maps. Absolutely indispensable most of the time, it has 2 big problems: the algorithm likes short routes and you often find yourself in some back road (many speed bumps to almost 4WD) to save 10 metres. The other flaw is its instantaneous rerouting. If you miss a turn and are not looking at the screen, it reroutes so quickly, you may not realize it. She never says \u201cmake a U-turn\u201d, and then with the difficult scale, I have driven 40kms over mountain passes (around Cinque Terre in north Italy) to return to exactly where I was an hour before!!! As I am now aware of this, I try to park and see what is happening. She sounds so confident, I often forget she is a computer and can be wrong, sometimes disastrously. She also does not do well when offline. My present maps don\u2019t have a compass that I dearly miss.<\/em><br \/>\n<em>I don\u2019t think I will ever master how to use Google Maps most effectively.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Up early, I saw the following to wait till 10 am to see the museums in Bled.<br \/>\n<strong>Vintgar Gorge.<\/strong> Discovered in 1891, the gorge was impassable.\u00a0The 1.6 km long Vintgar gorge carves its way through the vertical rocks of the Hom and Bor\u0161t hills forming the Radovna waterfalls, pools and rapids.

A number of rises (Grad 599 m, Stra\u017ea 646 m, Kozarca 558 m, Osojnica 756 m, and Ravnica 729 m) separate the localities of Bled around the lake, the former villages of Grad, Mlino, Re\u010dica, Zagorice, and \u017dele\u010de.<br \/>\nBled lake is 2.12 kilometres long and 0.5 to 1 kilometre wide. In summer, the surface water reaches 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F) and is suitable for swimming. In colder winters it freezes and is used for ice skating. There is a thermal spring (23\u00a0\u00b0C or 73\u00a0\u00b0F) near the lake, next to the Bled Fault. Its water is used in indoor pools in two hotels.<br \/>\nToday&#8217;s town began to form in the mid-19th century from the villages of Grad, Mlino, Re\u010dica, Zagorice, and \u017dele\u010de, which were encircling the lake. At that time, farmers started to sell the land along the eastern lakeshore to wealthy individuals for their villas, and the villages of Grad, Zagorice, and \u017dele\u010de began to merge. Bled was officially recognized as a town in 1960.<br \/>\n<strong>Tourism.<\/strong> Bled is known for the\u00a0glacial\u00a0Lake Bled, which makes it a major tourist attraction. Perched on a rock overlooking the lake is the iconic\u00a0Bled Castle. The town is also known in Slovenia for its\u00a0vanilla and cream pastry. It became\u00a0a\u00a0health resort\u00a0in the second half of the 19th century. Due to its mild climate, Bled has been visited by aristocratic guests from all across the world. Today it is an important convention centre and tourist resort, offering a wide range of sports activities (golf,\u00a0fishing, and horseback riding).

It is the oldest mining town in Slovenia above the second-largest mercury ore deposit in the world (after Almaden in Spain). Mercury was first discovered here in 1490 &#8211; it is relatively rare, liquid at room temperature, 13x heavier than water and 2x heavier than iron. Long known as a polluter and health hazard, it has been replaced and most of the mines in the world have been closed, including these two. It was primarily used to amalgamate gold and silver from the 16th century in Central and South America. There are many sites in Idrija that show the mining heritage:<br \/>\nRead all about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2019\/03\/22\/mercury\/\">Mercury.<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Gewerkenegg Castle<\/strong>. The old mining office has the Idrija Municipal Museum. Besides the mining history and the history of the town, there is a large exhibit on lace making.<br \/>\n<strong>Anthony&#8217;s Main Road.<\/strong> This preserved mine entrance dating from the 16th century offers one-hour guided tours of the mine. It contains the Chapel of the Holy Trinity, now a museum. I took the guided tour \u20ac13, \u20ac10 reduced.<br \/>\nOn the excellent tour, I learned much more. Originally miners started their career at age 15-16 but were dead by age 35 because of silicosis of the lungs and\/or mercury poisoning. More recently the life expectancy was 60 because of improved conditions. Over the 500 years of operation, there were only 300 deaths due to mine accidents, a relatively low number. Mining techniques were exhibited at several stops: from originally working in the dark using a hammer and chisel to air-powered drills and finally to mechanical excavators. Of the original 700 km of tunnels, there are only about 5kms left. They have all been filled with water or rock. Backfilling tunnels and excavated areas was very important as the town was sinking from all the rock removed.<br \/>\nMercury occurs either as specific droplets of pure metal (easily visible) or as cinnabar, a combination of sulphur and mercury &#8211; the higher the concentration, the red the rock.<br \/>\nIn the smelter, the rock was crushed and then heated to 800\u00b0C and the mercury &#8220;boiled&#8221; off and collected as a distillate.<br \/>\n150,000 tons of mercury were produced over the lifetime of the mines here, with an average of about 240 tons\/year. The maximum in one year was 830 tons and production was always greatest during wartime as mercury was used to make bullets. As the need for mercury became almost nil, the mines here started to close in 1977 and all were shut down by 1987. There was thought to be at least another 40 years of production left.<br \/>\n<strong>Smelting plant.<\/strong> Presents the mercury extraction process.<br \/>\n<strong>Miner&#8217;s Street.<\/strong> 1870 miner&#8217;s housing.<br \/>\n<strong>Rake<\/strong>.

But it is a World Heritage Site because of the wonderful canyon and Reka River that flows through it. The river flows for 50 km above ground and then sinks into the karst underground before resurfacing again at Timavo Springs near the Gulf of Trieste.<br \/>\nThe cave is 7.5 km long and can only be seen on a guided tour. I took the Classic Tour at 10 am that visits 2.5 km of the cave. The walkways are all constructed concrete sidewalks. The cave was World Heritage listed in 1986 both for the river and the cultural remnants constructed by the first explorers from when the cave was first discovered in 1851 and into the early 1900s. Over 10kms of stairs, walkways and bridges were constructed and most are still intact.<br \/>\nWalk down a long gravel path to the 100m tunnel\/artificial entrance to the cave. The first half of the tour goes through the <em>Silent Cave<\/em>. It has some mediocre dripstone formations. The roof of this cave collapsed and destroyed or covered up the dripstone that had formed. High above the river, this section was discovered relatively late. The highlight is the 100m x 30m high Big Chamber with some dripstone curtains, terraces of travertine basins and crooked stalactites caused by the air currents in the cave.

There is nothing special about this place other than its location and view across the bay to Trieste and the Julian Alps in the distance.<br \/>\n<strong>St. George&#8217;s Church<\/strong>. Sitting on the edge of the water on the east side of the peninsula of Piran, its tall stone bell tower is the town landmark. The church is average with a plain white exterior and interior and the usual marble side altars, pillars and religious art. But there is a great statue of St George killing the dragon on the east wall. Sitting next to the bell tower is a nice hexagonal Baptistry.<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mutl i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/travelslovenia.org\/church-st-george-piran\/piran-church-st-george-view\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwjb-pXIsZnhAhUE_qQKHeCKDvwQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mut\" src=\"https:\/\/encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT0UR94-KJOGlBSoBzyrqO6zjPob1m9egxyDlnUXusBrVHZ50XH\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"530\" height=\"353\" data-iml=\"1553382719751\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Muzej Skoljk <\/strong>(Seashells Museum; the NM listing is the euphemistic Magical World of Seashells).
