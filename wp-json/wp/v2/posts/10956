This is another fortified medieval hilltop town visible for miles with its 14 high towers. Looking like a medieval Manhattan &#8211; there were originally 72 in a duel of tower one-upmanship. The 1348 plague wiped out much of the population leading to the town\u2019s submission to Florence in 1353. San Gimigano is famous for its Vernaccia wine.

It has a reputation for rich food (ragu or Bolognese sauce originated here), the learned, terracotta medieval buildings adorned with miles of porticoes and left-wing politics.<br \/>\n<strong>Bologna Welcome Card<\/strong> (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bolognawelcome.com\/en\">www.bolognawelcome.com\/en<\/a>) offers free museums for 48 hours.

I did go on the free city tour offered as part of the card and it was excellent. I even gave the guide a \u20ac5 tip. Buy the card at the Welcome Bologna tourist office in the main plaza. \u20ac25. For \u20ac40, add public transportation and the Torre Asinello.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nThe Porticoes of Bologna.\u00a0<\/strong>Rainy or snowy, sunny or windy days: with its almost 40 kilometres of porticos Bologna is a unique city in the world. These porticos make it easy to stroll around the city centre, go shopping or walk from one museum to another under a safe shelter away from both bad weather and the scorching sun.<br \/>\nPorticos have the same aim today as the one they had in the late Middle Ages when they were first built; the urban migration and the arrival of students and men of letters at the oldest University of the Western world caused an extraordinary growth of the city, and at that time Bologna had the same urban development as Paris. The origin of porticos is the\u00a0<i>sporto<\/i>, a protruding wooden structure that was usually built in order to extend the inner living space of the upper floors. These structures then grew bigger and heavier, so that it was necessary to prop them up with wooden beams which inevitably occupied the street. Today it is still possible to see some examples of these first porticos in the historical centre: the wooden portico of Isolani House (19, Strada Maggiore), the one of Palazzo Grassi (12, via Marsala) and the portico of the Reggiani \u2013 Seracchioli Houses (Piazza della Mercanzia).<br \/>\nThe streets were soon so crowded with porticos that the city council decided to lay down some official rules. While other cities had banned the portico, in Bologna it became compulsory as a public space. The 1288 Statutes established that all new houses should have a portico and set out the minimum measures, for example, the height should be 7 feet (about 2.70 m) in order to allow the passage of a man riding his horse. This act left an imprint on the final appearance of the city.<br \/>\nCraftsmen contributed to the spreading of the portico throughout the city: they were an outdoor workroom, sheltered both from the summer sun and the winter rain and a well-lit space if compared with the dark workshops on the ground floor of their houses. In this sense, the portico became an extension of the house and the workshop.<br \/>\n<strong>San Luca Portico.<\/strong> Bologna has the longest portico in the world, too: 3,796 metres. It\u2019s the portico starting just outside the city walls and leading to the Sanctuary of the Madonna di San Luca on the top of the Colle (hill) della Guardia.<br \/>\nThis sheltered walkway was built between 1674 and 1739 for the procession which has taken place every year since 1433, when citizens carry the painting of the Madonna with Child around the city. The portico was partly built thanks to donations made by the citizens, which are mentioned in special plaques along the way, as the Sanctuary with its Sacred Icon has been a place of pilgrimage since its origin (12<sup>th<\/sup>\u00a0century).<br \/>\nThis long portico begins with the Bonaccorsi Arch at Porta Saragozza where you can visit the Museum of the Madonna di San Luca; then, passing along Villa Spada, Villa delle Rose and Celebrazioni Theatre, you come to the Meloncello Arch, built in the Baroque style.<br \/>\nThe uphill climb begins at Meloncello (55 m. above sea level). The 2 kilometre spectacular stairway winds up to the Sanctuary (270 m. above sea level) along the via di San Luca and it\u2019s lined by 15 chapels representing the Mystery of the Rosary. The steepest climb begins at about halfway, soon after the sharp bend called\u00a0<i>delle Orfanelle<\/i>. Here, where a former female orphanage was, the street passes under the portico.<br \/>\nA lot of traditions are still linked to the San Luca Hill today, for example walking up to the Sanctuary if a prayer has been granted (for life-saving events, such as recoveries, but also for happy ending love stories, passed university exams, gambling wins, etc.). In the past, it was common practice to climb the hill on one\u2019s knees while praying.<br \/>\nNowadays jogging or riding a bike to the top of the hill has become a traditional sports activity. International bicycle, foot and motorcycle races often take place on the street running along the San Luca walkway.<br \/>\nThese round-arched passageways are everywhere \u2013 there are at least 6000 in the city. On the day I was there, an announcement was to be made if these were to be taken off the tentative list (01\/06\/2006) and added to the permanent list.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Piazza Maggiore Area.<\/em><\/strong> The main plaza has as its centerpiece the Basilica, a wonderful Neptune Fountain (the water comes out of the nymph\u2019s nipples).<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/dreamofitaly.com\/explore-italy\/bologna-emilia-romagna\/fountain-of-neptune-bologna-italy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwjF8JmZ1ofhAhUhneAKHWeoAbYQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/dreamofitaly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/bologna.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Neptune Fountain\" width=\"530\" height=\"353\" data-iml=\"1552774079815\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.expedia.com\/Fountain-Of-Neptune-Bologna.d6075194.Vacation-Attraction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwjvvt_w1YfhAhVuUN8KHTgSBJYQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/thumbnails.trvl-media.com\/mJwCcbCZZ54xZbE5Ey7RG66Md5k=\/768x432\/images.trvl-media.com\/media\/content\/shared\/images\/travelguides\/destination\/621\/Fountain-Of-Neptune-90729.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Neptune Fountain\" width=\"628\" height=\"353\" data-iml=\"1552773995540\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nthe Palazzo Communale (the city hall) and the Palazzo del Podesta that has the Welcome Bologna office, 1500 completely different rosettes on its columns and a whispering gallery.<br \/>\n<strong>Basilica di San Petronio.<\/strong> The world\u2019s 5<sup>th<\/sup> largest church (132m x 66m x 47m), work began in 1390 and the fa\u00e7ade is still not finished \u2013 the bottom is white marble and the top half is very rough brick.<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=i&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;ved=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcommons.wikimedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFile%3ABasilica_di_San_Petronio_-_Bologna.jpg&amp;psig=AOvVaw1RMePzJKGMj-zYCsA0qxQr&amp;ust=1552860528757450\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwiC3rbE1ofhAhWlUt8KHVeSCocQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/a\/a4\/Basilica_di_San_Petronio_-_Bologna.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Basilica di San Petronio.\" width=\"562\" height=\"353\" data-iml=\"1552774161131\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nA huge horizontal sundial stretches 67.7m down the eastern aisle (it discovered the anomalies of the Julian calendar and led to the creation of the leap year, although our guide denied this).

It has Renaissance palaces reborn as museums, a great Cathedral, a castle right off the main square and is second only to Lucca as having the most complete set of walls in Italy (at 9kms, Ferrara\u2019s are longer and are unbroken on the north and east). Ferrara is also the most bicycle-friendly town in Italy.<br \/>\n<strong>Sant&#8217;Antonio in Polesine.<\/strong> This monastery and church are on the south outskirts. The small, square building has a lovely fresco covering the entire ceiling.

The \u201cSweet Giant\u201d is the nickname for the Po River, as it divides into seven water tributaries before emptying into the Adriatic Sea. Its natural distribution gives life to a unique natural environment.<br \/>\nBy visiting the Delta, you will see landscapes made up of river basins, lakes, sandbanks and large rushes. Each branch of the river gives you a unique scene. The landscape is characterized at sunrise by a foggy haze, which provides for an enveloping atmosphere, while at sunset, red reflections are common.\u00a0 There are over 370 species of resident, migratory and migratory-stopover birds that make this area a desirable destination for bird watchers. There are many ways to visit the park: on-foot hikes, horse rides, boat tours, bike excursions.<br \/>\nPancake flat, the delta is prime agricultural land, full of fields and vineyards. Canals and dykes tame the river. I crossed at least four branches of the languid river heading north. The delta starts in Ferrara and extends 60 driving kilometres to the sea.<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/earthobservatory.nasa.gov\/images\/91832\/the-sculpting-of-ebro-delta\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwjxysPO4IfhAhVnhOAKHc1dAt0QjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov\/images\/imagerecords\/91000\/91832\/ebro_oli_2018031_th.jpg\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"530\" height=\"353\" data-iml=\"1552776870545\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<em>On the drive, I found the cheapest gas in Italy at \u20ac1,42.9 and the station had a car wash that was badly needed<\/em>.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Pomposa Abbey. <\/strong>A Benedictine Abbey was here in the 6<sup>th<\/sup>-7<sup>th<\/sup> centuries and the church was built between 751-874. The abbey became a centre of spirituality along with the Via Romeo that connected Rome with northwestern Europe. It reached its height of importance in the 11<sup>th<\/sup> century when a large cloister was built and frescoes were painted in the refectory, chapter house and Santa Maria church. In 1152, the Po River flooded, changing the hydrology of the entire area and was a disaster for the abbey. There were 100 monks at the time of the flood, 20 in 1235 and the last left in 1671 and the abbey was abolished two years later. Allowed to deteriorate, it was purchased for agricultural purposes in 1802.
