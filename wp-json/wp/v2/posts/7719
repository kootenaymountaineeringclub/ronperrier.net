Paul Allen and I climbed this major Badshots peak from a car camp on Gainer Creek. Details follow. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">From Trout Lake City, we drove the Lardeau Creek and Gainer roads to the very end just south of Bunker Hill Creek (2WD). <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">After camping in a cut block on the east side of Gainer, we got away at 6:25 am, starting from the road on the west bank (GR 791-165, 4300\u2019) and bushwhacking up a long, southwest-tending ridge on the south side of Bunker Hill. After two hours of thrashing (not bad by Badshot standards), we emerged onto talus slopes. These we followed as the ridge bent west. Soon the ridge became more defined and offered fine scrambling on good limestone. It was narrow with impressive exposure in places and the way ahead looked daunting, but the route kept unfolding in front of us. By 12:00, we had reached the ridge end and walked off talus slopes onto the Spine Glacier. We then plodded across the snow and up to the peak\u2019s south ridge, which we followed easily to the summit by 12:45 (6 hrs. 20 min. up). <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">During our 50 min. on top, we admired the stunning views (it\u2019s perhaps the best observation point in the area), read the original summit record by Ian Kay\u2019s party of 1950 (same route as ours), put in a new KMC summit record tube, and monitored the worsening weather (it had been sunny up). <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">On the descent, we re-traced our steps to the ridge and then bypassed the upper, craggy part by descending the glacier on the north (or left, on descent). We re-joined the ridge at the talus section just as the sprinkles began and continued through the moderately wet bush to the truck by 5:35 (4 hours down; 11 hr. 10 min. day). <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">As far as we know, this is the third ascent of the peak and the first as a weekday day trip. We took a 7 mm rope (which was not used), and bivvy gear (ditto), and left the crampons in the truck. Most important was the porcupine wire that Hamish Mutch suggested. We saw three of the critters on the road the night we drove in. At the trip\u2019s end (the rain had stopped after only 25 min.), we had a chat with three CMH employees who cycled up the road on mountain bikes. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Overall, a wonderful day on a peak we\u2019d both been dreaming about for 10-15 years.

They came from Nova Scotia in the early 1890s and prospected the Lardeau area for gold. In 1897, they located several mineral claims, including the Ophir-Lade, on a mountain that now bears their name. The claims were later worked on by Goldenville Mines Ltd. This company erected a small stamp mill (crusher) to extract the gold. The mineralized area was very restricted and the property was later abandoned.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Access to the area is via a secondary road from the community of Trout Lake, east of Gainer Creek. A seasonal four-wheel drive road leads northeast to Bunker Hill Creek. From here, access is by hiking and bushwhacking up an overgrown mining road along Gainer and Perry Lode Creeks to the valley between Badshot Mountain and Lade Peak. There is an intermittent trail around the north side of Lade Peak to the stamp mill. This historical mining artifact was free-standing for almost 100 years before the wooden cribbing rotted and it fell over sometime during the past 12 months. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The summit boasts spectacular views of many other named peaks including Badshot, Spine, Templeman, Mohican, Jowett and the Piton Peaks.
