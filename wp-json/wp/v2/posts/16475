Apparently, collectivos are on the road outside the airport but don\u2019t enter. I hailed an Uber but he refused the price listed ($15) and wanted $25 (normal taxis $35) and didn\u2019t appear, so I shared an Uber with an American couple ($10 of a $30 fare). They were going to a resort west of SD and I got off on the \u201cfreeway\u201d north of my hostel (La Chosa) in Colonia and walked down passing the National Palace and Mercado Modelo.<\/em><br \/>\n<strong>Puente Juan Bosch<\/strong>.

After Christopher Columbus&#8217;s arrival on the island in 1492, Santo Domingo became the site of the first cathedral, hospital, customs house, and university in the Americas. This colonial town, founded in 1498, was laid out on a grid pattern that became the model for almost all town planners in the New World.<br \/>\nThe first permanent establishment of the \u00ab\u00a0New World\u00a0\u00bb and capital of the West Indies, the Colonial City of Santo Domingo \u2013 the only one of the 15th century in the Americas \u2013 was the place of departure for the spread of European culture and the conquest of the continent. From its port conquerors such as Ponce de Leon, Juan de Esquivel, Herman Cortes, Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa, Alonso de Ojeda and many others departed in search of new lands.<br \/>\nLocated at the mouth of the Ozama, it is the core from which Santo Domingo de Guzman, the capital of the Dominican Republic, was founded. Originally established on the east side of the Ozama in 1496, it was founded by Bartholomew Columbus in 1498. In 1502, the city was transferred to the west bank and planned with a grid pattern from the Grand Place (Plaza Mayor). This checkerboard layout later became a reference for almost all the town planners of the New World.<br \/>\nCity of \u00ab\u00a0firsts\u00a0\u00bb,Santo Domingo was the headquarters for the first institutions in the Americas: Saint Mary of the Incarnation Cathedral, Saint Francois Monastery, Saint Thomas Aquinas University,\u00a0 Nicholas de Bari Hospital, and the\u00a0Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n.\u00a0 It is also the first fortified city and the first headquarters of Spanish power in the New World.<br \/>\nOver an area of 106 ha, bordered by walls, bastions, and forts, the city has 32 streets that criss-cross the 116 blocks, constructions of one or two levels with stone, brick, or earthen walls. Its original plan, the scale of its streets, and its buildings are almost totally intact including Gothic buildings unique in this region.and the appearance of the first indications of the Renaissance, as is eloquently illustrated in its cathedral.<br \/>\nCity of encounters, the Dominican monk, Brother Antonio Montesino launched his appeal for the natural right of the natives, marking the beginning of the combat for the fundamental rights of mankind.<br \/>\nIts institutional buildings date from the 16th century \u2013 Palace of the Viceroy,\u00a0Cabildo\u00a0(Town Hall),\u00a0Real Audiencia (Royal Court of Justice)\u00a0Chancery and Cathedral.<\/p>\n<p><em>Hostel La Chosa.

The project began in 1976 when the construction of a nearby road and bridge crossing the\u00a0Chav\u00f3n River\u00a0had to be blasted through a mountain of stone. Charles Bludhorn, chairman of Paramount then parent\u00a0Gulf+Western, had the idea of using the stones to re-create a sixteenth-century style Mediterranean village, similar to some of the architecture found in the\u00a0historic center\u00a0of\u00a0Santo Domingo.

This whole area is heavily touristed with many westerners.<\/p>\n<p><strong>PUERTO PLATA <\/strong><br \/>\n(San Felipe de Puerto Plata), is the third-largest city in the\u00a0Dominican Republic. Puerto Plata has resorts such as Playa Dorada and Costa Dorada, which are located east of the city proper. There are 100,000 hotel beds in the city.<br \/>\nThe fortification\u00a0Fortaleza San Felipe, which was built in the 16th century and served as a prison under\u00a0Rafael Trujillo&#8217;s dictatorship, lies close to the port of Puerta Plata. The\u00a0amber\u00a0museum, is also a well-known attraction in this city.\u00a0La Isabela, a settlement built by\u00a0Christopher Columbus, is located near Puerto Plata. In April 1563, the Spanish settlement became notorious when the English slave trader\u00a0Sir John Hawkins\u00a0brought 400 people he had abducted from\u00a0Sierra Leone. Hawkins traded his victims with the Spanish for pearls, hides, sugar, and some gold. This was the start of British involvement in the trans-Atlantic\u00a0slave trade.<br \/>\nThe city sits on land that rises abruptly from the sea making it almost completely visible from the port. It is bordered on the north by the Atlantic Ocean and to the south and southwest by the hill Isabel de Torres.<br \/>\nThe small bay around which the city was built provides a natural harbor. Puerto Plata is the largest city on the northern seaboard. The mountain Isabel de Torres is situated some 5\u00a0km to the southwest of the city of San Felipe. It is possible to drive to the top of the mountain by following the highway Don Jos\u00e9 Ginebra. At the summit, there is a tropical botanical garden covering about 7 acres (28,000\u00a0m2), featuring 600 varieties of tropical plants.<br \/>\n<strong>Climate.<\/strong> Puerto Plata has a\u00a0tropical monsoon climate, with hot, somewhat wet summers and warm, very wet winters<br \/>\n<strong>History. <\/strong>Since the founding of La Isabela, the first village in the New World, on January 2, 1494, Puerto Plata has been a town of firsts in the Americas.<br \/>\nHistorians are not clear on the exact year of Puerto Plata&#8217;s founding but was between 1503-06.<br \/>\nChristopher Columbus, on his first trip, called the mountain Monte de Plata, observing that since the top is frequently foggy it had a silver-like appearance, hence the name of the port. Around 1555, Puerto Plata&#8217;s importance as a port town was lost and it became one of the places of the Antilles frequented by\u00a0pirates.<br \/>\nIn 1605 it was depopulated and destroyed by order of\u00a0Felipe III, to hinder the advance of English piracy.

On highways, they pay no attention to the fast and slow lanes, and most drive with brights on at night.<br \/>\n<strong>3. Motocyclists.<\/strong> Easily the most common way to get around in DR. It would be interesting to find the death and serious injury stats as they follow no rules &#8211; zero helmets, ignor red. lights, drive on the wrong side, often have no tail lights at night, and carry a lot of cargo. They are always in the way making passing difficult. They get very indignant it treated them like they treat others.<br \/>\n<strong>4. Lotteries.<\/strong> Easily the dominant building in the DR, there are at least 5 lotteries, each with their own kiosks, usually manned and often busy. A sign of poor countries, only poor people who can least afford it, buy these tickets.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0GENERAL INFORMATION<br \/>\n<\/strong>The\u00a0<b>Dominican Republic<\/b>\u00a0is\u00a0located on the island of\u00a0Hispaniola\u00a0in the\u00a0Greater Antilles\u00a0archipelago of the\u00a0Caribbean. It occupies the eastern five-eighths of the island, which it shares with\u00a0Haiti,\u00a0making Hispaniola one of only two Caribbean islands, along with\u00a0Saint Martin, that is shared by two\u00a0sovereign states. The Dominican Republic is the second-largest nation in the\u00a0Antilles\u00a0by area (after\u00a0Cuba) at 48,671 square kilometers (18,792\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), and third-largest by population, with approximately 10.8 million people (2020 est.), of whom approximately 3.3 million live in the metropolitan area of\u00a0Santo Domingo, the capital city.\u00a0The official language of the country is\u00a0Spanish.<br \/>\nThe native\u00a0Ta\u00edno\u00a0people had inhabited Hispaniola before the arrival of Europeans, dividing it into five chiefdoms.\u00a0They had constructed an advanced farming and hunting society, and were in the process of becoming an organized civilization.\u00a0The Ta\u00ednos also inhabited Cuba,\u00a0Jamaica,\u00a0Puerto Rico, and\u00a0the Bahamas. The\u00a0Genoese\u00a0mariner\u00a0Christopher Columbus\u00a0explored and claimed the island for\u00a0Castile, landing there on his first voyage in 1492.\u00a0The\u00a0colony of Santo Domingo\u00a0became the site of the first permanent European settlement in the Americas and the first seat of Spanish colonial rule in the\u00a0New World. In 1697, Spain recognized French dominion over the western third of the island, which became the independent state of\u00a0Haiti\u00a0in 1804.<br \/>\nAfter more than three hundred years of Spanish rule, the Dominican people declared independence in November 1821.\u00a0The leader of the independence movement,\u00a0Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres, intended the Dominican nation to unite with the country of\u00a0Gran Colombia, but the newly independent Dominicans were forcefully annexed by Haiti in February 1822. Independence came 22 years later in 1844,\u00a0after victory in the\u00a0Dominican War of Independence. Over the next 72 years, the Dominican Republic experienced mostly civil wars (financed with loans from European merchants), several failed invasions by its neighbour, Haiti, and a brief return to Spanish colonial status, before permanently ousting the Spanish during the\u00a0Dominican War of Restoration\u00a0of 1863\u20131865.\u00a0During this period, two presidents were assassinated (Ulises Heureaux\u00a0in 1899 and\u00a0Ram\u00f3n C\u00e1ceres\u00a0in 1911).<br \/>\nThe\u00a0U.S. occupied\u00a0the Dominican Republic (1916\u20131924) due to threats of defaulting on foreign debts; a subsequent calm and prosperous six-year period under\u00a0Horacio V\u00e1squez\u00a0followed. From 1930 the dictatorship of\u00a0Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo\u00a0ruled until his assassination in 1961.\u00a0Juan Bosch\u00a0was elected president in 1962 but was deposed in a military coup in 1963. A\u00a0civil war in 1965, the country&#8217;s last, was ended by U.S. military intervention and was followed by the authoritarian rule of\u00a0Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer\u00a0(1966\u20131978 and 1986\u20131996). Since 1978, the Dominican Republic has moved toward\u00a0representative democracy,\u00a0and has been led by\u00a0Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez\u00a0for most of the time after 1996.\u00a0Danilo Medina\u00a0succeeded Fern\u00e1ndez in 2012, winning 51% of the electoral vote over his opponent ex-president\u00a0Hip\u00f3lito Mej\u00eda.\u00a0He was later succeeded by\u00a0Luis Abinader\u00a0in the 2020 presidential election.<br \/>\nThe Dominican Republic has the\u00a0largest economy\u00a0(according to the\u00a0U.S. State Department\u00a0and the\u00a0World Bank) in the Caribbean and Central American region and is the\u00a0seventh-largest economy\u00a0in\u00a0Latin America.\u00a0Over the last 25 years, the Dominican Republic has had the fastest-growing economy in the\u00a0Western Hemisphere\u00a0\u2013 with an average\u00a0real GDP growth rate\u00a0of 5.3% between 1992 and 2018.\u00a0GDP growth in 2014 and 2015 reached 7.3 and 7.0%, respectively, the highest in the Western Hemisphere.\u00a0In the first half of 2016, the Dominican economy grew 7.4% continuing its trend of rapid\u00a0economic growth.\u00a0Recent growth has been driven by construction, manufacturing, tourism, and mining. The country is the site of the third largest\u00a0gold mine\u00a0in the world, the\u00a0Pueblo Viejo mine.\u00a0Private consumption has been strong, as a result of low inflation (under 1% on average in 2015), job creation, and a high level of\u00a0remittances.\u00a0Illegal\u00a0Haitian immigration is a big problem in the Dominican Republic, putting a strain on the Dominican economy and increasing tensions between Dominicans and Haitians.\u00a0The Dominican Republic is also home to 114,050 illegal immigrants from\u00a0Venezuela.<sup id=\"cite_ref-CIADemo_5-12\" class=\"reference\"><br \/>\n<\/sup>The Dominican Republic is the\u00a0most visited destination\u00a0in the Caribbean.\u00a0The year-round golf courses are major attractions.<br \/>\nA geographically diverse nation, the Dominican Republic is home to both the Caribbean&#8217;s tallest mountain peak,\u00a0Pico Duarte, and the Caribbean&#8217;s largest lake and lowest point,\u00a0Lake Enriquillo.\u00a0The island has an average temperature of 26\u00a0\u00b0C (78.8\u00a0\u00b0F) and great climatic and biological diversity.\u00a0The country is also the site of the first cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress built in the Americas, located in Santo Domingo&#8217;s\u00a0Colonial Zone, a\u00a0World Heritage Site.\u00a0Baseball is the\u00a0<i>de facto<\/i>\u00a0national sport.<sup id=\"cite_ref-embassy_6-3\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup><\/p>\n<p>The name Dominican originates from\u00a0Santo Domingo de Guzm\u00e1n\u00a0(Saint Dominic), the patron saint of\u00a0astronomers, and founder of the\u00a0Dominican Order.<br \/>\nThe Dominican Order established a house of high studies on the colony of\u00a0Santo Domingo\u00a0that is now known as the\u00a0Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Santo Domingo, the first University in the New World.

They engaged in farming, fishing,\u00a0hunting and gathering.\u00a0The fierce\u00a0Caribs\u00a0drove the Ta\u00edno to the northeastern Caribbean, during much of the 15th century.<br \/>\nThe Spaniards arrived in 1492. Initially, after friendly relationships, the Ta\u00ednos resisted the conquest. Within a few years after 1492, the population of Ta\u00ednos had declined drastically, due to\u00a0smallpox,\u00a0measles, and other diseases that arrived with the Europeans.<br \/>\nThe first recorded smallpox outbreak, in the Americas, occurred on Hispaniola in 1507.\u00a0\u00a0The last record of pure Ta\u00ednos in the country was from 1864. Still, Ta\u00edno biological heritage survived to an important extent, due to intermixing. Census records from 1514 reveal that 40% of Spanish men in Santo Domingo were married to Ta\u00edno women,\u00a0and some present-day Dominicans have Ta\u00edno ancestry.\u00a0Remnants of the Ta\u00edno culture include their cave paintings,\u00a0such as the\u00a0Pomier Caves, as well as pottery designs, which are still used in the small artisan village of Hig\u00fcerito,\u00a0Moca.<br \/>\n<strong><span id=\"European_colonization\" class=\"mw-headline\">European colonization.\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>Christopher Columbus\u00a0arrived on the island on December 5, 1492, during the first of his\u00a0four voyages\u00a0to the Americas. He claimed the land for Spain and named it\u00a0<i>La Espa\u00f1ola<\/i>, due to its diverse climate and terrain, which reminded him of the\u00a0Spanish landscape.\u00a0In 1496,\u00a0Bartholomew Columbus, Christopher&#8217;s brother, built the city of\u00a0Santo Domingo, Western Europe&#8217;s first permanent settlement in the &#8220;New World&#8221;. The Spaniards created a\u00a0plantation economy\u00a0on the island.\u00a0The colony was the springboard for the further Spanish conquest of America and for decades the headquarters of Spanish power in the hemisphere.<br \/>\nThe Ta\u00ednos nearly disappeared, above all, due to European\u00a0infectious diseases.\u00a0Other causes were abuse, suicide, the breakup of family, starvation,\u00a0the\u00a0encomienda\u00a0system,\u00a0which resembled a\u00a0feudal system\u00a0in Medieval Europe,\u00a0war with the Spaniards, changes in lifestyle, and mixing with other peoples. Laws passed for the native peoples&#8217; protection (beginning with the\u00a0Laws of Burgos, 1512\u20131513)\u00a0were never truly enforced. African slaves were imported to replace the dwindling Ta\u00ednos.<br \/>\nAfter its conquest of the\u00a0Aztecs\u00a0and\u00a0Incas, Spain neglected its Caribbean holdings. Hispaniola&#8217;s sugar plantation economy quickly declined. Most Spanish colonists left for the silver-mines of\u00a0Mexico\u00a0and\u00a0Peru, while new immigrants from Spain bypassed the island. Agriculture dwindled, new imports of slaves ceased, and white colonists, free blacks, and slaves alike lived in poverty, weakening the racial hierarchy and aiding\u00a0<i>intermixing<\/i>, resulting in a population of predominantly mixed Spaniard, Ta\u00edno, and African descent. Except for the city of Santo Domingo, which managed to maintain some legal exports, Dominican ports were forced to rely on contraband trade, which, along with livestock, became one of the main sources of livelihood for the island&#8217;s inhabitants.<br \/>\nIn the mid-17th century, France sent colonists to settle the island of\u00a0Tortuga\u00a0and the northwestern coast of Hispaniola (which the Spaniards had\u00a0abandoned by 1606) due to its strategic position in the region. In order to entice the\u00a0pirates, France supplied them with women who had been taken from prisons, accused of prostitution and thieving. After decades of armed struggles with the French settlers, Spain ceded the western coast of the island to France with the 1697\u00a0Treaty of Ryswick, whilst the Central Plateau remained under Spanish domain. France created a wealthy colony on the island, while the Spanish colony continued to suffer economic decline.<br \/>\nOn April 17, 1655,\u00a0English\u00a0forces landed on Hispaniola, and marched 30 miles overland to\u00a0Santo Domingo, the main Spanish stronghold on the island, where they\u00a0laid siege\u00a0to it. Spanish\u00a0lancers\u00a0attacked the English forces, sending them careening back toward the beach in confusion.<br \/>\n<span id=\"18th_century\" class=\"mw-headline\"><strong>18th century.<\/strong>\u00a0<\/span>The\u00a0House of Bourbon\u00a0replaced the\u00a0House of Habsburg\u00a0in Spain in 1700, and introduced economic reforms that gradually began to revive trade in Santo Domingo. The crown progressively relaxed the rigid controls and restrictions on commerce between Spain and the colonies and among the colonies. The last\u00a0<i>flotas<\/i>\u00a0sailed in 1737; the monopoly port system was abolished shortly thereafter. By the middle of the century, the population was bolstered by emigration from the\u00a0Canary Islands, resettling the northern part of the colony and planting tobacco in the\u00a0Cibao Valley, and importation of slaves was renewed.<br \/>\nSanto Domingo&#8217;s exports soared and the island&#8217;s agricultural productivity rose, which was assisted by the involvement of\u00a0Spain\u00a0in the\u00a0Seven Years&#8217; War, allowing\u00a0privateers\u00a0operating out of Santo Domingo to once again patrol surrounding waters for enemy\u00a0merchantmen.\u00a0Dominican privateers in the service of the Spanish Crown had already been active in the\u00a0War of Jenkins&#8217; Ear\u00a0just two decades prior, and they sharply reduced the amount of enemy trade operating in\u00a0West Indian\u00a0waters.\u00a0The\u00a0prizes\u00a0they took were carried back to Santo Domingo, where their cargoes were sold to the colony&#8217;s inhabitants or to foreign merchants doing business there. The enslaved population of the colony also rose dramatically, as numerous captive Africans were taken from enemy\u00a0slave ships\u00a0in West Indian waters.<br \/>\nBetween 1720 and 1774, Dominican privateers cruised the waters from Santo Domingo to the coast of\u00a0Tierra Firme, taking British, French, and Dutch ships with cargoes of African slaves and other commodities.\u00a0During the\u00a0American Revolutionary War\u00a0(1775\u201383), Dominican troops, shoulder to shoulder with Mexicans, Spaniards, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans\u00a0fought under General Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez&#8217; command in\u00a0West Florida.<br \/>\nThe colony of Santo Domingo saw a population increase during the 18th century, as it rose to about 91,272 in 1750. Of this number, approximately 38,272 were white landowners, 38,000 were free mixed people of color, and some 15,000 were slaves.\u00a0This contrasted sharply with the population of the French colony of Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti)\u00a0\u2013 the wealthiest colony in the Caribbean and whose population of one-half a million was 90% enslaved and overall, seven times as numerous as the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo.\u00a0The &#8216;Spanish&#8217; settlers, whose blood by now was mixed with that of Ta\u00ednos, Africans, and Canary\u00a0Guanches, proclaimed: &#8216;It does not matter if the French are richer than us, we are still the true inheritors of this island. In our veins runs the blood of the heroic\u00a0<i>conquistadores<\/i>\u00a0who won this island of ours with sword and blood. As restrictions on colonial trade were relaxed, the colonial elites of Saint-Domingue offered the principal market for Santo Domingo&#8217;s exports of beef, hides, mahogany, and tobacco. With the outbreak of the\u00a0Haitian Revolution\u00a0in 1791, the rich urban families linked to the colonial bureaucracy fled the island, while most of the rural\u00a0<i>hateros<\/i>\u00a0(cattle ranchers) remained, even though they lost their principal market.<br \/>\nInspired by disputes between whites and mulattoes in Saint-Domingue, a slave revolt broke out in the French colony. Although the population of Santo Domingo was perhaps one-fourth that of Saint-Domingue, this did not prevent the King of Spain from launching an invasion of the French side of the island in 1793, attempting to seize all, or part, of the western third of the island in an alliance of convenience with the rebellious slaves.\u00a0In August 1793, a\u00a0column\u00a0of Dominican troops advanced into Saint-Domingue and were joined by Haitian rebels.\u00a0However, these rebels soon turned against Spain and instead joined France. The Dominicans were not defeated militarily, but their advance was restrained, and when in 1795 Spain ceded Santo Domingo to France by the\u00a0Treaty of Basel, Dominican attacks on Saint-Domingue ceased. After Haiti received independence in 1804, the French retained Santo Domingo until 1809, when combined Spanish and Dominican forces, aided by the British, defeated the French, leading to a\u00a0recolonization by Spain.<br \/>\n<span id=\"Ephemeral_independence\" class=\"mw-headline\"><em>Ephemeral independence.<\/em>\u00a0<\/span>After a dozen years of discontent and failed independence plots by various opposing groups, Santo Domingo&#8217;s former Lieutenant-Governor (top administrator),\u00a0Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres, declared the colony&#8217;s independence from the\u00a0Spanish crown\u00a0as\u00a0Spanish Haiti, on November 30, 1821.

In order to raise funds for the huge indemnity of 150 million francs that Haiti agreed to pay the former French colonists, and which was subsequently lowered to 60 million francs, the Haitian government imposed heavy taxes on the Dominicans. Since Haiti was unable to adequately provision its army, the occupying forces largely survived by commandeering or confiscating food and supplies at gunpoint. Attempts to\u00a0redistribute\u00a0land conflicted with the system of communal land tenure (<i>terrenos comuneros<\/i>), which had arisen with the ranching economy, and some people resented being forced to grow cash crops under Boyer and\u00a0Joseph Balthazar Inginac&#8217;s\u00a0<i>Code Rural.<\/i>\u00a0In the rural and rugged mountainous areas, the Haitian administration was usually too inefficient to enforce its own laws. It was in the city of Santo Domingo that the effects of the occupation were most acutely felt, and it was there that the movement for independence originated.<br \/>\nThe Haitians associated the\u00a0Roman Catholic Church\u00a0with the French slave-masters who had exploited them before independence and confiscated all church property, deported all foreign clergy, and severed the ties of the remaining clergy to the\u00a0Vatican. All levels of education collapsed; the university was shut down, as it was starved both of resources and students, with young Dominican men from 16 to 25 years old being drafted into the Haitian army. Boyer&#8217;s occupation troops, who were largely Dominicans,\u00a0were unpaid and had to &#8220;forage and sack&#8221; Dominican civilians. Haiti imposed a &#8220;heavy tribute&#8221; on the Dominican people.<br \/>\nHaiti&#8217;s constitution forbade white elites from owning land, and Dominican major landowning families were forcibly deprived of their properties. During this time, many white elites in Santo Domingo did not consider owning slaves due to the economic crisis that Santo Domingo faced during the\u00a0Espa\u00f1a Boba\u00a0period. The few landowners that wanted slavery established in Santo Domingo had to emigrate to\u00a0Cuba,\u00a0Puerto Rico, or\u00a0Gran Colombia. Many landowning families stayed on the island, with a heavy concentration of landowners settling in the Cibao region. After independence, and eventually being under\u00a0Spanish rule\u00a0once again in 1861, many families returned to Santo Domingo including new waves of immigration from\u00a0Spain.<br \/>\n<span id=\"Dominican_War_of_Independence_.281844.E2.80.9356.29\"><\/span><span id=\"Dominican_War_of_Independence_(1844\u201356)\" class=\"mw-headline\"><strong>Dominican War of Independence<\/strong> (1844\u201356).\u00a0<\/span>In 1838,\u00a0Juan Pablo Duarte\u00a0founded a secret society called\u00a0La Trinitaria, which sought the complete independence of Santo Domingo without any foreign intervention.\u00a0Duarte, Mella, and S\u00e1nchez are considered the three Founding Fathers of the Dominican Republic.<br \/>\nIn 1843, the new Haitian president,\u00a0Charles Rivi\u00e8re-H\u00e9rard, exiled or imprisoned the leading\u00a0<i>Trinitarios<\/i>\u00a0(Trinitarians).\u00a0After subduing the Dominicans, Rivi\u00e8re-H\u00e9rard, a mulatto, faced a rebellion by blacks in\u00a0Port-au-Prince. Haiti had formed two regiments composed of Dominicans from the city of Santo Domingo; these were used by Rivi\u00e8re-H\u00e9rard to suppress the uprising.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Scheina_71-2\" class=\"reference\"><br \/>\n<\/sup>On February 27, 1844, the surviving members of\u00a0<i>La Trinitaria<\/i>, now led by\u00a0Tom\u00e1s Bobadilla, declared independence from Haiti. The\u00a0<i>Trinitarios<\/i>\u00a0were backed by\u00a0Pedro Santana, a wealthy cattle rancher from\u00a0El Seibo, who became general of the army of the nascent republic. The Dominican Republic&#8217;s first\u00a0Constitution\u00a0was adopted on November 6, 1844, and was modeled after the\u00a0United States Constitution.\u00a0The decades that followed were filled with tyranny, factionalism, economic difficulties, rapid changes of government, and exile for political opponents. Archrivals Santana and\u00a0Buenaventura B\u00e1ez\u00a0held power most of the time, both ruling arbitrarily. They promoted competing plans to annex the new nation to another power: Santana favored Spain, and B\u00e1ez the United States.<br \/>\nThreatening the nation&#8217;s independence were renewed Haitian invasions. In March 1844, Rivi\u00e8re-H\u00e9rard attempted to reimpose his authority, but the Dominicans put up stiff opposition and inflicted heavy casualties on the Haitians.\u00a0In early July 1844, Duarte was urged by his followers to take the title of President of the Republic. Duarte agreed, but only if free elections were arranged. However, Santana&#8217;s forces took Santo Domingo on July 12, and they declared Santana ruler of the Dominican Republic. Santana then put Mella, Duarte, and S\u00e1nchez in jail. On February 27, 1845, Santana executed\u00a0Mar\u00eda Trinidad S\u00e1nchez, heroine of La Trinitaria, and others for conspiracy.<br \/>\nOn June 17, 1845, small Dominican\u00a0detachments\u00a0invaded Haiti, capturing\u00a0Lascahobas\u00a0and\u00a0Hinche. The Dominicans established an\u00a0outpost\u00a0at Cachim\u00e1n, but the arrival of Haitian reinforcements soon compelled them to retreat back across the frontier. Haiti launched a new invasion on August 6. The Dominicans repelled the Haitian forces, on both land and sea, by December 1845.<br \/>\nThe Haitians invaded again in 1849, forcing the president of the Dominican Republic,\u00a0Manuel Jimenes, to call upon Santana, whom he had ousted as president, to lead the Dominicans against this new invasion. Santana met the enemy at\u00a0Ocoa, April 21, with only 400 militiamen, and succeeded in defeating the 18,000-strong Haitian army.\u00a0The battle began with heavy cannon fire by the entrenched Haitians and ended with a Dominican assault followed by\u00a0hand-to-hand combat. In November 1849, Dominican seamen raided the Haitian coasts, plundered seaside villages, as far as\u00a0Dame Marie, and butchered crews of captured enemy ships.<br \/>\nBy 1854 both countries were at war again. In November, a Dominican squadron composed of the\u00a0brigantine\u00a0<i>27 de Febrero<\/i>\u00a0and\u00a0schooner\u00a0<i>Constituci\u00f3n<\/i>\u00a0captured a Haitian warship and bombarded\u00a0Anse-\u00e0-Pitres\u00a0and\u00a0Saltrou. In November 1855, Haiti invaded again. Over 1,000 Haitian soldiers were killed in the battles of Santom\u00e9 and Cambronal in December 1855. The Haitians suffered even greater losses at Sabana Larga and J\u00e1cuba in January 1856. That same month, an engagement at\u00a0Ouanaminthe\u00a0again resulted in heavy Haitian casualties, bringing an effective halt to the invasion.<br \/>\n<span id=\"First_Republic\" class=\"mw-headline\"><strong>First Republic.<\/strong>\u00a0<\/span>The Dominican Republic&#8217;s first\u00a0constitution\u00a0was adopted on November 6, 1844. The state was commonly known as Santo Domingo in English until the early 20th century.\u00a0It featured a presidential form of government with many liberal tendencies, but it was marred by Article 210, imposed by\u00a0Pedro Santana\u00a0on the constitutional assembly by force, giving him the privileges of a dictatorship until the war of independence was over. These privileges not only served him to win the war but also allowed him to persecute, execute and drive into exile his political opponents, among which Duarte was the most important.<br \/>\nThe population of the Dominican Republic in 1845 was approximately 230,000 people (100,000 whites; 40,000 blacks; and 90,000 mulattoes).<br \/>\nDue to the rugged mountainous terrain of the island the regions of the Dominican Republic developed in isolation from one another. In the south, also known at the time as Ozama, the economy was dominated by cattle-ranching (particularly in the southeastern savannah) and cutting mahogany and other hardwoods for export. This region retained a semi-feudal character, with little commercial agriculture, the hacienda as the dominant social unit, and the majority of the population living at a subsistence level. In the north (better-known as Cibao), the nation&#8217;s richest farmland, farmers supplemented their subsistence crops by growing tobacco for export, mainly to Germany. Tobacco required less land than cattle ranching and was mainly grown by smallholders, who relied on itinerant traders to transport their crops to Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi.<br \/>\nSantana antagonized the Cibao farmers, enriching himself and his supporters at their expense by resorting to multiple peso printings that allowed him to buy their crops for a fraction of their value. In 1848, he was forced to resign and was succeeded by his vice-president,\u00a0Manuel Jimenes.<br \/>\nAfter defeating a new Haitian invasion in 1849, Santana marched on Santo Domingo and deposed Jimenes in a\u00a0coup d&#8217;\u00e9tat. At his behest, Congress elected Buenaventura B\u00e1ez as president, but B\u00e1ez was unwilling to serve as Santana&#8217;s puppet, challenging his role as the country&#8217;s acknowledged military leader. In 1853, Santana was elected president for his second term, forcing B\u00e1ez into exile. Three years later, after repulsing another Haitian invasion, he negotiated a treaty leasing a portion of Saman\u00e1 Peninsula to a U.S. company; popular opposition forced him to abdicate, enabling B\u00e1ez to return and seize power.<br \/>\nWith the treasury depleted, B\u00e1ez printed eighteen million uninsured pesos, purchasing the 1857 tobacco crop with this currency and exporting it for hard cash at immense profit to himself and his followers. Cibao tobacco planters, who were ruined when hyperinflation ensued, revolted and formed a new government headed by\u00a0Jos\u00e9 Desiderio Valverde\u00a0and headquartered in Santiago de los Caballeros.<br \/>\nIn July 1857, General Juan Luis Franco Bid\u00f3 besieged Santo Domingo. The Cibao-based government declared an amnesty to exiles and Santana returned and managed to replace Franco Bid\u00f3 in September 1857. After a year of civil war, Santana captured Santo Domingo in June 1858, overthrew both B\u00e1ez and Valverde and installed himself as president.<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-Cross_87-0\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>In 1861, Santana asked Queen\u00a0Isabella II of Spain\u00a0to retake control of the Dominican Republic, after a period of only 17 years of independence. Spain, which had not come to terms with the\u00a0loss of its American colonies\u00a040 years earlier, accepted his proposal and made the country a colony again.\u00a0Haiti, fearful of the reestablishment of Spain as colonial power, gave refuge and logistics to revolutionaries seeking to reestablish the independent nation of the Dominican Republic. The ensuing civil war, known as the\u00a0<i>War of Restoration<\/i>, claimed more than 50,000 lives.<br \/>\n<em>The\u00a0War of Restoration<\/em>\u00a0began in Santiago on August 16, 1863. Spain had a difficult time fighting the Dominican\u00a0guerrillas. Over the course of the war, they would spend over 33 million pesos and suffer 30,000 casualties.\u00a0In the south, Dominican forces under\u00a0Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cabral\u00a0defeated the Spanish in the\u00a0Battle of La Canela\u00a0on December 4, 1864. The victory showed the Dominicans that they could defeat the Spaniards in\u00a0pitched battle.\u00a0After two years of fighting, Spain abandoned the island in 1865.\u00a0Political strife again prevailed in the following years; warlords ruled, military revolts were extremely common, and the nation amassed debt.<br \/>\nAfter the\u00a0Ten Years&#8217; War\u00a0(1868\u201378) broke out in\u00a0Spanish Cuba, Dominican exiles, including\u00a0M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez,\u00a0Luis Marcano\u00a0and\u00a0Modesto D\u00edaz, joined the\u00a0Cuban Revolutionary Army\u00a0and provided its initial training and leadership.<br \/>\nIn 1869, U.S. President\u00a0Ulysses S. Grant\u00a0ordered U.S. Marines to the island for the first time.\u00a0Pirates operating from Haiti had been raiding U.S. commercial shipping in the Caribbean, and Grant directed the Marines to stop them at their source.\u00a0Following the virtual takeover of the island, B\u00e1ez offered to\u00a0sell the country to the United States.\u00a0Grant desired a naval base at\u00a0Saman\u00e1\u00a0and also a place for resettling newly freed\u00a0African Americans.\u00a0The treaty, which included U.S. payment of $1.5 million for Dominican debt repayment, was defeated in the\u00a0United States Senate\u00a0in 1870\u00a0on a vote of 28\u201328, two-thirds being required.<br \/>\nB\u00e1ez was\u00a0toppled in 1874, returned, and was toppled for good in 1878. A new generation was thence in charge, with the passing of Santana (he died in 1864) and B\u00e1ez from the scene. Relative peace came to the country in the 1880s, which saw the coming to power of General\u00a0Ulises Heureaux.\u00a0&#8220;Lil\u00eds&#8221;, as the new president was nicknamed, enjoyed a period of popularity. He was, however, &#8220;a consummate dissembler&#8221;, who put the nation deep into debt while using much of the proceeds for his personal use and to maintain his police state. Heureaux became rampantly despotic and unpopular.\u00a0In 1899, he was assassinated. However, the relative calm over which he presided allowed improvement in the Dominican economy. The sugar industry was modernized,\u00a0and the country attracted foreign workers and immigrants.<br \/>\nLebanese, Syrians, Turks, and Palestinians began to arrive in the country during the latter part of the 19th century.\u00a0At first, the\u00a0Arab\u00a0immigrants often faced discrimination in the Dominican Republic, but they were eventually assimilated into Dominican society, giving up their own culture and language.\u00a0During the U.S. occupation of 1916\u201324, peasants from the countryside, called Gavilleros, would not only kill U.S. Marines, but would also attack and kill Arab vendors traveling through the countryside.<br \/>\n<span id=\"20th_century_.281900.E2.80.9330.29\"><\/span><span id=\"20th_century_(1900\u201330)\" class=\"mw-headline\"><strong>20th century (1900\u201330).<\/strong>\u00a0<\/span>From 1902 on, short-lived governments were again the norm, with their power usurped by\u00a0caudillos\u00a0in parts of the country. Furthermore, the national government was bankrupt and, unable to pay its debts to European creditors, faced the threat of military intervention by France,\u00a0Germany, and\u00a0Italy.\u00a0United States President\u00a0Theodore Roosevelt\u00a0sought to prevent European intervention, largely to protect the routes to the future\u00a0Panama Canal, as the canal was already under construction. He made a small military intervention to ward off European powers, to proclaim his famous\u00a0Roosevelt Corollary\u00a0to the\u00a0Monroe Doctrine, and also to obtain his 1905 Dominican agreement for U.S. administration of Dominican customs, which was the chief source of income for the Dominican government. A 1906 agreement provided for the arrangement to last 50 years. The United States agreed to use part of the customs proceeds to reduce the immense foreign debt of the Dominican Republic and assumed responsibility for said debt.<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-Encarta_45-2\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>After six years in power, President\u00a0Ram\u00f3n C\u00e1ceres\u00a0(who had himself assassinated Heureaux)\u00a0was assassinated in 1911. The result was several years of great political instability and\u00a0civil war. U.S. mediation by the\u00a0William Howard Taft\u00a0and\u00a0Woodrow Wilson\u00a0administrations achieved only a short respite each time. A political deadlock in 1914 was broken after an ultimatum by Wilson telling the Dominicans to choose a president or see the U.S. impose one. A provisional president was chosen, and later the same year relatively free elections put former president (1899\u20131902)\u00a0Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra\u00a0back in power. To achieve a more broadly supported government, Jimenes named opposition individuals to his cabinet. But this brought no peace and, with his former\u00a0Secretary of War\u00a0Desiderio Arias\u00a0maneuvering to depose him and despite a U.S. offer of military aid against Arias, Jimenes resigned on May 7, 1916.<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-congress_103-0\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>Wilson thus ordered the U.S. occupation of the Dominican Republic.\u00a0U.S. Marines\u00a0landed on May 16, 1916, and had control of the country two months later. The military government established by the U.S., led by Vice Admiral\u00a0Harry Shepard Knapp, was widely repudiated by the Dominicans, with caudillos in the mountainous eastern regions leading guerrilla campaigns against U.S. forces.\u00a0Arias&#8217;s forces, who had no machine guns or modern artillery, tried to take on the U.S. Marines in conventional battles, but were defeated at the\u00a0Battle of Guayacanas\u00a0and the\u00a0Battle of San Francisco de Macoris.<br \/>\nThe occupation regime kept most Dominican laws and institutions and largely pacified the general population. The occupying government also revived the Dominican economy, reduced the nation&#8217;s debt, built a road network that at last interconnected all regions of the country, and created a professional National Guard to replace the warring partisan units.\u00a0Opposition to the occupation continued, nevertheless, and after World War I it increased in the U.S. as well. There, President\u00a0Warren G. Harding\u00a0(1921\u201323), Wilson&#8217;s successor, worked to put an end to the occupation, as he had promised to do during his campaign. The U.S. government&#8217;s rule ended in October 1922, and elections were held in March 1924.<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-congress_103-3\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>The victor was former president (1902\u201303)\u00a0Horacio V\u00e1squez, who had cooperated with the U.S. He was inaugurated on July 13, 1924, and the last U.S. forces left in September. In six years, the Marines were involved in at least 370 engagements, with 950 &#8220;bandits&#8221; killed or wounded in action\u00a0to the Marines&#8217; 144 killed.\u00a0V\u00e1squez gave the country six years of stable governance, in which political and civil rights were respected and the economy grew strongly, in a relatively peaceful atmosphere.<br \/>\nDuring the government of Horacio V\u00e1squez,\u00a0Rafael Trujillo\u00a0held the rank of lieutenant colonel and was chief of police. This position helped him launch his plans to overthrow the government of V\u00e1squez. Trujillo had the support of Carlos Rosario Pe\u00f1a, who formed the Civic Movement, which had as its main objective to overthrow the government of V\u00e1squez.<br \/>\nIn February 1930, when V\u00e1squez attempted to win another term, his opponents rebelled in secret alliance with the commander of the National Army (the former National Guard), General Rafael Trujillo. Trujillo secretly cut a deal with rebel leader\u00a0Rafael Estrella Ure\u00f1a; in return for letting Ure\u00f1a take power, Trujillo would be allowed to run for president in new elections. As the rebels marched toward Santo Domingo, V\u00e1squez ordered Trujillo to suppress them. However, feigning &#8220;neutrality,&#8221; Trujillo kept his men in barracks, allowing Ure\u00f1a&#8217;s rebels to take the capital virtually uncontested. On March 3, Ure\u00f1a was proclaimed acting president with Trujillo confirmed as head of the police and the army. As per their agreement, Trujillo became the presidential nominee of the newly formed Patriotic Coalition of Citizens (Spanish: Coalici\u00f3n patriotica de los ciudadanos), with Ure\u00f1a as his running mate.<br \/>\nDuring the election campaign, Trujillo used the army to unleash his repression, forcing his opponents to withdraw from the race. Trujillo stood to elect himself, and in May he was elected president virtually unopposed after a violent campaign against his opponents, ascending to power on August 16, 1930.<br \/>\n<span id=\"Trujillo_Era_.281930.E2.80.9361.29\"><\/span><span id=\"Trujillo_Era_(1930\u201361)\" class=\"mw-headline\"><strong>Trujillo Era (1930\u201361).<\/strong>\u00a0<\/span>Rafael Trujillo\u00a0imposed a dictatorship of 31 years in the country (1930\u20131961). There was considerable economic growth during\u00a0Rafael Trujillo&#8217;s long and iron-fisted regime, although a great deal of the wealth was taken by the dictator and other regime elements. There was progress in healthcare, education, and transportation, with the building of hospitals, clinics, schools, roads, and harbors. Trujillo also carried out an important housing construction program, and instituted a pension plan. He finally negotiated an undisputed border with Haiti in 1935, and achieved the end of the 50-year customs agreement in 1941, instead of 1956. He made the country debt-free in 1947.\u00a0This was accompanied by absolute repression and the copious use of murder, torture, and terrorist methods against the opposition. It has been estimated that Trujillo&#8217;s tyrannical rule was responsible for the death of more than 50,000 Dominicans.<br \/>\nTrujillo&#8217;s henchmen did not hesitate to use intimidation, torture, or assassination of political foes both at home and abroad.\u00a0Trujillo was responsible for the deaths of the Spaniards Jos\u00e9 Almoina in\u00a0Mexico City\u00a0and\u00a0Jes\u00fas Gal\u00edndez\u00a0in\u00a0New York City.<br \/>\nIn 1930,\u00a0Hurricane San Zenon\u00a0destroyed Santo Domingo and killed 8,000 people. During the rebuilding process, Trujillo renamed Santo Domingo to &#8220;Ciudad Trujillo&#8221; (Trujillo City),\u00a0and the nation&#8217;s\u00a0\u2013 and the Caribbean&#8217;s\u00a0\u2013 highest mountain\u00a0<i>La Pelona Grande<\/i>\u00a0(Spanish for: The Great Bald) to &#8220;Pico Trujillo&#8221; (Spanish for: Trujillo Peak). By the end of his first term in 1934 he was the country&#8217;s wealthiest person,\u00a0and one of the wealthiest in the world by the early 1950s;\u00a0near the end of his regime his fortune was an estimated $800 million ($5.3 billion today).<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-Hall_100-1\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>Trujillo, who neglected the fact that his maternal great-grandmother was from Haiti&#8217;s mulatto class, actively promoted propaganda against Haitian people.\u00a0In 1937, he ordered what became known as the\u00a0Parsley Massacre\u00a0or, in the Dominican Republic, as\u00a0<i>El Corte<\/i>\u00a0(The Cutting),\u00a0directing the army to kill Haitians living on the Dominican side of the border. The army killed an estimated 17,000 to 35,000 Haitian men, women, and children over six days, from the night of October 2, 1937, through October 8, 1937. To avoid leaving evidence of the army&#8217;s involvement, the soldiers used\u00a0edged weapons\u00a0rather than guns.\u00a0The soldiers were said to have interrogated anyone with dark skin, using the\u00a0shibboleth\u00a0<i>perejil<\/i>\u00a0(parsley) to distinguish Haitians from Afro-Dominicans when necessary; the &#8216;r&#8217; of\u00a0<i>perejil<\/i>\u00a0was of difficult pronunciation for Haitians.\u00a0As a result of the massacre, the Dominican Republic agreed to pay Haiti US$750,000, later reduced to US$525,000.<br \/>\nDuring\u00a0World War II, Trujillo symbolically sided with the\u00a0Allies\u00a0and declared war on Japan the day after the\u00a0attack on Pearl Harbor\u00a0and on Nazi Germany and Italy four days later. Soon after, German U-boats torpedoed and sank two Dominican merchant vessels that Trujillo had named after himself. German U-boats also sank four Dominican-manned ships in the Caribbean. The country did not make a military contribution to the war, but Dominican sugar and other agricultural products supported the Allied war effort. American\u00a0Lend-Lease\u00a0and raw material purchases proved a powerful inducement in obtaining cooperation of the various Latin American republics. Over a hundred Dominicans served in the American armed forces. Many were political\u00a0exiles\u00a0from the Trujillo regime.<br \/>\nTrujillo&#8217;s dictatorship was marred by botched invasions, international scandals and assassination attempts. 1947 brought the failure of a planned invasion by leftist Dominican exiles from the Cuban island of Cayo Confites. July 1949 was the year of a failed invasion from\u00a0Guatemala, and on June 14, 1959, there was a failed invasion at\u00a0Constanza, Maim\u00f3n and Estero Hondo by Dominican rebels from Cuba.<br \/>\nOn June 26, 1959, Cuba broke diplomatic relations with the Dominican Republic due to widespread Dominican\u00a0human rights\u00a0abuses and hostility toward the\u00a0Cuban people.<br \/>\nOn November 25, 1960, Trujillo&#8217;s henchmen killed three of the four\u00a0Mirabal sisters, nicknamed\u00a0<i>Las Mariposas<\/i>\u00a0(The Butterflies). The victims were Patria Mercedes Mirabal (born on February 27, 1924), Argentina Minerva Mirabal (born on March 12, 1926), and Antonia Mar\u00eda Teresa Mirabal (born on October 15, 1935). Along with their husbands, the sisters were conspiring to overthrow Trujillo in a violent revolt. The Mirabals had communist ideological leanings, as did their husbands. The sisters have received many honors posthumously and have many memorials in various cities in the Dominican Republic. Salcedo, their home province, changed its name to\u00a0Provincia Hermanas Mirabal\u00a0(Mirabal Sisters Province). The\u00a0International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women\u00a0is observed on the anniversary of their deaths.<br \/>\nFor a long time, the U.S. and the Dominican elite supported the Trujillo government. This support persisted despite the assassinations of political opposition, the massacre of Haitians, and Trujillo&#8217;s plots against other countries. The U.S. believed Trujillo was the lesser of two or more evils.\u00a0The U.S. finally broke with Trujillo in 1960, after Trujillo&#8217;s agents attempted to assassinate the Venezuelan president,\u00a0R\u00f3mulo Betancourt, a fierce critic of Trujillo.\u00a0Dominican agents placed a bomb in the Venezuelan president&#8217;s car in\u00a0Caracas, which exploded, injuring Betancourt and killing a number of his advisers.<br \/>\nIn June 1960, Trujillo legalized the Communist Party and attempted to establish close political relations with the Soviet Bloc. Both the assassination attempt and the maneuver toward the Soviet Bloc provoked immediate condemnation throughout Latin America. Once its representatives confirmed Trujillo&#8217;s complicity in the assassination attempt, the\u00a0Organization of American States, for the first time in its history, decreed sanctions against a member state. The United States severed diplomatic relations with the Dominican Republic on August 26, 1960, and in January 1961 suspended the export of trucks, parts, crude oil, gasoline and other petroleum products. U.S. President\u00a0Dwight D. Eisenhower\u00a0also took advantage of OAS sanctions to cut drastically purchases of Dominican sugar, the country&#8217;s major export. This action ultimately cost the Dominican Republic almost $22,000,000 in lost revenues at a time when its economy was in a rapid decline. Trujillo had become expendable.\u00a0Dissidents inside the Dominican Republic argued that assassination was the only certain way to remove Trujillo.<br \/>\nAccording to\u00a0Chester Bowles, the U.S. Undersecretary of State, internal\u00a0Department of State\u00a0discussions in 1961 on the topic were vigorous.\u00a0Richard N. Goodwin, Assistant Special Counsel to the President, who had direct contacts with the rebel alliance, argued for intervention against Trujillo.\u00a0Quoting Bowles directly:\u00a0<i>The next morning I learned that in spite of the clear decision against having the dissident group request our assistance Dick Goodwin following the meeting sent a cable to CIA people in the Dominican Republic without checking with State or CIA; indeed, with the protest of the Department of State. The cable directed the CIA people in the Dominican Republic to get this request at any cost. When\u00a0Allen Dulles\u00a0found this out the next morning, he withdrew the order. We later discovered it had already been carried out.<br \/>\n<\/i><span id=\"Post-Trujillo_.281961.E2.80.931996.29\"><\/span><span id=\"Post-Trujillo_(1961\u20131996)\" class=\"mw-headline\"><strong>Post-Trujillo (1961\u20131996).<\/strong>\u00a0<\/span>Trujillo was assassinated by Dominican dissidents in Chicago\u00a0gangland-style\u00a0on May 30, 1961.\u00a0Although the dissidents possessed Dominican-made\u00a0San Crist\u00f3bal\u00a0submachine guns, they symbolically used U.S.-made\u00a0M-1\u00a0carbines supplied by the United States\u00a0Central Intelligence Agency\u00a0(CIA).<br \/>\nRamfis Trujillo, the dictator&#8217;s son, remained in de facto control of the government for the next six months through his position as commander of the armed forces. Trujillo&#8217;s brothers, Hector Bienvenido and Jose Arismendi Trujillo, returned to the country and began immediately to plot against President Balaguer. On November 18, 1961, as a planned coup became more evident, U.S. Secretary of State\u00a0Dean Rusk\u00a0issued a warning that the United States would not &#8220;remain idle&#8221; if the Trujillos attempted to &#8220;reassert dictatorial domination&#8221; over the Dominican Republic. Following this warning, and the arrival of a fourteen-vessel U.S. naval task force within sight of Santo Domingo, Ramfis and his uncles fled the country on November 19 with $200 million from the Dominican treasury.<br \/>\nOn December 28, 1962, the Dominican military suppressed a rebellion in Palma Sola, burning six hundred people to death by a\u00a0napalm\u00a0airstrike.<br \/>\nIn February 1963, a democratically elected government under leftist\u00a0Juan Bosch\u00a0took office but it was overthrown in September. On April 24, 1965, after 19 months of military rule, a pro-Bosch revolt broke out in Santo Domingo.\u00a0The pro-Bosch forces called themselves Constitutionalists. The revolution took on the dimensions of a civil war when conservative military forces struck back against the Constitutionalists on April 25. These conservative forces called themselves Loyalists. Despite tank assaults and bombing runs by Loyalist forces, the Constitutionalists held their positions in the capital. By April 26, armed civilians outnumbered the original rebel military regulars. Radio Santo Domingo, now fully under rebel control, began to call for more violent actions and for killing of all the policemen.<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-Greenberg_93-4\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>On April 28, U.S. President\u00a0Lyndon Johnson, concerned that communists might take over the revolt and create a &#8220;second Cuba,&#8221; sent 42,000 troops into Santo Domingo, in\u00a0Operation Powerpack. &#8220;We don&#8217;t propose to sit here in a rocking chair with our hands folded and let the Communist set up any government in the Western Hemisphere,&#8221; Johnson said.\u00a0The forces were soon joined by comparatively small contingents from the\u00a0Organization of American States\u00a0(OAS).\u00a0The Loyalists used the U.S. presence to deploy its forces and attack Constitutionalists. As a result, Loyalist forces destroyed most Constitutionalist bases and captured the rebel radio station, effectively ending the war. On May 13, Loyalist forces launched\u00a0Operation Limpieza\u00a0and captured the northern part of Santo Domingo. Many black civilians were killed during the operation. A cease-fire was declared on May 21.<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-Pedraja_122-0\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>The U.S. began withdrawing some of its troops by late May. However, Col.

U.S. and OAS troops remained in the country for over a year and left after supervising elections in 1966 won by\u00a0Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer. He had been Trujillo&#8217;s last puppet-president.<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-Encarta_45-5\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>Balaguer remained in power as president for 12 years. His tenure was a period of repression of human rights and civil liberties, ostensibly to keep pro-Castro or pro-communist parties out of power; 11,000 persons were killed, tortured or\u00a0forcibly disappeared.\u00a0His rule was criticized for a growing disparity between rich and poor. It was, however, praised for an ambitious infrastructure program, which included the construction of large housing projects, sports complexes, theaters, museums, aqueducts, roads, highways, and the massive\u00a0Columbus Lighthouse, completed in 1992 during a later tenure. During Balaguer&#8217;s administration, the Dominican military forced Haitians to cut sugarcane on\u00a0Dominican sugar plantations.<br \/>\nIn September 1977, twelve Cuban-manned\u00a0MiG-21s\u00a0conducted strafing flights over Puerto Plata to warn Balaguer against intercepting Cuban warships\u00a0headed to or returning from Angola.\u00a0Hurricane David\u00a0hit the Dominican Republic in August 1979, which left upwards of 2,000 people dead and 200,000 homeless.\u00a0The hurricane caused over $1 billion in damage.<br \/>\nIn 1978, Balaguer was succeeded in the presidency by opposition candidate\u00a0Antonio Guzm\u00e1n Fern\u00e1ndez, of the\u00a0Dominican Revolutionary Party\u00a0(PRD). Another PRD win in 1982 followed, under\u00a0Salvador Jorge Blanco. Balaguer regained the presidency in 1986 and was re-elected in 1990 and 1994, this last time just defeating PRD candidate\u00a0Jos\u00e9 Francisco Pe\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, a former mayor of Santo Domingo.<br \/>\nDuring this period, the international community condemned the Dominican government for their continued exploitation of Haitian sugar cane workers; it had been alleged that thousands of these workers had essentially been put into slavery, forced to do backbreaking work under the supervision of armed guards.<br \/>\nThe 1994 elections were flawed, bringing on international pressure, to which Balaguer responded by scheduling another presidential contest in 1996. Balaguer was not a candidate. The PSRC candidate was his Vice President\u00a0Jacinto Peynado Garrigosa.<br \/>\n<span id=\"1996.E2.80.93present\"><\/span><span id=\"1996\u2013present\" class=\"mw-headline\"><strong>1996\u2013present<\/strong>.\u00a0<\/span>Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez\u00a0was president from 1996\u20132000 &amp; 2004\u20132012.<br \/>\nIn the 1996 presidential election,\u00a0Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez\u00a0achieved the first-ever win for the\u00a0Dominican Liberation Party\u00a0(PLD),\u00a0which Bosch had founded in 1973 after leaving the PRD (which he also had founded).

Fern\u00e1ndez oversaw a fast-growing economy: growth averaged 7.7% per year, unemployment fell, and there were stable exchange and inflation rates.\u00a0His administration supported the process of modernizing the judicial system, making transparent the creation of an independent Supreme Court of Justice. Efforts were also made to reform and modernize the other state bodies. In addition, relations with Cuba were reestablished and the Free Trade Agreement with Central America was signed, which was the genesis for the signing of DR-CAFTA.<br \/>\nIn 2000, the PRD&#8217;s\u00a0Hip\u00f3lito Mej\u00eda\u00a0won the election. This was a time of economic troubles. Nevertheless, his government was marked by major economic and social reforms, apart from a decentralization of the national budget. Among the laws created in this period are the Social Security, the Monetary and Financial Code, the Stock Market, Electricity, Electronic Commerce, the Police Law, the Environment, Public Health, the Chamber of Accounts, the Insurance Law, Administrative Independence and Budgetary of the Legislative Power and Judicial Power; in addition, creation of the Santo Domingo Province and its municipalities, a larger budget for municipalities, as well as other laws. This meant in the 2002 elections, obtaining a congressional and municipal majority. During this period, great sports structures were built for the 2003 Pan American Games. Under Mej\u00eda, the Dominican Republic participated in the US-led coalition, as part of the Multinational Brigade Plus Ultra, during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, suffering no casualties. In 2004, the country withdrew its approximately 300 soldiers from Iraq. The government of President Mej\u00eda had to negotiate the Free Trade Agreement with the United States, the main trading partner. He also promoted various commercial measures, popularly called &#8220;Economic Package&#8221;. This &#8220;package&#8221; was accompanied by a series of social measures, such as aid to agricultural producers, subsidies to electricity rates, construction of streets, sidewalks, local roads, etc., as well as subsidies to poor families whose children attended schools, as well as the creation of new taxes and increases in existing ones.<br \/>\nIn 2003 the bankruptcy of three banking entities whose savers were protected by the government led to inflation. This caused a severe economic crisis accompanied by the devaluation of the currency and capital outflows, instability that led to the bankruptcy of many companies. With the congressional majority obtained in 2002, President Mej\u00eda promoted a constitutional reform that restored the possibility of presidential reelection, which had been abolished in 1994 at the request of his own party. This reform caused problems within his party causing a division within its main leaders. Mej\u00eda was defeated in his re-election effort in 2004 by Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez of the PLD who won with 57.11% of the votes the presidential elections. At the beginning of his second presidential term, he made an effort to combat the economic crisis, reestablishing macroeconomic stability, through the reduction of the dollar exchange rate and the return of confidence in the economy among other measures. However, his administrations was accused of corruption. President Fern\u00e1ndez&#8217;s management consisted of improving Santo Domingo&#8217;s collective transport system, the first Metro line was built; the completion of the main communication routes to the country&#8217;s tourist poles; the construction of new schools or the construction of more classrooms, as well as the provision of computer centers with modern computers and Internet to the communities in coordination with schools, churches or clubs. It continued its program of modernization of the state, strengthening the formulation and execution of the budget and promoting laws to make the public acquisition of goods and services transparent.<br \/>\nIn 2008, Fern\u00e1ndez was elected for a third term.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ussdnote_132-1\" class=\"reference\">[130]<\/sup>\u00a0Fern\u00e1ndez and the PLD are credited with initiatives that have moved the country forward technologically, on the other hand, his administrations have been accused of corruption.\u00a0Danilo Medina\u00a0of the PLD was elected president in 2012 and re-elected in 2016.

It shares the island roughly at a 2:1 ratio with\u00a0Haiti, the north-to-south (though somewhat irregular) border between the two countries being 376\u00a0km (234\u00a0mi).\u00a0To the north and north-west lie\u00a0The Bahamas\u00a0and the\u00a0Turks and Caicos Islands, and to the east, across the\u00a0Mona Passage, the US Commonwealth of\u00a0Puerto Rico. The country&#8217;s area is reported variously as 48,442\u00a0km<sup>2<\/sup>\u00a0making it the second-largest country in the\u00a0Antilles, after\u00a0Cuba. The Dominican Republic&#8217;s capital and largest city\u00a0Santo Domingo\u00a0is on the southern coast.<br \/>\nThe Dominican Republic has four important mountain ranges. The most northerly is the\u00a0<i>Cordillera Septentrional<\/i>\u00a0(&#8220;Northern Mountain Range&#8221;), which extends from the northwestern coastal town of\u00a0Monte Cristi, near the Haitian border, to the\u00a0Saman\u00e1 Peninsula\u00a0in the east, running parallel to the Atlantic coast. The highest range in the Dominican Republic\u00a0\u2013 indeed, in the whole of the West Indies\u00a0\u2013 is the\u00a0<i>Cordillera Central<\/i>\u00a0(&#8220;Central Mountain Range&#8221;). It gradually bends southwards and finishes near the town of\u00a0Azua, on the Caribbean coast. In the Cordillera Central are the four highest peaks in the Caribbean:\u00a0Pico Duarte\u00a0(3,098 metres or 10,164 feet above sea level),<sup id=\"cite_ref-CIADemo_5-17\" class=\"reference\">[4]<\/sup>\u00a0La Pelona (3,094 metres or 10,151 feet), La Rucilla (3,049 metres or 10,003 feet), and Pico Yaque (2,760 metres or 9,055 feet). In the southwest corner of the country, south of the Cordillera Central, there are two other ranges: the more northerly of the two is the\u00a0<i>Sierra de Neiba<\/i>, while in the south the\u00a0<i>Sierra de Bahoruco<\/i>\u00a0is a continuation of the\u00a0Massif de la Selle\u00a0in Haiti. There are other, minor mountain ranges, such as the\u00a0<i>Cordillera Oriental<\/i>\u00a0(&#8220;Eastern Mountain Range&#8221;),\u00a0<i>Sierra Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda<\/i>,\u00a0<i>Sierra de Yamas\u00e1<\/i>, and\u00a0<i>Sierra de Saman\u00e1<\/i>.<br \/>\nBetween the Central and Northern mountain ranges lies the rich and fertile\u00a0<em>Cibao\u00a0valley.<\/em> This major valley is home to the cities of\u00a0Santiago\u00a0and\u00a0La Vega\u00a0and most of the farming areas of the nation. Rather less productive are the semi-arid San Juan Valley, south of the Central Cordillera, and the Neiba Valley, tucked between the Sierra de Neiba and the Sierra de Bahoruco. Much of the land around the\u00a0Enriquillo\u00a0Basin is below sea level, with a hot, arid, desert-like environment. There are other smaller valleys in the mountains, such as the\u00a0Constanza,\u00a0Jarabacoa,\u00a0Villa Altagracia, and\u00a0Bonao\u00a0valleys.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0<i>Llano Costero del Caribe<\/i>\u00a0(&#8220;Caribbean Coastal Plain&#8221;) is the largest of the plains in the Dominican Republic. Stretching north and east of Santo Domingo, it contains many sugar plantations in the\u00a0savannahs. West of Santo Domingo its width is reduced to 10 kilometres (6.2\u00a0mi) as it hugs the coast, finishing at the mouth of the Ocoa River. Another large plain is the\u00a0<i>Plena de Azua<\/i>\u00a0(&#8220;Azua Plain&#8221;), a very arid region in\u00a0Azua Province. A few other small coastal plains are on the northern coast and in the\u00a0Pedernales\u00a0Peninsula.<br \/>\nFour major rivers drain the numerous mountains of the Dominican Republic. The\u00a0Yaque del Norte\u00a0is the longest and most important Dominican river. It carries excess water down from the Cibao Valley and empties into Monte Cristi Bay, in the northwest. Likewise, the\u00a0Yuna River\u00a0serves the Vega Real and empties into Saman\u00e1 Bay, in the northeast. Drainage of the San Juan Valley is provided by the San Juan River,\u00a0tributary\u00a0of the\u00a0Yaque del Sur, which empties into the Caribbean, in the south. The\u00a0Artibonito\u00a0is the longest river of Hispaniola and flows westward into Haiti.<br \/>\nThere are numerous waterfalls across Dominican Republic. In the image the Salto del Lim\u00f3n<br \/>\nThere are many lakes and coastal lagoons. The largest lake is\u00a0Enriquillo, a\u00a0salt lake\u00a0at 45 metres (148\u00a0ft) below sea level, the lowest elevation in the Caribbean.\u00a0Other important lakes are\u00a0Laguna de Rinc\u00f3n\u00a0or Cabral, with\u00a0fresh water, and\u00a0Laguna de Oviedo, a lagoon with\u00a0brackish water.<br \/>\nThere are many small offshore islands and\u00a0cays\u00a0that form part of the Dominican territory. The two largest islands near shore are\u00a0Saona, in the southeast, and\u00a0Beata, in the southwest. Smaller islands include the\u00a0Cayos Siete Hermanos,\u00a0Isla Cabra,\u00a0Cayo Jackson,\u00a0Cayo Lim\u00f3n,\u00a0Cayo Levantado,\u00a0Cayo la Bocaina,\u00a0Catalanita,\u00a0Cayo Pisaje\u00a0and\u00a0Isla Alto Velo. To the north, at distances of 100\u2013200 kilometres (62\u2013124\u00a0mi), are three extensive, largely submerged\u00a0banks, which geographically are a southeast continuation of\u00a0the Bahamas:\u00a0Navidad Bank,\u00a0Silver Bank, and\u00a0Mouchoir Bank. Navidad Bank and Silver Bank have been officially claimed by the Dominican Republic.\u00a0Isla Cabritos\u00a0lies within\u00a0Lago Enriquillo.<br \/>\nThe Dominican Republic is located near fault action in the Caribbean. In 1946, it suffered\u00a0a magnitude 8.1 earthquake\u00a0off the northeast coast, triggering a\u00a0tsunami\u00a0that killed about 1,800, mostly in coastal communities. Caribbean countries and the United States have collaborated to create tsunami warning systems and are mapping high-risk low-lying areas.<br \/>\nThe country is home to five terrestrial ecoregions:\u00a0Hispaniolan moist forests,\u00a0Hispaniolan dry forests,\u00a0Hispaniolan pine forests,\u00a0Enriquillo wetlands, and\u00a0Greater Antilles mangroves.\u00a0It had a 2018\u00a0Forest Landscape Integrity Index\u00a0mean score of 4.18\/10, ranking it 134th globally out of 172 countries.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dominican Republic \u2013 East, South (Santo Domingo, La Romana, Barahona) March 22-25, 2022.
