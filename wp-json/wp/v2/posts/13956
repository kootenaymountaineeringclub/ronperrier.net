It is a lovely moderate hike with good views.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Valhalla Mountain Touring.<\/strong> Ruby Ridge is in the 19,000 acre tenure of Valhalla Mountain Touring (vmt.ca), a snow cat operation in the winter and hiking destination in the summer. The lodge is at a relatively low elevation (1721m). The two-story main building was constructed in 1998 by the Caton family and is now run by Jasmin Caton, an ACGM certified ski and mountain guide. The lodge has 7 bedrooms, 24\/7 electricity supplied by a micro-hydro system, good wireless internet, hot and cold water and a separate sauna building.<br \/>\nWinter: Snow cat access means in\/out no matter the weather and no weight limits. Due to lack or wind, lots of north facing terrain and many drainages, there is almost always good skiing with little sun crusting. The best skiing is mid winter powder in avalanche paths. As Jasmin has children, there is a strong emphasis on family skiing. However the alpine is hard to access with 1000\u2019 of trees to negotiate to get to tree line.<br \/>\nThe main skiing areas are Ruby Bowl, Shannon Lake, Little Sister Ridge, and Caribou. It is a long ways to get to the best terrain at Shannon Lake and Caribou. Farther yet are the NE face of Vingolf and the ridge south of Caribou.<br \/>\nSummer. VMT accesses all the hikes close by. Rugged, Big Sister and Ruby Ridge are out the door of the lodge. Shannon Lake (up Hess Creek) and Caribou Ridge (up the headwaters of Shannon Creek) have considerably longer access.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rating:<\/strong> \u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666<strong>\u25ca<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Location:<\/strong> South of Rugged and Big Sister peaks, the two mountains at the north end of the Valhallas and visible from Highway 6.
