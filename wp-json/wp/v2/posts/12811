The country sees few tourists: in 2016, there were an estimated 13,000 visitors to the country. The equator lies immediately south of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 Island, passing through an islet named Ilh\u00e9u das Rolas.<br \/>\nThe Portuguese were the first settlers of these previously uninhabited islands in the late 15th century. Attracting settlers proved difficult, however, and most of the earliest inhabitants were \u201cundesirables\u201d sent from Portugal, mostly Jews. The Portuguese brought in slaves from Africa to cultivate sugar, coffee and cocoa. Nearly all of its current residents are descended from people from different countries taken to the islands by the Portuguese from 1470 onwards.<br \/>\nIn 1990, STP was one of the first African nations to undertake democratic reforms, and it has maintained democratic government since then with only a one-week interruption. The country\u2019s culture, customs, and music fuse European and African influences. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9ans are known for \u00fassua and socop\u00e9 rhythms, while Pr\u00edncipe is home to the d\u00eaxa beat. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe is a nation of about 202,000 people (2018).<\/p>\n<p>Trees cover almost 90% of the islands. The main crop on S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 is cocoa, representing about 95% of agricultural exports. Other export crops include copra, palm kernels, and coffee.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Visa.\u00a0<\/strong>Several African countries, US and Europe may enter without a visa for up to 15 days.

Although independence was achieved in 1975, democratic reforms were not instituted until the late 1980s, and the first free elections were held in 1991.<br \/>\n<\/span><strong>Economy.<\/strong> This small poor island economy has become increasingly dependent on cocoa since independence in 1975. However, cocoa production has substantially declined because of drought and mismanagement. The resulting shortage of cocoa for export has created a persistent balance-of-payments problem. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 has to import all fuels, most manufactured goods, consumer goods, and a substantial amount of food. Over the years, it has been unable to service its foreign debt and has had to depend on concessional aid and debt rescheduling. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 benefited from $200 million in debt relief in December 2000 under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) program.<\/p>\n<p><em>Getting here was an adventure. From Algiers, I flew on Air France via Paris CDG to Douala, Cameroon, a long-ago booked flight on the West Africa Tour. As I had been to Cameroon previously, I had cancelled from that expensive tour and decided to go to Sao Tome, so was transiting Douala.<\/em><br \/>\n<em>The Douala Airport was a disaster. I had not printed out my flights which was required to pass a security guard. The airport had no wifi so I couldn&#8217;t access the flight schedule. I whined and he finally let me through. Cameroon required a PCR which I didn&#8217;t have as I hoped it would not be necessary with a transit. I wrote transit and actually got a stamp and then had a rapid test (negative). Immigration was long and my passport was held by the police as again I didn&#8217;t have a printed flight schedule. I went to a cell phone store and had it printed. The transit visa required an entire passport page but allowed one to leave the airport for up to 72 hours and stay in a hotel. I didn&#8217;t want to do that so stayed in the VIP lounge in the airport for 20,000 CFA (~31\u20ac). It is very small and consists of a leather couch and love seat (and doesn&#8217;t normally allow sleeping) but had great air conditioning in this oppressive humid heat. I actually slept well.<\/em><br \/>\n<em>My flight schedule with Asky Airlines involved two transfers (Lome, Benin and Libreville, Gabon).<\/em><br \/>\n5\/11\/22 DLA-LFW @10:55-11:40 KP35<br \/>\n<em>In the transit area of Lome Airport, I smoked half a cigarette in the bathroom. I appreciate that this contravened the rules &#8211; there were actually no smoking signs on each cubicle door. As a heavily addicted smoker, I have smoked in literally hundreds of bathrooms at airports where there are no smoking areas.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>I believe that a carefully orchestrated plot exists in the airport. Are there cameras over each cubicle? I say that as there was no bathroom attendant when I entered, but one appeared instantly after I left the bathroom. He immediately called the police who escorted me to the second floor outside a bathroom to wait for the &#8220;chief&#8221;. He was very threatening and demanded to cancel my flights.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>This extreme reaction is part of the scam. Just for smoking half a cigarette, I would lose my upcoming two flights\u00a0to Sao Tome, would have to stay in Lome until a new flight was possible (I had no visa as I was transiting), would have to pay for booked accommodation etc etc. The eventual\u00a0cost would have been over $1000.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>I whined that this was a ridiculous penalty. I was taken into the handicapped bathroom and the threat continued with another policeman present. He didn&#8217;t specifically ask for money until I mentioned it but then money became the issue. I only had about 14,000 CFA on my person. He wanted $100. As that is all I had, he took that. Surprisingly, he gave me back my cigarettes and lighter.<br \/>\n<\/em>LFW-LBV @1:55-4:55 KP60<br \/>\nLBV-TMS @17:35-17:35 KP60<br \/>\n9\/11\/22 TMS-LBV @7:00-9:00 KP61<br \/>\nLBV-LFW @9:40-10:40 KP61<br \/>\nLFW-DLA @12:20-15:05 KP34<br \/>\nSo I was back in Douala with another transit to CAR the next day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>S\u0100O TOM\u00c9 CITY <\/strong>(<em>Saint Thomas<\/em>) \u2013 the capital and largest city, has a 15th-century cathedral, the national museum, and the Presidential Palaceis.

Its summit is 663 m (2,175 ft) above sea level, and it rises about 370 m (1,210 ft) over the surrounding terrain. The volcanic plug was formed by magma solidifying in the vent of an active volcano. The nearest village is\u00a0Vila Clotilde, 3\u00a0km to the east.<br \/>\nThe volcanic plug is quite a recent phenomenon, having formed as part of the\u00a0Cameroon line\u00a0of\u00a0volcanoes\u00a0roughly three and a half million years ago in the\u00a0Pliocene. Its composition is mainly\u00a0phonolite (also called clinkstone in vernacular English).<br \/>\nThe moss growing on the rocks due to high moisture content, and the presence of snakes, make climbing here very difficult. The first attempt to climb Pico C\u00e3o Grande was in 1975 by a Portuguese team of climbers, and the first successful climb was completed by a Japanese group of climbers in Feb 1991.<br \/>\nIn June 2016, Gareth Leah, from England, and Sergio Almada, from Mexico, established a new bolt-protected route on the peak. The pair spent four weeks on the peak producing a route which they named Nubivagant (&#8220;ascent into the clouds&#8221;). The route is 15 pitches (455 metres) in length and is graded F8b (5.13d). They climbed all but three pitches clean. The route is both extremely long and technically very demanding, and their climb was plagued with difficulties, including snakebites and blown battery chargers. The most difficult portions of the climb are in the first 100 meters, after which the difficulty drops considerably.<br \/>\nIn July 2018, the Spanish brothers Iker and Eneko Pou completed a multi-day team redpoint ascent of a new route. They established the route ground up and without use of aid or removable bolts. The route is called Leve Leve and graded F8b+ (5.14a).<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"hCL kVc L4E MIw\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\" src=\"https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/ed\/ea\/05\/edea05a16b41f7229dc7fef69c942019.jpg\" alt=\"Pico do C\u00e3o Grande (Big Dog Peak) - Island in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, off the coast of Gabon Beautiful Places To Visit, Places To See, Places To Travel, Nature Pictures, Cool Pictures, Best River Cruises, Berg, Giant Tree, Usa Tours\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>SAO TOME (EPS report)<\/strong><br \/>\nA beautiful island but very poor.
