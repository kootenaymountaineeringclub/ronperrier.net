Its constituent republics declared independence, despite unresolved tensions between ethnic minorities in the new countries, fuelling the wars.<\/p>\n<p>Most of the wars ended through peace accords, involving full international recognition of new states, but with a massive human cost and economic damage to the region. Initially the\u00a0Yugoslav People&#8217;s Army\u00a0(JNA) sought to preserve the unity of the whole of Yugoslavia by crushing the secessionist governments, but it increasingly came under the influence of the Serbian government of\u00a0Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, which evoked\u00a0Serbian nationalist\u00a0rhetoric and was willing to use the Yugoslav cause to preserve the unity of Serbs in one state. As a result, the JNA began to lose Slovenes, Croats, Kosovar Albanians, Bosniaks, and ethnic Macedonians, and effectively became a Serb army.\u00a0According to a 1994\u00a0United Nations\u00a0report, the Serb side did not aim to restore Yugoslavia, but to create a &#8220;Greater Serbia&#8221; from parts of Croatia and Bosnia.\u00a0Other\u00a0irredentist\u00a0movements have also been brought into connection with the wars, such as &#8220;Greater Albania&#8221; (from\u00a0Kosovo, though it was abandoned following international diplomacy\u00a0and &#8220;Greater Croatia&#8221; (from parts of\u00a0Herzegovina, until 1994 when the\u00a0Washington Agreement\u00a0ended it).<\/p>\n<p>Often described as Europe&#8217;s deadliest conflicts since\u00a0World War II, the wars were marked by many\u00a0war crimes, including\u00a0genocide,\u00a0crimes against humanity\u00a0and\u00a0rape. The\u00a0Bosnian genocide\u00a0was the first European crime to be formally judged as genocidal in character since World War II, and many key individual participants were subsequently charged with war crimes.\u00a0The\u00a0International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia\u00a0(ICTY) was established by the UN to prosecute these crimes. According to the\u00a0International Center for Transitional Justice, the Yugoslav Wars resulted in the death of 140,000 people. The\u00a0Humanitarian Law Center\u00a0estimates that in the conflicts in the former Yugoslav republics at least 130,000 people were killed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>NAMING<\/strong><br \/>\nThe war(s) have alternatively been called: &#8220;Wars in the\u00a0Balkans&#8221; (although the wars only affected the west side of the Balkans as well as areas outside it (within\u00a0Central Europe), &#8220;Wars\/conflicts in the former Yugoslavia&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND<\/strong><br \/>\nClear ethnic conflict between the Yugoslav peoples only became prominent in the 20th century, beginning with tensions over the constitution of the\u00a0Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes\u00a0in the early 1920s and escalating into violence between Serbs and Croats in the late 1920s after the assassination of Croatian politician\u00a0Stjepan Radi\u0107. During World War II the Croatian\u00a0Usta\u0161e\u00a0committed a number of atrocities\u00a0against the Serbs, as did their Serbian\u00a0Chetnik\u00a0opponents\u00a0against the Croats and Bosniaks. The Yugoslav Partisan movement was able to appeal to all groups, including Serbs, Croats, and Bosniaks.\u00a0In Serbia and Serb-dominated territories, violent confrontations occurred, particularly between nationalists and non-nationalists who criticized the Serbian government and the Serb political entities in Bosnia and Croatia.\u00a0Serbs who publicly opposed the nationalist political climate during the Yugoslav wars were reportedly harassed, threatened, or killed.<\/p>\n<p>The nation of\u00a0Yugoslavia\u00a0was created in the aftermath of World War I, and it was mostly composed of\u00a0South Slavic\u00a0Christians, though the nation also had a substantial Muslim minority. This nation lasted from 1918 to 1941, when it was\u00a0invaded by the Axis powers\u00a0during World War II, which provided support to the\u00a0Usta\u0161e\u00a0(founded in 1929), which conducted a genocidal campaign against Serbs,\u00a0Jews and Roma\u00a0inside its territory and the Chetniks, who also conducted their own campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide against ethnic Croats and Bosniaks, while also supporting the reinstatement of the Serbian royals. In 1945, the\u00a0Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\u00a0(SFRY) was established under\u00a0Josip Broz Tito,\u00a0who maintained a strongly authoritarian leadership that suppressed\u00a0nationalism.\u00a0After Tito&#8217;s death in 1980, relations among the six republics of the SFRY deteriorated.\u00a0Slovenia\u00a0and\u00a0Croatia\u00a0desired greater autonomy within the Yugoslav confederation, while Serbia sought to strengthen federal authority. As it became clearer that there was no solution agreeable to all parties, Slovenia and Croatia moved toward secession. Although tensions in Yugoslavia had been mounting since the early 1980s, events in 1990 proved decisive. In the midst of economic hardship, Yugoslavia was facing rising nationalism among its various ethnic groups. By the early 1990s, there was no effective authority at the federal level. The Federal Presidency consisted of the representatives of the six republics, two provinces and the Yugoslav People&#8217;s Army, and the communist leadership was divided along national lines.<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0War Crimes Tribunal\u00a0accused\u00a0Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 of &#8220;attempting to create a\u00a0Greater Serbia&#8221;&#8216;, a\u00a0Serbian\u00a0state encompassing the Serb-populated areas of Croatia and Bosnia, and achieved by\u00a0forcibly removing\u00a0non-Serbs from large geographical areas through the commission of criminal activity.<\/p>\n<p>The representatives of\u00a0Vojvodina,\u00a0Kosovo\u00a0and\u00a0Montenegro\u00a0were replaced with loyalists of the President of Serbia,\u00a0Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107. Serbia secured four out of eight federal presidency votes and was able to heavily influence decision-making at the federal level, since all the other Yugoslav republics only had one vote. While Slovenia and Croatia wanted to allow a multi-party system, Serbia, led by Milo\u0161evi\u0107, demanded an even more centralized federation and Serbia&#8217;s dominant role in it.\u00a0At the\u00a014th Extraordinary Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia\u00a0in January 1990, the\u00a0Serbian-dominated assembly agreed to abolish the single-party system; however, Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, the head of the Serbian Party branch (League of Communists of Serbia) used his influence to block and vote-down all other proposals from the\u00a0Croatian\u00a0and\u00a0Slovene\u00a0party delegates. This prompted the Croatian and Slovene delegations to walk out and thus the break-up of the party,\u00a0a symbolic event representing the end of &#8220;brotherhood and unity&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Upon Croatia and Slovenia declaring independence in 1991, the Yugoslav federal government attempted to forcibly halt the impending breakup of the country, with Yugoslav Prime Minister\u00a0Ante Markovi\u0107\u00a0declaring the secessions of Slovenia and Croatia to be illegal and contrary to the constitution of Yugoslavia, and declared support for the Yugoslav People&#8217;s Army to secure the integral unity of Yugoslavia.<\/p>\n<p>According to Stephen A. Hart, author of\u00a0Partisans: War in the Balkans 1941\u20131945, the ethnically mixed region of\u00a0Dalmatia\u00a0held close and amicable relations between the Croats and Serbs who lived there in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many early proponents of a united Yugoslavia came from this region, such as\u00a0Ante Trumbi\u0107, a Croat from Dalmatia. However, by the time of the outbreak of the Yugoslav Wars, any hospitable relations between Croats and Serbs in Dalmatia had broken down, with Dalmatian Serbs fighting on the side of the\u00a0Republic of Serbian Krajina.<\/p>\n<p>Even though the policies throughout the entire socialist period of Yugoslavia seemed to have been the same (namely that all Serbs should live in one state), Dejan Guzina argues that &#8220;different contexts in each of the subperiods of socialist Serbia and Yugoslavia yielded entirely different results (e.g., in favor of Yugoslavia, or in favour of a\u00a0Greater Serbia)&#8221;. He assumes that the Serbian policy changed from conservative\u2013socialist at the beginning to\u00a0xenophobic\u00a0nationalist in the late 1980s and 1990s.<\/p>\n<p><strong>WARS<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Ten-Day War<\/strong> (1991). The first of the conflicts, known as the Ten-Day War, was initiated by the JNA (Yugoslav People&#8217;s Army) on 26 June 1991 after the secession of Slovenia from the federation on 25 June 1991.<br \/>\nInitially, the federal government ordered the Yugoslav People&#8217;s Army to secure border crossings in Slovenia. Slovenian police and\u00a0Slovenian Territorial Defence\u00a0blockaded barracks and roads, leading to stand-offs and limited skirmishes around the republic. After several dozen casualties, the limited conflict was stopped through negotiation at\u00a0Brioni\u00a0on 7 July 1991, when Slovenia and Croatia agreed to a three-month moratorium on secession. The Federal army completely withdrew from Slovenia by 26 October 1991.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Croatian War of Independence<\/strong> (1991\u20131995)<br \/>\nFighting in Croatia had begun weeks prior to the Ten-Day War in Slovenia. The Croatian War of Independence began when\u00a0Serbs in Croatia, who were opposed to\u00a0Croatian independence, announced their secession from Croatia.<br \/>\nIn the\u00a01990 parliamentary elections\u00a0in Croatia,\u00a0Franjo Tu\u0111man\u00a0became the first\u00a0President of Croatia. He promoted nationalist policies and had a primary goal of the establishment of an independent Croatia. The new government proposed\u00a0constitutional changes, reinstated the traditional\u00a0Croatian flag\u00a0and\u00a0coat of arms, and removed the term &#8220;Socialist&#8221; from the title of the republic.\u00a0In an attempt to counter changes made to the constitution, local Serb politicians organized a referendum on &#8220;Serb sovereignty and autonomy&#8221; in August 1990. Their boycott escalated into an insurrection in areas populated by ethnic Serbs, mostly around Knin, known as the\u00a0Log Revolution. Local police in Knin sided with the growing Serbian insurgency, while many government employees, mostly police where commanding positions were mainly held by Serbs and Communists, lost their jobs.\u00a0The new Croatian constitution was ratified in December 1990, and the Serb National Council formed\u00a0SAO Krajina, a self-proclaimed Serbian autonomous region.<br \/>\nEthnic tensions rose, fuelled by\u00a0propaganda\u00a0in both Croatia and Serbia. On 2 May 1991, one of the first armed clashes between Serb paramilitaries and Croatian police occurred in the\u00a0Battle of Borovo Selo. On 19 May an\u00a0independence referendum\u00a0was held, which was largely boycotted by\u00a0Croatian Serbs, and the majority voted in favour of the independence of Croatia. Croatia declared independence and dissolved its association with Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991. Due to the\u00a0Brioni Agreement, a three-month moratorium was placed on the implementation of the decision that ended on 8 October.<br \/>\nThe armed incidents of early 1991 escalated into an all-out war over the summer, with fronts formed around the areas of the breakaway SAO Krajina. The JNA had disarmed the Territorial Units of Slovenia and Croatia prior to the declaration of independence, at the behest of Serbian President Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107. This was aggravated further by an arms embargo, imposed by the UN on Yugoslavia. The JNA was ostensibly ideologically unitarian, but its officer corps was predominantly staffed by Serbs or Montenegrins (70 percent). As a result, the JNA opposed Croatian independence and sided with the Croatian Serb rebels. The Croatian Serb rebels were unaffected by the embargo as they had the support of and access to supplies of the JNA. By mid-July 1991, the JNA moved an estimated 70,000 troops to Croatia. The fighting rapidly escalated, eventually spanning hundreds of square kilometres from western Slavonia through\u00a0Banija\u00a0to Dalmatia.<br \/>\nBorder regions faced direct attacks from forces within Serbia and Montenegro. In August 1991, the\u00a0Battle of Vukovar\u00a0began, where fierce fighting took place with around 1,800 Croat fighters blocking JNA&#8217;s advance into Slavonia. By the end of October, the town was almost completely devastated from land shelling and air bombardment. The\u00a0Siege of Dubrovnik\u00a0started in October with the shelling of\u00a0UNESCO\u00a0world heritage site\u00a0Dubrovnik, where the international press was criticised for focusing on the city&#8217;s architectural heritage, instead of reporting the destruction of Vukovar in which many civilians were killed.\u00a0On 18 November 1991 the battle of Vukovar ended after the city ran out of ammunition.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Ov\u010dara massacre\u00a0occurred shortly after Vukovar&#8217;s capture by the JNA.\u00a0Meanwhile, control over central Croatia was seized by Croatian Serb forces in conjunction with the JNA Corps from Bosnia and Herzegovina, under the leadership of\u00a0Ratko Mladi\u0107.<br \/>\nIn January 1992, the\u00a0Vance Plan\u00a0proclaimed UN controlled (UNPA) zones for\u00a0Serbs\u00a0in territory claimed by Serbian rebels as the\u00a0Republic of Serbian Krajina\u00a0(RSK) and brought an end to major military operations, though sporadic artillery attacks on Croatian cities and occasional intrusions of Croatian forces into UNPA zones continued until 1995. The fighting in Croatia ended in mid-1995, after\u00a0Operation Flash\u00a0and\u00a0Operation Storm. At the end of these operations, Croatia had reclaimed all of its territory except the UNPA Sector East portion of Slavonia, bordering Serbia. Most of the Serb population in the reclaimed areas became refugees. The areas of &#8220;Sector East&#8221;, unaffected by the Croatian military operations, came under UN administration (UNTAES), and were reintegrated to Croatia in 1998 under the terms of the\u00a0Erdut Agreement.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bosnian War<\/strong> (1992\u20131995)<br \/>\nIn early 1992, a conflict engulfed\u00a0Bosnia and Herzegovina\u00a0as it also declared independence from the rump Yugoslavia. The war was predominantly a territorial conflict between the\u00a0Bosniaks, who wanted to preserve the territorial integrity of the newly independent\u00a0Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb\u00a0proto-state Republika Srpska\u00a0and the self-proclaimed\u00a0Herzeg-Bosnia, which were led and supplied by Serbia and Croatia respectively, reportedly with a goal of the\u00a0partition of Bosnia, which would leave only a small part of land for the Bosniaks.\u00a0On 18 December 1992, the\u00a0United Nations General Assembly\u00a0issued resolution 47\/121 in which it condemned Serbian and Montenegrin forces for trying to acquire more territories by force.<br \/>\nThe Yugoslav armed forces had disintegrated into a largely Serb-dominated military force. The JNA opposed the Bosnian-majority led government&#8217;s agenda for independence, and along with other armed nationalist Serb militant forces attempted to prevent Bosnian citizens from voting in the 1992 referendum on independence.\u00a0They failed to persuade people not to vote, and instead the intimidating atmosphere combined with a Serb boycott of the vote resulted in a resounding 99% vote in support for independence.<br \/>\nOn 19 June 1992, the war in Bosnia broke out, though the\u00a0Siege of Sarajevo\u00a0had already begun in April after Bosnia and Herzegovina had declared independence. The conflict, typified by the years-long Sarajevo siege and the\u00a0Srebrenica massacre, was by far the bloodiest and most widely covered of the Yugoslav wars. The Bosnian Serb faction led by ultra-nationalist\u00a0Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107\u00a0promised independence for all Serb areas of Bosnia from the majority-Bosniak government of Bosnia. To link the disjointed parts of territories populated by Serbs and areas claimed by Serbs, Karad\u017ei\u0107 pursued an agenda of systematic ethnic cleansing primarily against Bosnians through massacre and forced removal of Bosniak populations.\u00a0Prijedor ethnic cleansing,\u00a0Vi\u0161egrad massacres,\u00a0Fo\u010da ethnic cleansing,\u00a0Doboj massacre,\u00a0Zvornik massacre,\u00a0siege of Gora\u017ede\u00a0and others were reported.<br \/>\nAt the end of 1992, tensions between\u00a0Bosnian Croats\u00a0and Bosniaks rose and their collaboration fell apart. In January 1993, the two former allies engaged in open conflict, resulting in the\u00a0Croat\u2013Bosniak War.\u00a0In 1994 the US brokered peace between Croatian forces and the Bosnian\u00a0Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina\u00a0with the\u00a0Washington Agreement. After the successful Flash and Storm operations, the Croatian Army and the combined Bosnian and Croat forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, conducted an operation codenamed\u00a0Operation Mistral\u00a0in September 1995 to push back Bosnian Serb military gains.<br \/>\nThe advances on the ground along with\u00a0NATO air strikes\u00a0put pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to come to the negotiating table. Pressure was put on all sides to stick to the cease-fire and\u00a0negotiate an end\u00a0to the war in Bosnia. The war ended with the signing of the\u00a0Dayton Agreement\u00a0on 14 December 1995, with the formation of\u00a0Republika Srpska\u00a0as an entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Central Intelligence Agency\u00a0(CIA) in the United States reported in April 1995 that 90 percent of all the atrocities in the Yugoslav wars up to that point had been committed by Serb militants.\u00a0Most of these atrocities occurred in Bosnia.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Kosovo War<\/strong> (1998\u20131999)<br \/>\nAfter September 1990 when the\u00a01974 Yugoslav Constitution\u00a0had been unilaterally repealed by the\u00a0Socialist Republic of Serbia, Kosovo&#8217;s autonomy suffered and so the region was faced with state organized oppression: from the early 1990s, Albanian language radio and television were restricted and newspapers shut down. Kosovar Albanians were fired in large numbers from public enterprises and institutions, including banks, hospitals, the post office and schools.\u00a0In June 1991 the\u00a0University of Pri\u0161tina\u00a0assembly and several faculty councils were dissolved and replaced by Serbs. Kosovar Albanian teachers were prevented from entering school premises for the new school year beginning in September 1991, forcing students to study at home.<br \/>\nLater, Kosovar Albanians started an insurgency against Belgrade when the\u00a0Kosovo Liberation Army\u00a0was founded in 1996. Armed clashes between the two sides broke out in early 1998. A\u00a0NATO-facilitated ceasefire was signed on 15 October, but both sides broke it two months later and fighting resumed. When the killing of 45 Kosovar Albanians in the\u00a0Ra\u010dak massacre\u00a0was reported in January 1999, NATO decided that the conflict could only be settled by introducing a military peacekeeping force to forcibly restrain the two sides. After the Rambouillet Accords broke down on 23 March with Yugoslav rejection of an external peacekeeping force, NATO prepared to install the peacekeepers by force. The\u00a0NATO bombing of Yugoslavia\u00a0followed, an intervention against Serbian forces with a mainly bombing campaign, under the command of\u00a0General Wesley Clark. Hostilities ended 2\u00bd months later with the\u00a0Kumanovo Agreement. Kosovo was placed under the governmental control of the\u00a0United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo\u00a0and the military protection of\u00a0Kosovo Force\u00a0(KFOR). The 15-month war had left thousands of civilians killed on both sides and over a million displaced.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Insurgency in the Pre\u0161evo Valley<\/strong> (1999\u20132001)<br \/>\nThe Insurgency in the Pre\u0161evo Valley was an armed conflict between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and ethnic-Albanian insurgents\u00a0of the\u00a0Liberation Army of Pre\u0161evo, Medve\u0111a and Bujanovac\u00a0(U\u00c7PMB), beginning in June 1999.\u00a0There were instances during the conflict in which the Yugoslav government requested KFOR support in suppressing U\u00c7PMB attacks, since the government could only use lightly armed military forces as part of the Kumanovo Treaty, which created a buffer zone so the bulk of the Yugoslav armed forces could not enter.\u00a0Yugoslav president\u00a0Vojislav Ko\u0161tunica\u00a0warned that fresh fighting would erupt if KFOR units did not act to prevent the attacks that were coming from the U\u00c7PMB.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia<\/strong> (2001)<br \/>\nThe insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia was an armed conflict in\u00a0Tetovo\u00a0which began when the ethnic\u00a0Albanian\u00a0National Liberation Army\u00a0(NLA) militant group began attacking the\u00a0security forces\u00a0of the\u00a0Republic of Macedonia\u00a0at the beginning of February 2001, and ended with the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ohrid_Agreement\">Ohrid <\/a>Agreement. The goal of the NLA was to give greater rights and autonomy to the country&#8217;s Albanian minority, who make up 25.2% (54.7% of the population in Tetovo) of the population of Macedonia.\u00a0There were also claims that the group ultimately wished to see Albanian-majority areas secede from the country,\u00a0although high-ranking NLA members have denied this.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ARMS EMBARGO<br \/>\n<\/strong>The\u00a0United Nations Security Council\u00a0had imposed an arms embargo in September 1991.\u00a0Nevertheless, various states had been engaged in, or facilitated, arms sales to the warring factions. In 2012, Chile convicted nine people, including two retired generals, for their part in arms sales.<\/p>\n<p><strong>WAR CRIMES<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Genocide.\u00a0<\/strong>It is widely believed that\u00a0mass murders\u00a0against Bosniaks in Bosnia and Herzegovina escalated into genocide. On 18 December 1992, the\u00a0United Nations General Assembly\u00a0issued resolution 47\/121 condemning &#8220;aggressive acts by the Serbian and Montenegrin forces to acquire more territories by force&#8221; and called such ethnic cleansing &#8220;a form of\u00a0genocide&#8221;.\u00a0In its report published on 1 January 1993,\u00a0Helsinki Watch\u00a0was one of the first\u00a0civil rights organisations\u00a0that warned that &#8220;the extent of the violence and its selective nature along ethnic and religious lines suggest crimes of genocidal character against Muslim and, to a lesser extent, Croatian populations in Bosnia-Hercegovina&#8221;.\u00a0A telegram sent to the White House on 8 February 1994 and penned by U.S. Ambassador to Croatia,\u00a0Peter W. Galbraith, stated that genocide was occurring. The telegram cited &#8220;constant and indiscriminate shelling and gunfire&#8221; of Sarajevo by Karadzic&#8217;s Yugoslav People Army; the harassment of minority groups in Northern Bosnia &#8220;in an attempt to force them to leave&#8221;; and the use of detainees &#8220;to do dangerous work on the front lines&#8221; as evidence that genocide was being committed. In 2005, the\u00a0United States Congress\u00a0passed a resolution declaring that &#8220;the Serbian policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing meet the terms defining genocide&#8221;.<br \/>\nA trial took place before the\u00a0International Court of Justice, following a\u00a01993 suit\u00a0by Bosnia and Herzegovina against Serbia and Montenegro alleging\u00a0genocide. The ICJ ruling of 26 February 2007 indirectly determined the war&#8217;s nature to be international, though clearing Serbia of direct responsibility for the genocide committed by the forces of\u00a0Republika Srpska. The ICJ concluded, however, that Serbia failed to prevent genocide committed by Serb forces and failed to punish those responsible, and bring them to justice.<br \/>\nDespite the evidence of many kinds of war crimes conducted simultaneously by different Serb forces in different parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, especially in\u00a0Bijeljina,\u00a0Sarajevo,\u00a0Prijedor,\u00a0Zvornik,\u00a0Banja Luka,\u00a0Vi\u0161egrad\u00a0and\u00a0Fo\u010da, the judges ruled that the criteria for genocide with the specific intent (dolus specialis) to destroy Bosnian Muslims were met\u00a0only in Srebrenica\u00a0or Eastern Bosnia in 1995. The court concluded that other crimes, outside Srebrenica, committed during the 1992\u20131995 war, may amount to\u00a0crimes against humanity\u00a0according to the international law, but that these acts did not, in themselves, constitute genocide per se.<br \/>\nThe crime of genocide in the Srebrenica enclave was confirmed in several guilty verdicts handed down by the ICTY, most notably in the conviction of the Bosnian Serb leader\u00a0Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ethnic cleansing.\u00a0<\/strong>Ethnic cleansing\u00a0was a common phenomenon in the wars in Croatia, Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina. This entailed intimidation,\u00a0forced expulsion, or\u00a0killing\u00a0of the unwanted ethnic group as well as the destruction of the places of worship, cemeteries and cultural and historical buildings of that ethnic group in order to alter the population composition of an area in the favour of another ethnic group which would become the majority. These examples of\u00a0territorial nationalism\u00a0and\u00a0territorial aspirations\u00a0are part of the goal of an\u00a0ethno-state. Detention camps such as\u00a0Omarska\u00a0and\u00a0Trnopolje\u00a0were also designated as an integral part of the overall ethnic cleansing strategy of the authorities.<br \/>\nAccording to numerous ICTY verdicts and indictments, Serb\u00a0and Croat\u00a0forces performed\u00a0ethnic cleansing\u00a0of their territories planned by their political leadership to create ethnically pure states (Republika Srpska\u00a0and\u00a0Republic of Serbian Krajina\u00a0by the Serbs; and\u00a0Herzeg-Bosnia\u00a0by the Croats).<br \/>\nAccording to the ICTY, Serb forces deported at least 80\u2013100,000 Croats in Croatia in 1991\u201392\u00a0and at least 700,000 Albanians in Kosovo in 1999.\u00a0Further hundreds of thousands of Muslims were forced out of their homes by the Serb forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\u00a0By one estimate, the Serb forces drove at least 700,000 Bosnian Muslims from the area of Bosnia under their control.<\/p>\n<p><strong>War rape.\u00a0<\/strong>War rape\u00a0occurred as a matter of official orders as part of\u00a0ethnic cleansing, to displace the targeted ethnic group.\u00a0According to the Tresnjevka Women&#8217;s Group, more than 35,000 women and children were held in such Serb-run &#8220;rape camps&#8221;.\u00a0Dragoljub Kunarac,\u00a0Radomir Kova\u010d, and\u00a0Zoran Vukovi\u0107\u00a0were convicted of\u00a0crimes against humanity\u00a0for rape, torture, and enslavement committed during the\u00a0Fo\u010da massacres.<br \/>\nThe evidence of the magnitude of rape in Bosnia and Herzegovina prompted the ICTY to deal openly with these abuses.\u00a0Reports of sexual violence during the\u00a0Bosnian War\u00a0(1992\u20131995) and Kosovo War (1998\u20131999) perpetrated by the Serbian regular and irregular forces have been described as &#8220;especially alarming&#8221;.\u00a0The NATO-led Kosovo Force documented rapes of Albanian, Roma and Serbian women by both Serbs and members of the Kosovo Liberation Army.<br \/>\nOthers have estimated that during the Bosnian War between 20,000 and 50,000 women, mainly Bosniak, were raped.\u00a0There are few reports of rape and sexual assault between members of the same ethnic group.<br \/>\nWar rape in the Yugoslav Wars has often been characterized as a\u00a0crime against humanity. Rape perpetrated by Serb forces served to destroy cultural and social ties of the victims and their communities.\u00a0Serbian policies allegedly urged soldiers to rape Bosniak women until they became pregnant as an attempt towards ethnic cleansing. Serbian soldiers hoped to force Bosniak women to carry Serbian children through repeated rape.\u00a0Often Bosniak women were held in captivity for an extended period of time and only released slightly before the birth of a child conceived of rape. The systematic rape of Bosniak women may have carried further-reaching repercussions than the initial displacement of rape victims. Stress, caused by the trauma of rape, coupled with the lack of access to reproductive health care often experienced by displaced peoples, led to serious health risks for victimized women.<br \/>\nDuring the Kosovo War thousands of Kosovo Albanian women and girls became victims of sexual violence. War rape was used as a weapon of war and an instrument of systematic\u00a0ethnic cleansing; rape was used to terrorize the civilian population, extort money from families, and force people to flee their homes. According to a report by the\u00a0Human Rights Watch\u00a0group in 2000, rape in the Kosovo War can generally be subdivided into three categories: rapes in women&#8217;s homes, rapes during flight, and rapes in detention.\u00a0The majority of the perpetrators were Serbian paramilitaries, but also included Serbian special police or Yugoslav army soldiers. Virtually all of the sexual assaults Human Rights Watch documented were gang rapes involving at least two perpetrators.\u00a0Since the end of the war, rapes of Serbian, Albanian, and Roma women by ethnic Albanians \u2014 sometimes by members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) \u2013 have been documented.\u00a0Rapes occurred frequently in the presence, and with the acquiescence, of military officers. Soldiers, police, and paramilitaries often raped their victims in the full view of numerous witnesses.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CONSEQUENCES<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Casualties.<\/strong> Some estimates put the number of killed in the Yugoslav Wars at 140,000.\u00a0The\u00a0Humanitarian Law Center\u00a0estimates that in the conflicts in former Yugoslav republics at least 130,000 people lost their lives.<br \/>\nSlovenia&#8217;s involvement in the conflicts was brief, thus avoiding higher casualties, and around 70 people were killed in its ten-day conflict.<br \/>\nThe War in Croatia left an estimated 20,000 people dead. During the War in Croatia, 43.4% of the killed on the Croatian side were civilians.<br \/>\nBosnia and Herzegovina suffered the heaviest burden of the fighting: between 97,207 and 102,622 people were killed in the war.<br \/>\nIn the Kosovo conflict, around 13,500 were killed.<br \/>\nOverall, no less than 133,000 people were killed in the post-Yugoslav conflicts in the &#8217;90s.\u00a0The highest death toll was in\u00a0Sarajevo: with around 14,000 killed during the siege,\u00a0the city lost almost as many people as the entire war in Kosovo.<br \/>\nIn relative and absolute numbers, Bosniaks suffered the heaviest losses: 64,036 of their people were killed, which represents a death toll of over 3% of their entire ethnic group.\u00a0They experienced the worst plight in the Srebrenica massacre, where the\u00a0mortality rate\u00a0of the Bosniak men (irrespective of their age or civilian status) reached 33% in July 1995.\u00a0The share of Bosniaks among all the civilian fatalities during the Bosnian War was around 83%, rising to almost 95% in Eastern Bosnia.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Internally displaced and refugees.\u00a0<\/strong>It is estimated that the wars in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo produced about 2.4 million\u00a0refugees\u00a0and an additional 2 million\u00a0internally displaced\u00a0persons.<br \/>\nThe war in Bosnia and Herzegovina caused 2.2 million refugees or displaced, of which over half were Bosniaks.\u00a0Up until 2001, there were still 650,000 displaced Bosniaks, while 200,000 left the country permanently.<br \/>\nThe Kosovo War caused 862,979 Albanian refugees who were either expelled from the Serb forces or fled from the battle front.\u00a0In addition, several hundreds of thousands were\u00a0internally displaced, which means that, according to the\u00a0OSCE, almost 90% of all Albanians were displaced from their homes in Kosovo by June 1999.\u00a0After the end of the war, Albanians returned, but over 200,000 Serbs, Romani and other non-Albanians fled Kosovo. By the end of 2000, Serbia thus became the host of 700,000 Serb refugees or internally displaced from Kosovo, Croatia and Bosnia.<br \/>\nFrom the perspective of\u00a0asylum\u00a0for internally displaced or refugees, Croatia took the brunt of the crisis. According to some sources, in 1992 Croatia was the host to almost 750,000 refugees or internally displaced, which represents a quota of almost 16% of its population of 4.7 million inhabitants: these figures included 420 to 450,000 Bosnian refugees, 35,000 refugees from Serbia (mostly from Vojvodina and Kosovo) while a further 265,000 persons from other parts of Croatia itself were internally displaced. This would be equivalent of Germany being a host to 10 million displaced people or France to 8 million people.\u00a0Official\u00a0UNHCR\u00a0data indicate that Croatia was the host to 287,000 refugees and 344,000 internally displaced in 1993. This is a ratio of 64.7 refugees per 1000 inhabitants.\u00a0In its 1992 report, UNHCR placed Croatia #7 on its list of 50 most refugee burdened countries: it registered 316 thousand refugees, which is a ratio of 15:1 relative to its total population.\u00a0Together with those internally displaced, Croatia was the host to at least 648,000 people in need of an accommodation in 1992.\u00a0In comparison,\u00a0Macedonia had 10.5 refugees per 1000 inhabitants in 1999.\u00a0Slovenia was the host to 45,000 refugees in 1993, which is 22.7 refugees per 1000 inhabitants.\u00a0Serbia and Montenegro\u00a0were the host to 479,111 refugees in 1993, which is a ratio of 45.5 refugees per 1000 inhabitants. By 1998 this grew to 502,037 refugees (or 47.7 refugees per 1000 inhabitants). By 2000 the number of refugees fell to 484,391 persons, but the number of internally displaced grew to 267,500, or a combined total of 751,891 persons who were displaced and in need of an accommodation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Material damage.\u00a0<\/strong>Material and economic damages brought by the conflicts were catastrophic. Bosnia and Herzegovina had a\u00a0GDP\u00a0of between $8\u20139 billion before the war. The government estimated the overall war damages at $50\u2013$70 billion. It also registered a GDP decline of 75% after the war.\u00a0Some 60% of the housing in the country has been either damaged or destroyed, which proved a problem when trying to bring all the refugees back home.\u00a0Bosnia also became the most\u00a0landmine\u00a0contaminated country of Europe: 1820\u00a0km2\u00a0of its territory were contaminated with these explosives, which represent 3.6% of its land surface. Between 3 and 6 million landmines were scattered throughout Bosnia. Five thousand people died from them, of which 1,520 were killed after the war.<br \/>\nIn 1999, the\u00a0Croatian Parliament\u00a0passed a bill estimating war damages of the country at $37 billion.\u00a0The government alleges that between 1991 and April 1993 an estimated total of 210,000 buildings in Croatia (including schools, hospitals and\u00a0refugee camps) were either damaged or destroyed from shelling by the\u00a0Republic of Serbian Krajina\u00a0and the JNA forces. Cities affected by the shelling were\u00a0Karlovac,\u00a0Gospi\u0107,\u00a0Ogulin,\u00a0Zadar,\u00a0Biograd\u00a0and others.\u00a0The Croatian government also acknowledged that 7,489 buildings belonging to Croatian Serbs were damaged or destroyed by explosives, arson or other deliberate means by the end of 1992. From January to March 1993 another 220 buildings were also damaged or destroyed. Criminal charges were brought against 126 Croats for such acts.<br \/>\nSanctions against FR Yugoslavia\u00a0created a\u00a0hyperinflation\u00a0of 300\u00a0million percent of the\u00a0Yugoslav dinar. By 1995, almost 1 million workers lost their jobs while the gross domestic product has fallen 55 percent since 1989.\u00a0The\u00a01999 NATO bombing of Serbia\u00a0resulted in additional damages. One of the most severe was the bombing of the\u00a0Pan\u010devo petrochemical factory, which caused the release of 80,000 tonnes of burning fuel into the environment. Approximately 31,000 rounds of\u00a0depleted Uranium\u00a0ammuniton were used during this bombing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ICTY\/MICT.<\/strong> International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia\u00a0and\u00a0Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals<br \/>\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was a body of the\u00a0U.N.\u00a0established to prosecute serious crimes committed during the Yugoslav Wars, and to try their perpetrators. The tribunal was an\u00a0ad hoc\u00a0court located in\u00a0The Hague,\u00a0Netherlands. One of the most prominent\u00a0trials involved ex-Serbian President Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, who was in 2002 indicted on 66 counts of\u00a0crimes against humanity,\u00a0war crimes\u00a0and\u00a0genocide\u00a0allegedly committed in wars in Kosovo, Bosnia and Croatia.\u00a0His trial remained incomplete since he died in 2006, before a verdict was reached. Nonetheless, ICTY&#8217;s trial &#8220;helped to delegitimize Milosevic&#8217;s leadership&#8221;, as one scholar put it.<br \/>\nSeveral convictions were handed over by the ICTY and its successor, the Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals (MICT). The first notable verdict confirming genocide in Srebrenica was the case against Serb General\u00a0Radislav Krsti\u0107: he was sentenced in 2001, while the Appeals Chamber confirmed the verdict in 2004.<br \/>\nAnother verdict was against ex-Bosnian Serb leader,\u00a0Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107, who was also convicted for genocide.\u00a0On 22 November 2017, general\u00a0Ratko Mladi\u0107\u00a0was sentenced to a\u00a0life in prison.\u00a0Other important convictions included those of ultranationalist\u00a0Vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj,\u00a0paramilitary leader\u00a0Milan Luki\u0107,\u00a0Bosnian Serb politician\u00a0Mom\u010dilo Kraji\u0161nik,\u00a0Bosnian Serb general\u00a0Stanislav Gali\u0107, who was convicted for the\u00a0siege of Sarajevo,\u00a0the former Assistant Minister of the\u00a0Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs\u00a0and Chief of its Public Security Department,\u00a0Vlastimir \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107, who was convicted for crimes in Kosovo,\u00a0ex-JNA commander\u00a0Mile Mrk\u0161i\u0107\u00a0as well as both of\u00a0Republic of Serbian Krajina\u00a0ex-Presidents\u00a0Milan Marti\u0107\u00a0and\u00a0Milan Babi\u0107.<br \/>\nSeveral Croats, Bosniaks and Albanians were convicted for crimes, as well, including ex-Herzegovina Croat leader\u00a0Jadranko Prli\u0107\u00a0and commander\u00a0Slobodan Praljak,\u00a0Bosnian Croat military commander\u00a0Mladen Naletili\u0107,\u00a0ex-Bosnian Army commander\u00a0Enver Had\u017eihasanovi\u0107\u00a0and ex-Kosovo commander\u00a0Haradin Bala.<br \/>\nIn the\u00a0Trial of Gotovina et al, Croatian Generals\u00a0Ante Gotovina\u00a0and\u00a0Mladen Marka\u010d\u00a0were ultimately acquitted on appeal in 2012.<br \/>\nBy 2019, based on its statue,\u00a0the ICTY found that the Serb officials were found guilty of\u00a0persecutions,\u00a0deportation\u00a0and\/or\u00a0forcible transfer\u00a0(crimes against humanity, Article 5) in Croatia,\u00a0Bosnia and Herzegovina,\u00a0Kosovo\u00a0and\u00a0Vojvodina. They were also found guilty of\u00a0murder\u00a0(crimes against humanity, Article 5) in Croatia,\u00a0Bosnia and Herzegovina\u00a0and Kosovo;\u00a0as well as\u00a0terror\u00a0(violations of\u00a0the laws or customs of war, Article 3)\u00a0and genocide (Article 4) in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Croat forces were not found guilty of anything in Croatia, but were found guilty of deportation, other inhumane acts (forcible transfer), murder and persecutions (crimes against humanity, Article 5) in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\u00a0The Bosniak forces were found guilty of inhuman treatment (grave breaches of the\u00a0Geneva Conventions, Article 2), murder; cruel treatment (violations of the laws or customs of war, Article 3) in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\u00a0One Albanian official was found guilty of torture, cruel treatment, murder (violations of the laws or customs of war, Article 3) in Kosovo.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ILLEGAL ARMS TRADE<br \/>\n<\/strong>After the fighting ended, millions of weapons were left with civilians who held on to them in case violence should resurface. These weapons later turned up on the arms black market of Europe.<br \/>\nIn 2018 there were no exact official figures on how many firearms are missing; in Serbia authorities have given estimates ranging from 250,000 to 900,000 of different kinds are in circulation. In Bosnia, public reports state a figure of 750,000. At the end of 2017, a man entered a bus in Banja Luka carrying two bags with 36 hand grenades, three assault rifles, seven handguns, a mine and hundreds of cartridges with Gothenburg as the destination. He was stopped in the neighbouring country of Slovenia. A 26-year-old woman was stopped at the border to Croatia with three antitank weapons and a hand grenade. Police found four machine guns, three battle rifles, three assault rifles and a large quantity of explosives at the home of a 79-year-old man. According to a UNDP official, getting civilians to give up their arms to state authorities is complicated due to people are then forced to trust that authorities will protect them. Instead, criminals collect the weapons. Some of the missing weapons were used in the\u00a0November 2015 Paris attacks\u00a0during which 137 people were killed by jihadists. Other arms were assault rifles used in the\u00a02015 Gothenburg pub shooting.<br \/>\nSuccessor-state government efforts to reduce the prevalence of illegally held arms are co-ordinated through a Regional Approach to Stockpile Reduction (RASR) focused on reducing stockpiles, arms diversion and unexplained explosions in South-east Europe. Partners include the European Union, the US Office of Weapons Removal and Abatement, the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and NATO&#8217;s Support and Procurement Agency.\u00a0Funded by the US Government, activities include annual workshops attended by US government officials from the Departments of State and Defense and defense ministry representatives from the Yugoslav successor states .<\/p>\n<p><strong>TIMELINE of the YUGOSLAV WARS<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>1990<br \/>\n<\/strong>Log Revolution.\u00a0SAO Krajina\u00a0is proclaimed over an indefinite area of Croatia.<br \/>\n<strong>1991<\/strong><br \/>\nSlovenia and Croatia declare independence in June, Macedonia in September.\u00a0War in Slovenia\u00a0lasts ten days, and results in dozens of fatalities.
