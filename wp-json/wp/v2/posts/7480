On a Saturday in late September, Doug Brown and I climbed the highest point on the ridge, an unnamed 2602 m. spire. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Starting at 8:50 from the end of the Ben Hur road at 5100\u2019(about 957-261), we embarked on the flagged trail and reached the 6250\u2019 lower lake at 963-245 and northwest of Mt. Chipman in 1 hr. 10 min. Here the trail ends. We continued along the lake\u2019s west bank almost to the south end before ascending southwest along a watercourse and up a rocky gully to reach a vertical wall. At this point, we traversed right 50 m. to gain easy, mossy ramps leading to the alpine at about 960-240. This is by far the easiest approach to the Caribou basin; other routes from the lower lake have led to cliff bands or fields of house-sized boulders. We continued to the lake at 957-234, skirted its north side, and ascended beside the inlet stream, making for the middle of three summits located to the southwest. Although this one looked the lowest, our trim map told us otherwise. It was correct. In good time we reached the 2540 m. col (951-231; two large cairns) northwest of our goal. A sharp granite spire just to the northwest looked inviting, but we decided that was the right hand of the three and lower. Heading southeast via easy scrambling, we gained the south ridge of our objective, negotiated a short bit of fourth-class ramp\/slab, and summited at 1:20 pm (4 hrs. 20 min. up, 952-230, 82F\/14 does not clearly show this point). <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">After inspecting the small cairn (no record), we gazed northwest to the spire we had contemplated and agreed it was considerably lower (2580 m. contour on the trim map). Beyond it lay Satisfaction Pk., at 2598 m. just a shade lower than our point. Of the moderately interesting bumps to the southeast along the ridge, all were clearly lower. Satisfied that we had scaled the highest point, we departed at 2:05, carefully down-climbing our ascent route. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Once back to the col, we re-traced our steps to the truck by 5:20 (3 hr. 15 min. descent, 8 hr. 40 min. day). No rope was used, or taken. This area makes for excellent autumn outings on generally solid rock. The rough, but flagged and cairned, Ben Hur trail allows access to the alpine in about two hours. Note that the alpine terrain \u2014drained by Ben Hur and Deer Creeks on the north and Bjerkness Creek on the east\u2014is quite broken up. It\u2019s not like walking on a golf course. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Kim Kratky<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>CARIBOU RIDGE SPIRE\u00a0 \u00a0 2600m\u00a0 \u00a08530&#8242; On Caribou Ridge (more rugged than the map indicates) at 952-230, 0.7 km southeast of Satisfaction Peak, this small spire does not appear on the map contours.
