Its total height is 165 m (541\u00a0feet), making it the tallest man-made waterfall in the world. Of its 3 sections, the top one is the tallest, at 83 m (272\u00a0feet). It is located 7.7\u00a0km from\u00a0Terni.<br \/>\nIts source is a portion of the waters of the river\u00a0Velino\u00a0(the rest of the river flows into a hydroelectric power plant), after flowing through\u00a0Piediluco\u00a0lake near the community of\u00a0Marmore. It pours into the valley below formed by the river\u00a0Nera. Its flow is turned on and off according to a published schedule, to satisfy the needs of tourists and the power company alike. Tourists try to be there the moment the gates are opened to see the powerful rush of water.<br \/>\nHistory. The Velino river flows through the highlands that surround the city of Rieti. In ancient times, it fed a wetland in the\u00a0Rieti Valley\u00a0that was thought to bring illness (probably\u00a0malaria). To remove that threat to the city of Rieti, in 271 BC, the\u00a0Roman consul\u00a0Manius Curius Dentatus\u00a0ordered the construction of a canal (the\u00a0<i>Curiano Trench<\/i>) to divert the stagnant waters into the natural cliff at Marmore. From there, the water fell into the Nera river below. However, that solution created a different problem: when the Velino river was in flood stage, its water flowed through the Nera toward the city of Terni, threatening its population. The issue was so contentious between the two cities that the Roman Senate was forced to address it in 54 BC.\u00a0Aulus Pompeius\u00a0represented Terni, and\u00a0Cicero represented Rieti. The Senate did nothing about the problem, and the problem remained the same for centuries.<br \/>\nLack of maintenance in the canal resulted in a decrease in the flow until eventually, the wetland began to reappear. In 1422,\u00a0Pope Gregory XII\u00a0ordered the construction of a new canal to restore the original flow (the\u00a0<i>Gregorian Trench<\/i>\u00a0or\u00a0<i>Rieti Trench<\/i>).<br \/>\nIn 1545,\u00a0Pope Paul III\u00a0ordered that a new canal be built (the\u00a0<i>Pauline Trench<\/i>). The plan was to expand the Curian Trench and to build a regulating valve to control the flow. Upon its completion some 50 years later (in 1598),\u00a0Pope Clement VIII\u00a0inaugurated the new work, and named it after himself: the\u00a0<i>Clementine Trench<\/i>.<br \/>\nIn the following two centuries, the presence of the canal was problematic for the countryside in the valley below, as the Nera often flooded it. In 1787,\u00a0Pope Pius VI\u00a0ordered architect\u00a0Andrea Vici\u00a0to modify the leaps below the falls, giving the falls its present look and finally resolving the majority of the problems.<br \/>\nIn 1896, the newly formed steel mills in Terni began using the water flow in the Curiano Trench to power their operation. In the following years, engineers began using the water flow to generate electricity.<br \/>\nMost of the time, the water in the canals above the falls is diverted to a hydroelectric power plant, so the flow in the falls themselves is heavily reduced. Piediluco Lake, above the falls, is used as a reservoir for the power plant. The Galleto power plant, built in 1929, is architecturally interesting. Its capacity is about 530 MW. To control the operation of the power plant, and to satisfy tourists, the falls are turned on according to a set schedule, achieving a spectacular effect at full flow. An alarm is sounded first, then the gates are opened, and in a few minutes, the small stream is transformed into a full-sized river rushing into the void below. Normally, the falls are turned on between 12:00 and 13:00 and again between 16:00 and 17:00 every day, with additional times on holidays. An entrance fee is charged to visit the falls and the surrounding area.<br \/>\nA path along the falls allows the visitor to hike up to the top of the falls. Along the way, a tunnel leads to an observatory just next to the falls, where a visitor is guaranteed to get soaked. A safer observatory near the top affords a grandiose view of the falls and of the Nera valley below.<br \/>\nIt is a walk down from the ticket office (closed at this time of year), cross a bridge over the canal, and pass several tunnel openings and small canals. Descend to the upper viewpoint for great views of the falls. There are three lower viewpoints reached on stairs.

The Civita (or City) was the birthplace of\u00a0Saint Bonaventure, who died in 1274. The location of his boyhood house has long since fallen off the edge of the cliff. By the 16th century, Civita di Bagnoregio was beginning to decline, becoming eclipsed by its former suburb Bagnoregio.<br \/>\nAt the end of the 17th century, the bishop and the municipal government were forced to move to\u00a0Bagnoregio\u00a0because of a major earthquake that accelerated the old town&#8217;s decline. At that time, the area was part of the\u00a0Papal States. In the 19th century, Civita di Bagnoregio&#8217;s location was turning into an island and the pace of the erosion quickened as the layer of clay below the stone was reached in the area where today&#8217;s bridge is situated. Bagnoregio continues as a small but prosperous town, while the older site became known in Italian as\u00a0<i>La citt\u00e0 che muore<\/i>\u00a0(&#8220;The Dying Town&#8221;). Civita di Bagnoregio has only recently been experiencing a tourist revival.<br \/>\nThe town is noted for its striking position on top of a plateau of friable volcanic tuff overlooking the\u00a0Tiber\u00a0river valley. It is in constant danger of destruction as the edges of the plateau collapse due to\u00a0erosion, leaving the buildings to crumble as their underlying support falls away. As of 2004, there were plans to reinforce the plateau with\u00a0steel\u00a0rods to prevent further geological damage.<br \/>\nThe city is also much admired for its\u00a0architecture\u00a0spanning several hundred years. Civita di Bagnoregio owes much of its unaltered condition to its relative isolation; the town was able to withstand most intrusions of modernity as well as the destruction brought by two\u00a0world wars. The population today varies from about 7 people in winter to more than 100 in summer.<br \/>\nGoogle Maps took me to a rural valley far below this medieval village sitting atop a volcanic plug &#8211; fortunate as this is the best place to appreciate the spectacular setting. Drive through the town of Bagnoregio to the parking areas at the east end of the town. Stairs lead down from the viewpoint to a road, the ticket booth and the bridge that descends and then ascends into the village. An arched stone bridge was built in 1923 but was destroyed by landslides and the retreating German army in 1944. The present reinforced concrete bridge was opened in 1963.<br \/>\nUnless you want to eat at the many restaurants or buy souvenirs, I would suggest not wasting \u20ac5 to enter the town. Beside old stone houses, the 1699 church has little to see (contains the silver reliquary containing the bones of St Banaventura). There are few views of the valley below. The Cultural Landscape of Civita di Bagnoregio is a Tentative WHS.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ORVIETO<\/strong> (pop 21,000)<br \/>\nOrvieto sits on top of a volcanic plug, making it an imposing sight from the valleys surrounding it.

Combining engineering and architectural d\u00e9cor, this was commissioned by Pope Clement VII in 1527 following his stay in Orvieto. Rome, sacked by the imperial army in the same year, was becoming unsafe. Orvieto was considered a place of Papal refuge making it likely to be besieged so there was a need for a reliable water supply. A well was designed to tap the springs of Mt Zeno that emerged from the foot of the cliff. The well was completed in 1537 and was given its strange name as it supposedly resembled St Patrick\u2019s Cavern in Ireland. The well is a vast cylinder 53.13m deep and 13m wide initially cut out of rock but lined with bricks lower down. Two independent spiral staircases, each with 248 steps, one for descending and one for ascending, were built large enough to accommodate the donkeys used to carry water to the surface. 70 windows cut into the wall light the stairs, but it is still gloomy and dark.

St Francis (1181-1226) was born in Assisi. The son of a wealthy cloth merchant, he was quite worldly. Initially in the army, he had a holy vision in 1205, renounced his inheritance and began a humble, \u2018primitive\u2019 life in imitation of Christ. He traveled widely around Italy and to Egypt (in 1219 he preached the Gospel in front of the Sultan), performing miracles such as curing the sick, communicating with animals and founding monasteries. He spent months praying in a cave as a hermit. Before long, his wise words and good deeds had attracted a crowd of followers. He had asked his followers to bury him in Assisi on a hill known as Colle d\u2019Inferno where people were executed at the gallows until the 13<sup>th<\/sup> century, so as to be in keeping with Jesus, who had died on the cross among criminals and outcasts.<br \/>\nHe was canonized just two years later, after which the business of \u2018selling\u2019 St Francis began in earnest, making modern Assisi an ironic comment on Francis\u2019 ascetic and spiritual values with all its tourist-derived business.<br \/>\nThe Romanesque lower church (Basilica Inferiore) was started two years after his death and has a much lower ceiling (blue with yellow stars and geometrics painted on the ribs of the vaulted ceiling). The walls are covered with several frescoes, the forerunner of Roman church painting to follow.
