Mt. Ferrie is part of the long northwest-southeast tending ridge along the north side of Summit Lake and stretches from near Box Lake to Hills. On a warm and sunny Friday, Kyle Ridge, John Eggleton and I made a day trip to this attractive spot.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">First, the road access. Drive north on Highway 6 and about 8 km. north of the Summit Lake rec site, turn right or north onto the signed Wilson Lake road and re-set your odometer. Pass through the Box Lake Lumberyard, staying on the mainline and making these turns: km. 3.5, go left (signed); km. 5.3, go right; km. 6.5, go right; km. 7.5, go left; km. 8.1, go left; km. 9.7, go left (GR 544- 641); and km. 10.9, turn right or south onto the unsigned Harlow Creek road. To this point, the surface is 2WD but rough and stoney.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Reset your odometer again. Continue and at km. 4.0, turn left and cross Harlow Creek (the right fork might go toward Summit Pk.). At km. 7.3, bend right at a switchback. Finally, reach a landing at km. 8.6 (588-598, GPSed at 6145\u2019). The Harlow road is excellent 2WD.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Now for the trip. Judging that Mt. Ferrie lay to the ESE and only 1600\u2019 above us, we headed east and up into the cut block above the truck at 10:55. Clad in shorts and t-shirts, we passed into open timber, followed a watercourse, and in one hour reached a rocky basin where we lunched at the base of Ferrie\u2019s west ridge (599-595). As we snacked, we enjoyed views of the Harlow cabin, Summit Pk, and the lengthy inviting, open ridge extending for kilometres above Highway 6. After our break, we continued up the easy rock and turf of the west ridge to gain Ferrie\u2019s summit at 12:55. After inspecting the cairn (no record), we sprawled in the sun for an hour, savouring some of the most spectacular West Kootenay views I have ever enjoyed. Most of the Goat Range lay before us, with Mt. Cooper directly to the east. On the west, from south to north, we could see the Valkyrs, Valhallas, the Pinnacles, Monashee Provincial Park, the Gold Range, Mt. Begbie, and way up the Columbias beyond Revelstoke. To the east and north, we spotted Loki, Willett, Templeman, and Moby Dick and its cohorts. Heading down at 2:00, we re-traced our steps to the truck in 1 hr. 20 min. for a 4 hr. 25 min. day. An easy round trip from Nelson, 6:30 am to 5:30 pm. A good trip for next fall would be Summit Pk, directly above Summit Lake.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Kim Kratky<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>MOUNT FERRIE\u00a0 \u00a02365 m\u00a0 \u00a07759\u2019\u00a0 This is the high point of the long ridge above Summit Lake.
