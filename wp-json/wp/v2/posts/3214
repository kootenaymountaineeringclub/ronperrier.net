August is a big month for traveling around Europe so airline tickets tend to be higher. It\u2019s always cheaper to fly during the middle of the week than on a weekend. If you fly after a major holiday, prices are also a bit cheaper. Early morning or late night flights are cheaper because fewer people want to travel then. Before you commit to your departure, make sure you check other dates and times. If you are not flexible in the dates you want to fly, you will never be able to find a cheap flight. Even the difference of a day can mean hundreds of dollars in savings.<br \/>\nItasoftware.com was a Google-owned website that was invaluable to find the cheapest flights over the nest month, but did not cover ULCC nor could you book on it. It has been replaced by google.com\/flights, easily the fastest website on the planet and it also allows booking. It is often worthwhile to go to the individual airline to book &#8211; easiest and cheapest way to cancel and you can register your air miles, but not always the cheapest. Most of the time, I use skyscanner.com as it has the widest coverage of any search engine and includes some ULCC.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Be Flexible with Your Destinations<\/strong><br \/>\nInstead of going to a place with an expensive flight, go where it is the cheapest. Kayak offers the \u201cExplore tool\u201d that allows you to put in your airport and see what routes have the cheapest fares. Google Flights also has a similar (and better) feature. If you are flexible with where you want to go (i.e. anywhere but home), this is a great way to start researching where to go. Other sites that have similar search tools: Whichbudget.com, Skyscanner.com.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Try Alternative Routes<\/strong><br \/>\nNot only does it help to be flexible with dates, but try being flexible with the route you take, too. Sometimes it\u2019s cheaper to fly to London and take a ULLC to Amsterdam rather than flying direct to Amsterdam. There are so many budget carriers around the world that taking advantage of a good deal to another city and then hopping on a budget flight to your destination is sometimes the best way to go. It often means more flying time but the savings can be worth it.<br \/>\nBy working various airlines and special offers, you can save a lot. This method is not for everyone, however. It is more work, as you have to figure out lots of different routes and check different airlines. But it will shave some money off your flight, giving you more to spend at your destination.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Take Advantage of Student Discounts<\/strong><br \/>\nIf you are a student, there are many, many discounts available to you. Check out STA Travel and their search engine. You can find flexible student tickets on their website and at agency stores. It may not be the cheapest flight, just the cheapest direct flight. There are many student codes out there, and many of the tourist agencies in backpacker areas can help find you a cheap ticket.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sign Up for a Frequent Flier Program<\/strong><br \/>\nAirline rewards programs are a great way to get free flights, free upgrades, and free companion tickets. No matter how often you fly, you should be signed up for the airline\u2019s reward program. If you live in North America, stick to US-based airlines since they are involved in all the major alliances and you can earn miles on their partner flights. For example, if you fly Singapore Airlines, you can earn United Airlines miles because they are partners. Do the same if you fly Air France and use your Delta rewards account. This way you are always earning miles when you fly. However, if you aren\u2019t from the states, simply use an airline from your home country that is involved in one of these alliances.<br \/>\nThere are a lot of other ways to earn miles if you aren\u2019t jetsetting around the world all the time:<br \/>\n1. <em>Shop at member stores<\/em> \u2013 All airlines have special offers for large consumer companies such as Amazon, Apple, Best Buy, Target. Shopping at those preferred stores will earn you 2 to 4 miles per dollar spent. Sometimes even up to 10 miles per dollar spent. If you spend 1,000 dollars a month, you can earn up to 3,000 miles just by going through their websites. The products don\u2019t cost extra and it\u2019s the same company so you only win, you don\u2019t lose. I do all my shopping through the airline partners simply for the extra miles.2.<br \/>\n2. <em>Watch for special offers<\/em> \u2013 Sign up for newsletters because they often have featured offers not found on an airline\u2019s website. This could be triple miles on a selected route or as simple as Starwood\u2019s recent promotion. These bonuses don\u2019t go into the high tens of thousands but you can get a little over a long period of time by doing virtually nothing. They add up.<br \/>\n3. <em>Be a Crazy Flyer<\/em> \u2013 On forums like Flyertalk, where people hunt out the latest chances for miles, you often find people doing mileage runs. This means that an airline will offer triple miles or double elite qualifying miles (these miles, unlike normal miles, count towards your elite flyer status and can only be earned by flying) if you fly a certain route. When airlines get into price wars or offer new routes, they often launch ridiculous double or triple mile offers. Many people then fly these routes just for the miles. They will fly from California to New York and back again if they find a dirt cheap fare in order to gain miles. Mileage runs are very common and while not free, can be a useful method to gain a lot of miles on a cheap fare.<br \/>\n4. <em>Put everything on the card<\/em> \u2013 Pay nothing in cash and put everything on your travel credit card \u2013 from Starbucks to phone bills. If your total monthly spending, including business expenses, is about $3,000 per month, that\u2019s 36,000 miles just for doing nothing special. That\u2019s a free one-way flight to Europe right there. Using the websites listed in the credit card section for finding bonus offers, you\u2019ll be able to accumulate a lot of flight miles.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Know What You Want to Pay for a Flight<\/strong><br \/>\nAirline prices always bounce up and down, yet in our quest to hold out just a little longer, we can miss the lowest price. Know what you want to pay, not what you hope to pay. Don\u2019t wait for the perfect price. But be realistic. If the lowest available price is $1,000 for a flight but the average is $1,500, don\u2019t wait for $900 as it\u2019s probably not going to get that low. You will never have buyer\u2019s remorse if you find a price point you are comfortable with. No two people on a flight pay the same price, so all you can do is hope you get the price you feel good about.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Book During the Sweet Spot<\/strong><br \/>\nWith oil prices going up, airlines are raising fees. They were raised 7 times in 2013 alone. The best booking window is 6 to 8 weeks before your flight, three months during peak season. This is the sweet spot when the airlines begin to either lower or increase fares based on demand.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Some Miscellaneous Ideas<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>1. Be Unloyal.<\/strong> Being loyal to a specific brand does not make sense when the airfare costs too much. Search for airfares from all carriers rather than sticking with a specific airline.<br \/>\n<strong>2. One Way Flights.<\/strong> Booking separate one way flights may result in lower airfares and more convenient schedules than a round trip (aka return) flight.<br \/>\n<strong>3. Alternate Airports.<\/strong> Not only do many areas have more than one airport but the best airport for a given trip might not be the obvious choice. For instance, when visiting California Disneyland, instead of LAX (Los Angeles), better airport options would be LGB (Long Beach), SNA (Santa Ana\/Orange County), and ONT (Ontario). In fact, considering the traffic between LAX and Disneyland, I would also consider SAN (San Diego).<br \/>\n<strong>4. Introductory Flights.<\/strong> When an airline enters a new market, they usually offer initial lower airfares. Current examples include WOW between USA and Europe for $99 each way and Virgin America between Washington, DC area and Dallas. Even better is that existing airlines drop their fares to match the new guy.<br \/>\n<strong>5. Break Up Groups.<\/strong> When more than one person is flying together, whether a couple or family or group, compare the prices for one person versus the whole group. When one member of the group ends up in a higher fare class, many airlines will assign that rate to every member of the group. I have found lower airfares by buying separate tickets; for instance, for my family on one itinerary and myself on another. The seats can still be reserved together.<br \/>\n<strong>6. Hidden City Flights<\/strong> have had tonnes of press and it is worth mentioning what they are, although they are not of great use to travellers. Effectively you find a flight to somewhere you don&#8217;t want to go with a stop-off somewhere you do want to go at a price cheaper than the direct flight to the place you wanted to go. Obviously this only works if you have no check-in bag and one-way. If you need to travel to a hub destination you have the best chance of finding such a deal, although searching is something of an art.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ULTRA LOW COST COST CARRIERS<\/strong> (ULCCs)<br \/>\nULLCs offer a la carte pricing &#8211; you pay a cut-rate price for a seat, but everything else has an added fee: baggage, meals, seat location, any onboard luggage weighing more than 11lb, more leg room, even printing a boarding pass. ULCCs have been very successful in Europe and the US. As flying within the European continent, especially on long flights, is much cheaper per kilometer than flying across the Atlantic, the trans-Atlantic market was ripe for the picking and this is where some of the new ULLCs entered.<br \/>\nGlobal deregulation (allows foreign airlines to land anywhere they want in the US), online ticket sales and marketing (eliminates the need for costly ground staff), consolidation among mainline carriers (fares have increased but the number of available seats hasn\u2019t), and better planes (can run longer and leaner \u2013 the Boeing Dreamliner is $15 million cheaper per year to run than comparable older jets) has allowed new entrants into the airline passenger business. Gate staff, catering and aircraft maintenance are outsourced. High utilization keeps the price down to about 6 cents a kilometer.<br \/>\nULLCs especially in Europe use the smaller cheaper airports available in major cities. This is the airport with cheaper landing fees and thus keeping costs down. Check out which airlines fly into these smaller airports. For example, you can take JetBlue to Long Beach, an airport close to Los Angeles, instead of flying into LAX and, in Europe, Ryanair will fly into Eindhoven, Netherlands instead of Amsterdam airport while Norwegian Airlines flies into the smaller and harder to get to airports in Oslo and Stockholm. It happens throughout the world so always look into where you are flying. But be sure to check out how far the airports are from the city center \u2014 sometimes transportation from the airport to the city can actually make a budget airline more expensive. However, in general, these low-cost budget airlines are a good deal.<br \/>\nThey are best for simple round-trip or one-way flights that require no connections. Connecting to different airports can be an issue. The airports can be in the middle of nowhere so taxi fares can wipe out any savings. Parking may be much cheaper at these secondary airports which may be a significant cost saving if you are driving your own car. Before buying a ticket, figure out which airports are used, how far they are from town, and how you&#8217;ll get to and from them.<br \/>\nThey generally work best when you have time to spare. Factor in travel time to and from the airport, possible long check-in queues and strict check-in deadlines. There may be a required time between connecting flights.<br \/>\nCheck luggage limits as they can be as low as 33 pounds. Can you tolerate no-frills service, small seats and steep prices for a limited selection of drinks and food. As you approach your travel dates, the more likely you are to find the best deal on one of the big national airlines which drop their fares to compete at the last moment. So always do some shopping then.<br \/>\nMost are not listed on traditional searches &#8211; use lowcostairlines.com, skyeurope.com and whichbudget.com to find ULCC.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Europe<\/strong>.

Not all search engines are equal.<br \/>\nThe traditional big sites either work with or are owned by the airline companies and don\u2019t offer unbiased fares. You need to search as many flight search websites as you can in order to ensure you are leaving no stone unturned. Moreover, many sites don\u2019t list budget carriers because those airlines don\u2019t want to pay a booking commission. The best search engines are the ones that have no affiliation with any airline and make their money via advertising, not bookings.<br \/>\nAll of these websites have their weaknesses and do not include every airline. You aren\u2019t going to find Air Asia, Ryan Air, or most other ULLCs on large sites like Kayak, Expedia, or Orbitz. U.S. booking sites tend to not have the obscure foreign airlines that you see on international sites like Skyscanner or Momondo. Booking sites have blind spots since they don\u2019t cover every region of the world and every airline equally. There is no perfect airline search engine. Even the best have their faults.<br \/>\nThe real solution is finding the sites that best fit your specific travel needs \u2014 cost, layover times, ease of use and some specific functions not offered by all sites. Each has strengths using different interfaces and algorithms that produce different results.<br \/>\nThe best technique is to check one of the traditional sites, and then play around with the new guys and see if they can pull an upset. Then, before you book, check the airline\u2019s own website to make sure it\u2019s not even cheaper there. And as long as you\u2019ve popped over, it\u2019s almost always a good idea to do the actual booking from the airline\u2019s site: It\u2019s often easier to take care of the minutiae &#8211; entering your awards number, choosing seats and paying for extra luggage, as well as changing your reservation later if necessary (to make a change in the traditional site requires making the change with them, not the actual airline).<br \/>\nMany sites waive the booking fees if the booking is done between 2 and 5 AM (plus internet speeds usually much faster). Also erase your IP address after each search. As the sites see you returning and thus more likely to make a booking, the prices may mysteriously increase.<br \/>\n<em>Considerations<\/em> \u2013 Some peculiarities of the individual sites<br \/>\na. The online experience. Some sites are particularly pleasant to use, in both superficial and substantive ways, others a pain. Most straightforward is the amount of time it takes each site to process your searches, especially when you\u2019re pressed for time, and then to process the personal information and payment. If you\u2019re focused just on flights there is google.com\/flights, with shockingly instantaneous results.<br \/>\nb. When your dates or destination are flexible, most of the bigger sites offer to find you cheaper flights if you\u2019re willing to fly one to three days earlier or later, but their systems seem inflexible, and the resulting grids dizzying. Skyscanner is particularly good with price alerts.<br \/>\nc. Some will hold your reservation for between a day and a few weeks. That\u2019s great, for example, if you need to coordinate plans with others.<br \/>\nd. When you need a complex, multi-leg route, not every site allows multi-leg itineraries.<br \/>\ne. Look at layover times as some flights that are minimally cheaper have huge layovers. Some filters allow you to choose to sort by trip length, then that $401 flight might disappear under an avalanche of $9,999 flights with 89-minute layovers. That\u2019s an exaggeration but worth it? That\u2019s up to you.<br \/>\nf. Many do not include local airlines (for example Southwest in the USA and Air Asia in SE Asia). If your trip starts and ends outside North America or Europe, American and European sites often can\u2019t find cheap fares on regional carriers elsewhere in the world. Googling or asking foreign friends is a good start.<\/p>\n<p><strong>THE BEST OF THEM ALL:<\/strong><br \/>\n1. <strong>google.com\/flights<\/strong> &#8211; Shows flights for the next month or longer with prices which fluctuate by day, weekend and holiday wildly. If your travel dates are not fixed, this allows huge savings. Lightning fast. Another plus is that it warns you about drawbacks &#8211; long layovers, if flying in a prop plane. It is most helpful with complicated international trips. Excludes most foreign low-cost carriers from its searches. I go here first and get the lowest fares over a month. Then select your cheapest date. It is not biased toward certain airlines and provides the most complete list of flight options for a given itinerary.<br \/>\n2. <strong>skyscanner.com<\/strong> &#8211; Possibly the cheapest flights and often has local airlines not on other sites. Allows you to ask for the cheapest flights anywhere from any city and lists them in order of cost. Or you can get all the flights from one city to a destination and it will show a graphic trend over the course of a month allowing you to pick the cheapest time to fly if the date is not critical. Has good price alerts. Covers more of the world than any other site with more regional airlines. For example only site that covers flying around South Pacific.<br \/>\n3. Then try the individual airline &#8211; it may be best to book here as cancellations, registering miles and most things are easier. Sometimes cheaper but sometimes more expensive. <strong>onetravel.com<\/strong> &#8211; Often the cheapest flights and I used to use it regularly as it is easy to navigate and pay. But refunds cost $150 so I use much less often.<br \/>\n<strong>ONLINE TRAVEL AGENTS &#8211; THE TRADITIONAL SITES<\/strong><br \/>\nFor those who want to book an entire trip \u2014 flight, hotel, car rental, activities, tours, cruises, deals \u2014 in one place, the traditional sites will definitely save you time. Most of the traditional sites are all dependably similar, their lowest offerings rarely differing more than a few dollars.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Big Ones.<\/strong><br \/>\n1. expedia.com \u2013 Does not offer to find you cheaper flights if you\u2019re willing to fly one to three days earlier or later.

Has an opaque bidding system that works well with hotels when you do not require a specific hotel \u2014 can often save 30 to 50 percent on hotels by placing an absurdly low bid and allowing the site to charge your card before stating exactly which hotel you are paying for. You name the part of town you need, the hotel category, and the rate you&#8217;re willing to pay, and Priceline either accepts or rejects your bid. To find out the lowest bid it will accept, go to biddingfortravel.com to find out what bids Priceline accepted and rejected for specific hotels on specific dates.<br \/>\nSavings are less and more rare on flights, but do exist, particularly on domestic flights booked just a few days in advance. Savings top out at about 40 percent, so try bidding 10 or 20 percent below the cheapest standard fare. If your bid fails, no problem: Book through Priceline\u2019s regular service, which fares as well as other big-name sites. Two caveats: You can choose the date but not the departure time of your flight (or the airline), and you might be stuck with an annoying layover. But other than advance planning, there is no better way to shave dollars off a standard domestic ticket.<br \/>\n<strong>Non Traditional Sites<\/strong>.

Often the stopover has a fee (usually less than $100 plus taxes) but for that price, you get to see another country or city.<\/p>\n<p><strong>WEBSITES THAT CATER TO STUDENTS<\/strong> and Sometimes Teachers. Both require proof of attendance.<br \/>\nIf you are a full-time student, teacher or under 26 (in some cases 30), you may not realize it but you are already getting a great deal as these tickets are heavily discounted. Not only is the price reduced, but so are restrictions on tickets. At age 25 and 11 months you could fly London &#8211; Mexico City &#8211; OVERLAND &#8211; Panama &#8211; London with American Airlines off-season for \u00a3425 with a $25 date change charge.<br \/>\nAt age 26 the same ticket would cost \u00a3550 with a date change four times inflated. STA and other agencies specialize in these discounted fares. Under 26 is also the magic age for many discounted rail (particularly European) and flight passes. For those lucky enough to be under 26 what better reason is there to travel before you are no longer!<br \/>\n1. studentuniverse.com<br \/>\n2. STAtravel.co.uk<\/p>\n<p><strong>SOME LOCAL SITES USEFUL IF IN THE COUNTRY<\/strong><br \/>\n1. submarinoviagens.com \u2013 For Brazil. In Brazilian and not in English.<br \/>\n2. travelchinaguide.com &#8211; The most reliable booking for trains, flights and hotels in China. For trains, it gives how many seats are left which is very useful. With so many people and different holidays, it is often necessary to book weeks ahead at certain times of the year.<br \/>\nctrip.com &#8211; I used this on my first travels to China in 2014 but when back in 2015, it was highly dysfunctional.<br \/>\n3. bingtravel.com &#8211; Only works from the US.<br \/>\n4. nusatrip.com &#8211; Covers Indonesia and is a great website that lists all airlines, is fast and convenient to use.<br \/>\nFor Indonesia in general, the domestic flight network is growing and in a constant state of flux. There are also local carriers that service small routes, are cramped and may have dated aircraft. Website information for small airlines is often nonexistent. The best option for them is to check with local airline offices and travel agents. Refer to local chapter information in Lonely Planet for the names of the airlines. Use travel agents or simply go to the airport and compare prices for the various airline offices. Many are strictly cash based and offer last-minute deals if there are empty seats. It is essential to confirm and reconfirm or you may well be bumped.<br \/>\nIt is easy to book online with Nusatrip. In my 8 weeks in Indonesia in 2015 (did not go to Sumatra or Kalimantin), I had 8 flights and used only Garuda and Sriwijayaair, both reliable airlines.<br \/>\na. garuda-indonesia.com \u2013 Indonesian national airline that serves Bali and Jakarta from Australia and points across Asia.<br \/>\nb. sriwijayaair.com \u2013 serves Dili in East Timor from Bali + many other flights<br \/>\nNB Avoid Lion\/Wings. Could never book flights online, only at airport. Often cancels flights.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CHARTER FLIGHTS<\/strong><br \/>\nCharter flights are almost always return, returning normally 7 or 14 days after arrival and always from the same place. Charter flights generally fly from destinations in Europe to other European destinations. Long haul charter destinations are: Kenya, Canc\u00fan, The Gambia (good value and unusually on offer one-way), Israel, Turkey, Egypt, Greece, Thailand (Islands), Sri Lanka, Goa, the Caribbean (sometimes Cuba) and sometimes Brazil, UAE and Canada.<br \/>\nThese are useful to look into especially if you want a cheap short independent break, although prices are never that wonderful unless you are leaving at very short notice (cheap last minute fights to Goa or Cancun are particularly famous) and in low season. If travelling from the UK, take a look at www.charterflights.co.uk for some ideas about prices and destinations. If you are looking to head to West Africa, charter flights will probably be one of your cheapest options. See the excellent www.point-afrique.com for schedules (all flights fly in and out of Paris to Francophone West African nations; site en Fran\u00e7ais).<\/p>\n<p><strong>ROURND THE WORLD TRIPS<\/strong><br \/>\nWhether these are great or not remains the mother of all questions for RTW travellers, and the subject of much vitriol on many of the travel forums. People seem vehemently for or against a round-the-world ticket, with little room in between. I\u2019m a big proponent of not buying a round-the-world ticket, mostly because some of the places I loved the most \u2013 and spent the most time in \u2013 weren\u2019t even on my initial itinerary. A person you meet who tells you it\u2019s somewhere you cannot miss, some article that catches your eye along the way; many reasons why you want the freedom and flexibility to do as you please, as you go. It could be more important to have the flexibility and freedom of being able to change your plans on a whim, than it was to calculate the aggregate savings of a RTW ticket. A RTW ticket would have run me less in terms of bare costs, but think of the fun you&#8217;ve had in being wholly spontaneous was a fair opportunity cost for those savings.<br \/>\nMany travellers set off on a round the world trip (RTW) with just that ticket. What round the world really means is Australia\/Europe (depending on where you start) and back with stop-offs (in North or South America) and if you break this mould, you pay for it.<br \/>\nWorth knowing and little known is that some RTW tickets don&#8217;t require you to book all flights before departing and can offer extra flexibility to book as you go (although this can get more expensive).<br \/>\nAll of the above RTW options are valid for one year and date changes are free or with a small charge. Changing destinations en route (if possible) will incur a larger charge &#8211; if you do this with Oneworld it can actually extend your ticket from that point (but that policy seems to vary office to office). All of these tickets are excellent value for money if you utilize them properly.<br \/>\n<strong>Pros:<\/strong><br \/>\n\u2022 Date changes are normally free or pretty cheap.<br \/>\n\u2022 Many feel secure in planning a grand route and knowing a schedule in advance. This structure can help and you can make changes.<br \/>\n\u2022 They normally work out cheaper and from London are bargains especially if on a simple Oz and back route in the low season.<br \/>\n<strong>Cons:<\/strong><br \/>\n\u2022 In most cases you are limited to 12 months to complete your travels.<br \/>\n\u2022 You are going to have to plan your route and lock yourself into it before you go. Route changes on the road will cost you.<br \/>\n\u2022 Best to have Australia as a focus (or departure point) of your trip.<br \/>\n\u2022 You will need to take some one-way local flights anyway and often back track for your next leg. No round-the-world ticket will cover budget airlines like Air Asia, Ryan Air or Southwest Airlines &#8211; which will be cheaper for smaller regional jumps.<br \/>\n\u2022 Limited to major hubs, you will have to take internal flights to get to the likes of Nepal, Vietnam (without back-tracking) and notably across the Darien Gap (South to Central America).<br \/>\n<strong>Resources:<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>1.
