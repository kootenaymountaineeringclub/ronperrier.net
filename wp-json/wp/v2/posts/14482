The gardens followed a similar pattern of Persian Paradise gardens, with terraces arranged around a central water channel, lined with fountains and planted with a variety of flowers and trees that grew in abundance within the Valley.

It connected the kingdom of Kamboja; todays Afghanistan and Tajikistan, to ancient Pratishthana; Paithan on Godavari towards south, cities and cultural centers in north India up to Tamralipti or Tamluk on the eastern sea coast.<br \/>\nIn north India, the highway\u00a0<em>Uttarapatha\u00a0<\/em>in the Gangetic valley connected the great cities of ancient India: Taxila, Mathura, Ahichhatra, Sravasti, Saketa, Kausambi, Prayaga, Kasi, Kusinagara, Vaisali, Pataliputra, Rajgreha, Bodhagaya and Tamralipti etc. Chandragupta Maurya from Magadh reached the Indus River and met Seleucus the Greek envoy in 305 B.C.<br \/>\nThe distribution of Painted Grey Ware (PGW) settlements from the end of first millennium B.C. onwards suggests a broadly common zone cutting across various sub-cultures of the northern section of the Indian sub continent. Deluxe ceramics called the North Black Polished Ware (NBPW). Lapis lazuli coming from central Asia and Afghanistan is found at several sites like. The Asokan inscription (3<sup>rd\u00a0<\/sup>C.BC.) found in northern India (specially\u00a0<em>Uttarapatha<\/em>) defines the trade route in Indo-Gangetic divide.<br \/>\n<em>Dakshinapatha <\/em>is\u00a0a trade route to the south from Pataliputra and Kausambi to Pratishthana on the Godavari. The presence of PGW and other ceramic assemblage at a number of sites in the Morena, Ujjain, Malwa Plateau is indicative of cultural elements travelling from Northern India to this region.<br \/>\nSilk Road was for silk and gold, ivory, spices, exotic animals and plants. No single route was taken, crossing Central Asia, but several different branches developed passing through different settlements on the northern and southern routes of India.<br \/>\nInitially the route started from Changan, headed up the Gansu corridor and reached Dunhuang on the edge of Taklamakan. The northern route then passed through Yamen Guan, Kumul, Turfan, Kuka and finally arriving Kashgar at the foot of the Pamir. The southern route branched off at Dunhuang passing through Miran, Charkhlik, Cherchen, Niya, Khotan, Karghalik, Yarkand finally turning north again to meet the other route at Kashgar. Another route was branched from Yarkand and it runs through Sheghana, Balkh and onwards. Balkh was also well connected with the Samarkand by a trade route.<br \/>\nIndia was well connected with the Silk Road by three probable routes. First route was via Srinagar, Gilgit and Karakoram Range, another was via Purushapur and the last was via Hadda, Kapisa, Bamiyan which finally joins the Silk Road near Balkh. <em>Uttrapatha<\/em>\u00a0via Yunnan and Burma was used for trade with south-western China.<br \/>\nAlexander the Great colonized the area in about 330 B.C. and the effect of the Greek invasion considerable. This &#8216;crossroads&#8217; region, covering the area to the south of the Hindukush and Karakorum ranges, now Pakistan and Afghanistan, was overrun by a number of different peoples.<br \/>\nThe Kushan people in the first century A.D. moved into this crossroads area, bringing their adopted Buddhist religion with them.\u00a0Romans first encountered silk from a mysterious tribe referred to as the silk people, &#8216;Seres&#8217;. The Kushans issued gold coins on the Roman standards.<br \/>\nThe most significant commodity carried along this route was not silk, but religion. Buddhism came to China and central Asian countries from India this way, along the northern branch of the route. The first was over the Karakorum and the Buddhism in China is derived from the Gandhara culture on the Indus River, rather than directly from India. Buddhism reached Tibet later in the seventh century.<br \/>\nBuddhism penetrated China from the 1st century BC. From the 4th century, Chinese pilgrims also started to travel to India. It reached Korea in the 4th century and Japan in the 6th century. The Buddhist faith gave birth to a number of different sects in Asia which are still flourishing in Japan.<br \/>\n<strong>Ancient monastery and stupa together with adjacent land (Harwan)<\/strong>, Decorated patterns of terracotta tile-pavements in the apsidal stupa became a symbol of the art of Kashmir. Situated 12 miles north &#8211; east of Srinagar. It was a thriving and a prosperous Buddhist settlement in the early centuries of Christian era. The complex of Harwan consists of a monastery for the monks, prayer hall or Chaitya, and a Stupa dated to fourth or fifth century A.D. The most important feature of the site of archaeological value is the terracotta or baked clay titles, on the floor of the Chaitya. It is an apsidal Chaitya or horseshoe arched temple in diaper pebble style with a tiled courtyard as circumambulatory passage. These Harwan terracotta floor covering have unique place in the plastic art of India represented beautifully in the Kashmir valley for the first time. The tiles in backed clay are 18&#8217;x12&#8221; long and moulded with floral, geometrical, human and animal designs. They reflect a colourful and pulsating life style of the contemporary society. Some tiles have dancing girls, and musician beating the drums lovers chatting on the balconies a favourite theme depicted on them. There are rams and cocks fighting, geese running, ducks and pheasants within a floral pattern. The geometric design consists of wary lines, frets and fish bone patterns lotus and aquatic plants and various types of flowers adequately represented.<\/p>\n<p><strong>THE NEOLITHIC SETTLEMENT of BURZAHOM.<\/strong>\u00a0Tentative WHS (15\/04\/2014).

In the Himalayas, it stretches from Ladakh in the north to Kinnaur (in the state of Himachal Pradesh, or H.P.) in the south. Administratively, the Leh and Kargil districts of Ladakh division in J&amp;K, Spiti region of the Lahaul and Spiti district in H.P. and a part of Kinnaur District in the state of H.P.<br \/>\nThe region constitutes a Cold Desert biome with harsh climatic conditions, which can be attributed to two factors. One is its location on the leeward side of the Himalayas, which makes it a rain-shadow zone inaccessible to the annual south eastern monsoon winds that sweep the rest of the country, thus creating desert conditions with low levels of precipitation. Second is its very high elevation (ranging from 3000 \u2013 5000m ASL)\u00a0that adds to the coldness in its environment. A huge seasonal variation is seen in the climatic conditions, ranging from short and dry summers with harsh sunlight (maximum temperature to 36\u02daC during the day) to long, windy and freezing winters (minimum temperature -32\u02daC at night). Blizzards, snowstorms and avalanches are common. The soil is not very fertile and the climatic conditions allow very short growing seasons making it a bare landscape. Water resources are minimal and comprise glacier-fed streams.<br \/>\nThe many settlements provide marginally improved conditions for habitation, nestled within valleys protected from harsh winds and located near rivulets. The settlements are small, isolated, sparsely populated with Indo-Mongoloid (Tibetan) people with some parts of western Ladakh occupied by the Dards, who are intermediaries of Ladakhis and Baltis of the neighbouring Baltistan in Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK). The distinct Buddhist culture is similar to Tibet.<br \/>\nTwo distinct regions: (1) the Leh-Kargil areas of Ladakh (J&amp;K) and (2) Spiti Valley (H.P.). Although they have been closely linked throughout the ages politically and socially, the two regions have different histories attributable to their isolated geographic locations and separate access routes, from Indian as well as Tibetan sides. While Ladakh lay on the trade routes from Punjab to Kashmir, and beyond to Baltistan (Skardo), Kashgar, Yarqand, Khotan (Eastern Central Asia or Xinjiang), Gartok, Lhasa (in Tibet) with Leh acting as an important trade centre, Spiti valley was more isolated and split into eastern and western valleys, connected with Ladakh &amp; Tibet on its eastern side &amp; Kinnaur and Kulu on western side through high passes.<br \/>\n<strong>Ladakh\u00a0<\/strong>(\u2018land of the passes\u2019) is one of the most elevated (2,900 m to 5,900 m msl), and coldest regions (from -30\u00b0C to -70\u00b0C) of the earth. In consonance with the above description, its topography is barren and population sparse inhabited along the river banks of different valleys namely Indus, Nubra, Changthang, Zanskar and Suru. The mean annual precipitation is less than 50 mm, received mostly in the form of snowfall during winters. The region faces fast blowing winds 40-60 km\/hr mainly in the afternoon hours. The soil moisture remains frozen during winters and with low relative humidity during the summer months. Despite such inhospitable conditions for survival, it is postulated that Ladakh has been occupied by humans since pre-historic times, as evidenced in the discovery of Lower Palaeolithic tools, Petroglyphs and other pre-historic art works that mark the beginning of man\u2019s interaction with this cold desert landscape. Evidence of its continued occupation can be ascertained throughout history since then, which is closely associated with Tibet.<br \/>\n<strong>Spiti<\/strong>, locally pronounced as \u2018Piti\u2019, is known as the \u2018middle country\u2019 that lies between Tibet and India. Throughout history, it kept changing hands among the various kingdoms of Tibet, Ladakh, Kinnaur, Lahaul and Kullu. Subjugated to successive attacks and influences, rulers paid attributes to one another to keep peace in the region. The original inhabitants were pastoral nomads and worshipped the natural features such as trees, rivers, sun, moon \u2013 the Naga Cult was a cult of snake worship. The river Spiti originates at the base of the Kunzam range and flows eastward to join the Sutlej at Khab in Kinnaur. Spiti has its sub divisional headquarters at Kaza, has 113 villages, of which 81 are permanent settlements and 32 are temporary. The inhabitants are largely dependent on agriculture, wild resources and medicinal plants for their livelihood. About 118 species of the Medicinal and Aromatic Plants are known from the valley.<br \/>\nThe annual average precipitation for Ladakh and Zanskar (J&amp;K) is only around 100 mm while that of Spiti valley (H.P.) is 170 mm as against the annual national average of 1083 mm.<br \/>\nIt is believed that people from Central Asia between Khazakstan and China came to populate these areas during the Bronze Age (circa fourth millenium BCE). They were pastoralists attracted to the valleys and high mountains for summer transhumance.<br \/>\n<strong>Buddhism<\/strong>\u00a0was first introduced to Ladakh about 200 BCE during the reign of Maurya Emperor, Asoka the Great.<br \/>\n<em>Gompas.<\/em>\u00a0Almost all settlements have Buddhist monasteries or Gompas\u00a0with a trademark prayer flag fluttering on top. Built either on flat land or atop the neighbouring hillock depending upon local factors, these shrines are the centers of the people\u2019s cultural life. Men depend on the social security system of the Gompas. The architecture is an interesting amalgamation of Indian and Tibetan influences, and monastic buildings are deeply Buddhist. Each settlement and its Gompa have their own unique associations and the culture.<br \/>\nThe walls of the monasteries are decorated with frescos depicting Buddhist subjects drawn from Buddha\u2019s life and his ideals. Walls are also embellished with thankas (paintings on cloth) displaying Jataka stories and other Buddhist themes. An exceptional thanka, the biggest in the world is ritually exhibited once in twelve years in Hemis monastery.<br \/>\n<em>Chorten\u00a0<\/em>(\u2018receptacle of worship\u2019 types of stupas), and\u00a0Mani walls, long and thick platform-like row of stones, about 1 to 1.25 m high and 1.25 m wide, faced with carved stones inscribed with holy mantras.<br \/>\n<em>Buddhist chanting.<\/em>\u00a0Buddhist lamas in monasteries and villages of Ladakh, Lahul-Spiti and Kinnaur chant sacred texts representing the spirit, philosophy and teachings of the Buddha.<br \/>\n<strong>Culture<\/strong>.\u00a0The performing arts (traditional dance including mask dance, theater, contemporary plays, folk music), craft-making techniques (thangkas, carpet weaving, pashmina and marino shawls and local quilt weaving, prayer flags of cloth, gold, silver, bronze sculptures, copper objects, wooden furniture including manuscript shelves, stone, stucco and clay), customs (sacred paintings, agriculture farming, kitchen-gardening, culinary, giving birth, wedding, death et al), rituals and beliefs (medicinal ritual called Am-chi), language and literature (heroic accomplishments, folk stories, legends, classical and vernacular language, dialects, songs, poems, ancient scripts), etc. are parts of cultural legacy and well-maintained intangible heritage traditions of the property.<b><br \/>\n<\/b><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Hemis National Park, <\/strong><\/em>A high altitude park globally famous for its\u00a0snow leopards.<br \/>\nThe city of\u00a0Leh\u00a0is 10\u00a0km (6.2\u00a0mi) to the north of the park.
