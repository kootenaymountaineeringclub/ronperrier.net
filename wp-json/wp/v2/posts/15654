His brain also lacked a corpus callosum, the thick bundle of white matter that usually coordinates communication between the left and right hemispheres. A doctor told his parents that he was hopelessly retarded and belonged in an institution. But his parents refused.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As an infant, Peek began developing extraordinary cognitive capacities. By 18 months, he had memorized every book his parents read him, word for word. He looked up words in the dictionary at three and sounded them phonetically. He was equally adept with numbers. He read telephone books for fun and total numbers on passing license plates. He could eventually read two pages of a book simultaneously \u2013 one with his right eye and one with his left \u2013 even if they were held upside down or reflected in a mirror.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Permanently excluded from school for being disruptive, he mastered the high school curriculum with the help of tutors by the time he was 14. Taking a job at a sheltered workshop for disabled people, he performed complex payroll calculations without the benefit of an adding machine; one of his nicknames was \u201cthe Kimputer\u201d. Yet he couldn&#8217;t dress or attend to many of his basic needs without help. When he finally learned to shave, he would close his eyes in front of the mirror because he couldn\u2019t stand seeing the sides of his face reversed.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Peek was a savant: a modern version of the prodigiously gifted \u201cidiots\u201d described by 19<sup>th<\/sup>-century clinicians. One was an intellectually disabled boy who had memorized The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire \u2013 albeit in rote, mechanical fashion. Another boy could instantly multiply two three-digit numbers in his head before the doctor could jot them down.<\/p>\n<p><\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Peek\u2019s special abilities were not restricted to one or two narrow domains. He could also recall classical music scores note for note.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>RAIN MAN<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Peek\u2019s father invited the director of the Bill films (played by Mickey Rooney), Barry Morrow, to enlist him to raise public awareness of intellectual disability. Peek reeled off the closing credits from Bill verbatim. As they went over mailing lists, Peek began correcting erroneous zip codes on the fly and was able to recite step-by-step driving instructions between any two points in the United States and Canada. He was also an inexhaustible font of sports trivia. To his parents and a small circle of friends, Peek was an eccentric marvel who spent most of his time alone in his room. To Morrow, he seemed like an extraordinary protagonist searching for a plot. He came up with the script for Rain Man, United Artists was excited to make the movie, and Dustin Hoffman loved the script.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Leading critics took issue with the film in ways that said more about the prevailing views of autism than they did about <em>Rain Man<\/em>. But audiences embraced the film, which grossed nearly $355 million worldwide, making it one of the most financially successful Hollywood releases. In addition to winning Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role, Best Director and Best Screenplay, <em>Rain Man<\/em> won two Golden Globes and a People\u2019s Choice Award.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">More importantly, the public, for the first time, started to understand autism. Autistic children became proud to be autistic. The film made innumerable autistics visible to their loved ones, neighbours, teachers, doctors, and themselves. The character of Raymond Babbit made autism recognizable and familiar to everyone. Dustin Hoffman said, \u201cThe film touches something in us that I can\u2019t explain. We all go through life not hugging as much as we\u2019d like. Something cuts us off . . . We\u2019re always keeping a lid on our autism.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Parents from all over the world wanted to know how to set up NSAC groups. An unprecedented surge of interest in autism spread through mainstream media. Autistics appeared on Oprah and The Larry King Show, performing feats of lightning calculation for the wide-eyed hosts. One film did more for autism than everyone in the NSAC working worldwide had been able to do in 25 years. And <em>Rain Man<\/em> was just the beginning.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>KIM PEEK Kim Peek had been born with cranial Bones that had failed to fuse properly in the womb, so at birth, part of his cortical tissue protruded through a baseball-sized blister at the back of his head.
