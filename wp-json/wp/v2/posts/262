Heavy items go low and concentrated to the middle close to the cockpit. Pack light items in the ends: a heavy bow will cause your kayak to veer to windward, a stern heavy boat will veer downwind; keeping boat ends light helps them lift over waves, heavy ends are sluggish and tend to plunge. Develop a system of packing that doesn&#8217;t vary and gives the best accessibility. Because of all the stuff on the rear deck (paddle float, spare paddle, noodles, pump), all camping gear goes in the rear hatch (tent, sleeping pad, kitchen, most food). The front compartment has a taper dry bag with clothes, dry camp clothes, small tarp, hiking gear and lunch &#8211; all things that might be needed during the day.<br \/>\nHeavy items on the deck compromise stability and create a high profile for wind resistance. Be aware of sharp or hard items such a cooking pots that may wear a weak spot.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Water<\/strong><br \/>\nPlaces: behind seat, in front of feet, rear compartment right behind seat and six litre in front compartment next to cockpit. Use only as many as need depending on water source availability).<br \/>\n<em>Wine Bladders.<\/em> These 4.5 litre bags are cheap, fairly strong and impart no taste to water. They are my choice for carrying water in a kayak. I have sewn 4 nylon bags with carrying straps for my wine bladders.<br \/>\n<em>MSR Dromedary bags<\/em> (6 and 10 liter) are ideal for carrying a lot of water in a kayak as they are indestructible, have three ways to pour water, great nylon strap for easy carrying and conform to any space and take up no room when empty BUT they had and still have, a big problem with a plastic odour that makes the water totally unpalatable and is impossible to get rid of. MSR replaced my three 10-litre and one 6-litre dromedary bags but these new bags are no better.<br \/>\n<em>1.89 litre plastic juice bottles<\/em>. Cheap but don\u2019t conform.
