With one immediate exception, Trump\u2019s predecessors made their way to high office through the passive power of whiteness\u2014that bloody heirloom which cannot ensure mastery of all events but can conjure a tailwind for most of them. Land theft and human plunder cleared the grounds for Trump\u2019s forefathers and barred others from it. Once upon the field, these men became soldiers, statesmen, and scholars; held court in Paris; presided at Princeton; advanced into the Wilderness and then into the White House. Their individual triumphs made this exclusive party seem above America\u2019s founding sins, and it was forgotten that the former was in fact bound to the latter, that all their victories had transpired on cleared grounds. No such elegant detachment can be attributed to Donald Trump\u2014a president who, more than any other, has made the awful inheritance explicit.<\/span><\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-2\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">His political career began in advocacy of birtherism, that modern recasting of the old American precept that black people are not fit to be citizens of the country they built. But long before birtherism, Trump had made his worldview clear. He fought to keep blacks out of his buildings, according to the U.S. government; called for the death penalty for the eventually exonerated Central Park Five; and railed against \u201clazy\u201d black employees. \u201cBlack guys counting my money! I hate it,\u201d Trump was once quoted as saying. \u201cThe only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day.\u201d After his cabal of conspiracy theorists forced Barack Obama to present his birth certificate, Trump demanded the president\u2019s college grades (offering $5 million in exchange for them), insisting that Obama was not intelligent enough to have gone to an Ivy League school, and that his acclaimed memoir, <i>Dreams From My Father<\/i>, had been ghostwritten by a white man, Bill Ayers.<\/span><\/p>\n<aside class=\"callout subscribe\"><\/aside>\n<p>It is often said that Trump has no real ideology, which is not true\u2014his ideology is white supremacy, in all its truculent and sanctimonious power. Trump inaugurated his campaign by casting himself as the defender of white maidenhood against Mexican \u201crapists,\u201d only to be later alleged by multiple accusers, and by his own proud words, to be a sexual violator himself. White supremacy has always had a perverse sexual tint. Trump\u2019s rise was shepherded by Steve Bannon, a man who mocks his white male critics as \u201ccucks.\u201d The word, derived from <i>cuckold<\/i>, is specifically meant to debase by fear and fantasy\u2014the target is so weak that he would submit to the humiliation of having his white wife lie with black men. That the slur <i>cuck<\/i>casts white men as victims aligns with the dicta of whiteness, which seek to alchemize one\u2019s profligate sins into virtue. So it was with Virginia slaveholders claiming that Britain sought to make slaves of them. So it was with marauding Klansmen organized against alleged rapes and other outrages. So it was with a candidate who called for a foreign power to hack his opponent\u2019s email and who now, as president, is claiming to be the victim of \u201cthe single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-3\">In Trump, white supremacists see one of their own. Only grudgingly did Trump denounce the Ku Klux Klan and David Duke, one of its former grand wizards\u2014and after the clashes between white supremacists and counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August, Duke in turn praised Trump\u2019s contentious claim that \u201cboth sides\u201d were responsible for the violence.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Trump\u2019s political career began in advocacy of birtherism. But long before that, he had made his worldview clear.<\/span><\/aside>\n<p>To Trump, whiteness is neither notional nor symbolic but is the very core of his power. In this, Trump is not singular. But whereas his forebears carried whiteness like an ancestral talisman, Trump cracked the glowing amulet open, releasing its eldritch energies. The repercussions are striking: Trump is the first president to have served in no public capacity before ascending to his perch. But more telling, Trump is also the first president to have publicly affirmed that his daughter is a \u201cpiece of ass.\u201d The mind seizes trying to imagine a black man extolling the virtues of sexual assault on tape (\u201cWhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it\u201d), fending off multiple accusations of such assaults, immersed in multiple lawsuits for allegedly fraudulent business dealings, exhorting his followers to violence, and then strolling into the White House. But that is the point of white supremacy\u2014to ensure that that which all others achieve with maximal effort, white people (particularly white men) achieve with minimal qualification. Barack Obama delivered to black people the hoary message that if they work twice as hard as white people, anything is possible. But Trump\u2019s counter is persuasive: Work half as hard as black people, and even more is possible.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-4\">For Trump, it almost seems that the fact of Obama, the fact of a black president, insulted him personally. The insult intensified when Obama and Seth Meyers publicly humiliated him at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner in 2011. But the bloody heirloom ensures the last laugh. Replacing Obama is not enough\u2014Trump has made the negation of Obama\u2019s legacy the foundation of his own. And this too is whiteness. \u201cRace is an idea, not a fact,\u201d the historian Nell Irvin Painter has written, and essential to the construct of a \u201cwhite race\u201d is the idea of not being a nigger. Before Barack Obama, niggers could be manufactured out of Sister Souljahs, Willie Hortons, and Dusky Sallys. But Donald Trump arrived in the wake of something more potent\u2014an entire nigger presidency with nigger health care, nigger climate accords, and nigger justice reform, all of which could be targeted for destruction or redemption, thus reifying the idea of being white. Trump truly is something new\u2014the first president whose entire political existence hinges on the fact of a black president. And so it will not suffice to say that Trump is a white man like all the others who rose to become president. He must be called by his rightful honorific\u2014America\u2019s first white president.<b>THE SCOPE OF <\/b><b>TRUMP\u2019S<\/b> commitment to whiteness is matched only by the depth of popular disbelief in the power of whiteness. We are now being told that support for Trump\u2019s \u201cMuslim ban,\u201d his scapegoating of immigrants, his defenses of police brutality are somehow the natural outgrowth of the cultural and economic gap between Lena Dunham\u2019s America and Jeff Foxworthy\u2019s. The collective verdict holds that the Democratic Party lost its way when it abandoned everyday economic issues like job creation for the softer fare of social justice. The indictment continues: To their neoliberal economics, Democrats and liberals have married a condescending elitist affect that sneers at blue-collar culture and mocks the white man as history\u2019s greatest monster and prime-time television\u2019s biggest doofus. In this rendition, Donald Trump is not the product of white supremacy so much as the product of a backlash against contempt for white working-class people.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-5\">\u201cWe so obviously despise them, we so obviously condescend to them,\u201d the conservative social scientist Charles Murray, who co-wrote <i>The Bell Curve<\/i>, recently told <i>The New Yorker<\/i>, speaking of the white working class. \u201cThe only slur you can use at a dinner party and get away with is to call somebody a redneck\u2014that won\u2019t give you any problems in Manhattan.\u201d<\/p>\n<aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">White Americans elected an orcish reality-TV star who insists on taking his intelligence briefings in picture-book form.<\/span><\/aside>\n<p>\u201cThe utter contempt with which privileged Eastern liberals such as myself discuss red-state, gun-country, working-class America as ridiculous and morons and rubes,\u201d charged the celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain, \u201cis largely responsible for the upswell of rage and contempt and desire to pull down the temple that we\u2019re seeing now.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That black people, who have lived for centuries under such derision and condescension, have not yet been driven into the arms of Trump does not trouble these theoreticians. After all, in this analysis, Trump\u2019s racism and the racism of his supporters are incidental to his rise. Indeed, the alleged glee with which liberals call out Trump\u2019s bigotry is assigned even more power than the bigotry itself. Ostensibly assaulted by campus protests, battered by arguments about intersectionality, and oppressed by new bathroom rights, a blameless white working class did the only thing any reasonable polity might: elect an orcish reality-television star who insists on taking his intelligence briefings in picture-book form.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<figure class=\"full-width\"><picture><\/picture><figcaption class=\"caption\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The Republican National Convention, Cleveland, July 2016. According to preelection polling, if you tallied only white voters, Trump would have defeated Clinton 389 to 81 in the Electoral College. (Gabriella Demczuk)<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<section id=\"article-section-6\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Asserting that Trump\u2019s rise was primarily powered by cultural resentment and economic reversal has become de rigueur among white pundits and thought leaders. But evidence for this is, at best, mixed. In a study of preelection polling data, the Gallup researchers Jonathan Rothwell and Pablo Diego-Rosell found that \u201cpeople living in areas with diminished economic opportunity\u201d were \u201csomewhat more likely to support Trump.\u201d But the researchers also found that voters in their study who supported Trump generally had a higher mean household income ($81,898) than those who did not ($77,046). Those who approved of Trump were \u201cless likely to be unemployed and less likely to be employed part-time\u201d than those who did not. They also tended to be from areas that were very white: \u201cThe racial and ethnic isolation of whites at the zip code level is one of the strongest predictors of Trump support.\u201d<\/span><\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-7\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">An analysis of exit polls conducted during the presidential primaries estimated the median household income of Trump supporters to be about $72,000. But even this lower number is almost double the median household income of African Americans, and $15,000 above the American median. Trump\u2019s white support was not determined by income. According to Edison Research, Trump won whites making less than $50,000 by 20 points, whites making $50,000 to $99,999 by 28 points, and whites making $100,000 or more by 14 points. This shows that Trump assembled a broad white coalition that ran the gamut from Joe the Dishwasher to Joe the Plumber to Joe the Banker. So when white pundits cast the elevation of Trump as the handiwork of an inscrutable white working class, they are being too modest, declining to claim credit for their own economic class. Trump\u2019s dominance among whites across class lines is of a piece with his larger dominance across nearly every white demographic. Trump won white women (+9) and white men (+31). He won white people with college degrees (+3) and white people without them (+37). He won whites ages 18\u201329 (+4), 30\u201344 (+17), 45\u201364 (+28), and 65 and older (+19). Trump won whites in midwestern Illinois (+11), whites in mid-Atlantic New Jersey (+12), and whites in the Sun Belt\u2019s New Mexico (+5). In no state that Edison polled did Trump\u2019s white support dip below 40 percent. Hillary Clinton\u2019s did, in states as disparate as Florida, Utah, Indiana, and Kentucky. From the beer track to the wine track, from soccer moms to <span class=\"smallcaps\">nascar<\/span>dads, Trump\u2019s performance among whites was dominant. According to <i>Mother Jones<\/i>, based on preelection polling data, if you tallied the popular vote of only white America to derive 2016 electoral votes, Trump would have defeated Clinton 389 to 81, with the remaining 68 votes either a toss-up or unknown.<\/span><\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-8\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Part of Trump\u2019s dominance among whites resulted from his running as a Republican, the party that has long cultivated white voters. Trump\u2019s share of the white vote was similar to Mitt Romney\u2019s in 2012. But unlike Romney, Trump secured this support by running against his party\u2019s leadership, against accepted campaign orthodoxy, and against all notions of decency. By his sixth month in office, embroiled in scandal after scandal, a Pew Research Center poll found Trump\u2019s approval rating underwater with every single demographic group. Every demographic group, that is, except one: people who identified as white.<\/span>The focus on one subsector of Trump voters\u2014the white working class\u2014is puzzling, given the breadth of his white coalition. Indeed, there is a kind of theater at work in which Trump\u2019s presidency is pawned off as a product of the white working class as opposed to a product of an entire whiteness that includes the very authors doing the pawning. The motive is clear: escapism. To accept that the bloody heirloom remains potent even now, some five decades after Martin Luther King Jr. was gunned down on a Memphis balcony\u2014even after a black president; indeed, strengthened by the fact of that black president\u2014is to accept that racism remains, as it has since 1776, at the heart of this country\u2019s political life. The idea of acceptance frustrates the left. The left would much rather have a discussion about class struggles, which might entice the white working masses, instead of about the racist struggles that those same masses have historically been the agents and beneficiaries of. Moreover, to accept that whiteness brought us Donald Trump is to accept whiteness as an existential danger to the country and the world. But if the broad and remarkable white support for Donald Trump can be reduced to the righteous anger of a noble class of smallville firefighters and evangelicals, mocked by Brooklyn hipsters and womanist professors into voting against their interests, then the threat of racism and whiteness, the threat of the heirloom, can be dismissed. Consciences can be eased; no deeper existential reckoning is required.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">An opioid epidemic is greeted with calls for compassion and treatment; a crack epidemic is greeted with scorn and mandatory minimums.<\/span><\/aside>\n<p>This transfiguration is not novel. It is a return to form. The tightly intertwined stories of the white working class and black Americans go back to the prehistory of the United States\u2014and the use of one as a cudgel to silence the claims of the other goes back nearly as far. Like the black working class, the white working class originated in bondage\u2014the former in the lifelong bondage of slavery, the latter in the temporary bondage of indenture. In the early 17th century, these two classes were remarkably, though not totally, free of racist enmity. But by the 18th century, the country\u2019s master class had begun etching race into law while phasing out indentured servitude in favor of a more enduring labor solution. From these and other changes of law and economy, a bargain emerged: The descendants of indenture would enjoy the full benefits of whiteness, the most definitional benefit being that they would never sink to the level of the slave. But if the bargain protected white workers from slavery, it did not protect them from near-slave wages or backbreaking labor to attain them, and always there lurked a fear of having their benefits revoked. This early white working class \u201cexpressed soaring desires to be rid of the age-old inequalities of Europe and of any hint of slavery,\u201d according to David R. Roediger, a professor of American studies at the University of Kansas. \u201cThey also expressed the rather more pedestrian goal of simply not being mistaken for slaves, or \u2018negers\u2019 or \u2018negurs.\u2019\u2009\u201d<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-9\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Roediger relates the experience, around 1807, of a British investor who made the mistake of asking a white maid in New England whether her \u201cmaster\u201d was home. The maid admonished the investor, not merely for implying that she had a \u201cmaster\u201d and thus was a \u201csarvant\u201d but for his basic ignorance of American hierarchy. \u201cNone but negers are sarvants,\u201d the maid is reported to have said. In law and economics and then in custom, a racist distinction not limited to the household emerged between the \u201chelp\u201d (or the \u201cfreemen,\u201d or the white workers) and the \u201cservants\u201d (the \u201cnegers,\u201d the slaves). The former were virtuous and just, worthy of citizenship, progeny of Jefferson and, later, Jackson. The latter were servile and parasitic, dim-witted and lazy, the children of African savagery. But the dignity accorded to white labor was situational, dependent on the scorn heaped upon black labor\u2014much as the honor accorded a \u201cvirtuous lady\u201d was dependent on the derision directed at a \u201cloose woman.\u201d And like chivalrous gentlemen who claim to honor the lady while raping the \u201cwhore,\u201d planters and their apologists could claim to honor white labor while driving the enslaved.<\/span>And so George Fitzhugh, a prominent 19th-century Southern pro-slavery intellectual, could in a single stroke deplore the exploitation of free whites\u2019 labor while defending the exploitation of enslaved blacks\u2019 labor. Fitzhugh attacked white capitalists as \u201ccannibals,\u201d feeding off the labor of their fellow whites. The white workers were \u201c\u2009\u2018slaves without masters;\u2019 the little fish, who were food for all the larger.\u201d Fitzhugh inveighed against a \u201cprofessional man\u201d who\u2019d \u201camassed a fortune\u201d by exploiting his fellow whites. But whereas Fitzhugh imagined white workers as devoured by capital, he imagined black workers as elevated by enslavement. The slaveholder \u201cprovided for them, with almost parental affection\u201d\u2014even when the loafing slave \u201cfeigned to be unfit for labor.\u201d Fitzhugh proved too explicit\u2014going so far as to argue that white laborers might be better off if enslaved. (\u201cIf white slavery be morally wrong,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe Bible cannot be true.\u201d) Nevertheless, the argument that America\u2019s original sin was not deep-seated white supremacy but rather the exploitation of white labor by white capitalists\u2014\u201cwhite slavery\u201d\u2014proved durable. Indeed, the panic of white slavery lives on in our politics today. Black workers suffer because it was and is our lot. But when white workers suffer, something in nature has gone awry. And so an opioid epidemic among mostly white people is greeted with calls for compassion and treatment, as all epidemics should be, while a crack epidemic among mostly black people is greeted with scorn and mandatory minimums. Sympathetic op\u2011ed columns and articles are devoted to the plight of working-class whites when their life expectancy plummets to levels that, for blacks, society has simply accepted as normal. White slavery is sin. Nigger slavery is natural. This dynamic serves a very real purpose: the consistent awarding of grievance and moral high ground to that class of workers which, by the bonds of whiteness, stands closest to America\u2019s aristocratic class.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-10\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">This is by design. Speaking in 1848, Senator John C. Calhoun saw slavery as the explicit foundation for a democratic union among whites, working and not:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>With us the two great divisions of society are not the rich and poor, but white and black; and all the former, the poor as well as the rich, belong to the upper class, and are respected and treated as equals.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>On the eve of secession, Jefferson Davis, the eventual president of the Confederacy, pushed the idea further, arguing that such equality between the white working class and white oligarchs could not exist at all without black slavery:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I say that the lower race of human beings that constitute the substratum of what is termed the slave population of the South, elevates every white man in our community \u2026 It is the presence of a lower caste, those lower by their mental and physical organization, controlled by the higher intellect of the white man, that gives this superiority to the white laborer. Menial services are not there performed by the white man. We have none of our brethren sunk to the degradation of being menials. That belongs to the lower race\u2014the descendants of Ham.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Southern intellectuals found a shade of agreement with Northern white reformers who, while not agreeing on slavery, agreed on the nature of the most tragic victim of emerging capitalism. \u201cI was formerly like yourself, sir, a very warm advocate of the abolition of slavery,\u201d the labor reformer George Henry Evans argued in a letter to the abolitionist Gerrit Smith. \u201cThis was before I saw that there was <i>white<\/i> slavery.\u201d Evans was a putative ally of Smith and his fellow abolitionists. But still he asserted that \u201cthe landless white\u201d was worse off than the enslaved black, who at least enjoyed \u201csurety of support in sickness and old age.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-11\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Invokers of \u201cwhite slavery\u201d held that there was nothing unique in the enslavement of blacks when measured against the enslavement of all workers. What evil there was in enslavement resulted from its status as a subsidiary of the broader exploitation better seen among the country\u2019s noble laboring whites. Once the larger problem of white exploitation was solved, the dependent problem of black exploitation could be confronted or perhaps would fade away. Abolitionists focused on slavery were dismissed as \u201csubstitutionists\u201d who wished to trade one form of slavery for another. \u201cIf I am less troubled concerning the Slavery prevalent in Charleston or New-Orleans,\u201d wrote the reformer Horace Greeley, \u201cit is because I see so much Slavery in New-York, which appears to claim my first efforts.\u201d<\/span>Firsthand reports by white Union soldiers who witnessed actual slavery during the Civil War rendered the \u201cwhite slavery\u201d argument ridiculous. But its operating premises\u2014white labor as noble archetype, and black labor as something else\u2014lived on. This was a matter of rhetoric, not fact. The noble-white-labor archetype did not give white workers immunity from capitalism. It could not, in itself, break monopolies, alleviate white poverty in Appalachia or the South, or bring a decent wage to immigrant ghettos in the North. But the model for America\u2019s original identity politics was set. Black lives literally did not matter and could be cast aside altogether as the price of even incremental gains for the white masses. It was this juxtaposition that allowed Theodore Bilbo to campaign for the Senate in the 1930s as someone who would \u201craise the same kind of hell as President Roosevelt\u201d and later endorse lynching black people to keep them from voting.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-12\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The juxtaposition between the valid and even virtuous interests of the \u201cworking class\u201d and the invalid and pathological interests of black Americans was not the province merely of blatant white supremacists like Bilbo. The acclaimed scholar, liberal hero, and future senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, in his time working for President Richard Nixon, approvingly quoted Nixon\u2019s formulation of the white working class: \u201cA new voice\u201d was beginning to make itself felt in the country. \u201cIt is a voice that has been silent too long,\u201d Nixon claimed, alluding to working-class whites. \u201cIt is a voice of people who have not taken to the streets before, who have not indulged in violence, who have not broken the law.\u201d<\/span><\/section>\n<figure class=\"full-width\"><picture><\/picture><figcaption class=\"caption\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The fact of a black president seemed to insult Donald Trump personally.

But as the myth of the virtuous white working class was made central to American identity, its sins needed to be rendered invisible. The fact was, working-class whites had been agents of racist terrorism since at least the draft riots of 1863; terrorism could not be neatly separated from the racist animus found in every class of whites. Indeed, in the era of lynching, the daily newspapers often whipped up the fury of the white masses by invoking the last species of property that all white men held in common\u2014white women. But to conceal the breadth of white racism, these racist outbursts were often disregarded or treated not as racism but as the unfortunate side effect of legitimate grievances against capital. By focusing on that sympathetic laboring class, the sins of whiteness itself were, and are still being, evaded.<\/span><\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-14\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">When David Duke, the former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, shocked the country in 1990 by almost winning one of Louisiana\u2019s seats in the U.S. Senate, the apologists came out once again. They elided the obvious\u2014that Duke had appealed to the racist instincts of a state whose schools are, at this very moment, still desegregating\u2014and instead decided that something else was afoot. \u201cThere is a tremendous amount of anger and frustration among working-class whites, particularly where there is an economic downturn,\u201d a researcher told the <i>Los Angeles Times<\/i>. \u201cThese people feel left out; they feel government is not responsive to them.\u201d By this logic, postwar America\u2014with its booming economy and low unemployment\u2014should have been an egalitarian utopia and not the violently segregated country it actually was.<\/span>But this was the past made present. It was not important to the apologists that a large swath of Louisiana\u2019s white population thought it was a good idea to send a white supremacist who once fronted a terrorist organization to the nation\u2019s capital. Nor was it important that blacks in Louisiana had long felt left out. What was important was the fraying of an ancient bargain, and the potential degradation of white workers to the level of \u201cnegers.\u201d \u201cA viable left must find a way to differentiate itself strongly from such analysis,\u201d David Roediger, the University of Kansas professor, has written.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-15\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">That challenge of differentiation has largely been ignored. Instead, an imagined white working class remains central to our politics and to our cultural understanding of those politics, not simply when it comes to addressing broad economic issues but also when it comes to addressing racism. At its most sympathetic, this belief holds that most Americans\u2014regardless of race\u2014are exploited by an unfettered capitalist economy. The key, then, is to address those broader patterns that afflict the masses of all races; the people who suffer from those patterns more than others (blacks, for instance) will benefit disproportionately from that which benefits everyone. \u201cThese days, what ails working-class and middle-class blacks and Latinos is not fundamentally different from what ails their white counterparts,\u201d Senator Barack Obama wrote in 2006:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Downsizing, outsourcing, automation, wage stagnation, the dismantling of employer-based health-care and pension plans, and schools that fail to teach young people the skills they need to compete in a global economy.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Obama allowed that \u201cblacks in particular have been vulnerable to these trends\u201d\u2014but less because of racism than for reasons of geography and job-sector distribution. This notion\u2014raceless antiracism\u2014marks the modern left, from the New Democrat Bill Clinton to the socialist Bernie Sanders. Few national liberal politicians have shown any recognition that there is something systemic and particular in the relationship between black people and their country that might require specific policy solutions.<\/p>\n<p><b>IN 2016, HILLARY <\/b><b>CLINTON<\/b> acknowledged the existence of systemic racism more explicitly than any of her modern Democratic predecessors.

While her husband\u2019s administration had touted the rising-tide theory of economic growth, it did so while slashing welfare and getting \u201ctough on crime,\u201d a phrase that stood for specific policies but also served as rhetorical bait for white voters. One is tempted to excuse Hillary Clinton from having to answer for the sins of her husband. But in her 2008 campaign, she evoked the old dichotomy between white workers and loafing blacks, claiming to be the representative of \u201chardworking Americans, white Americans.\u201d By the end of the 2008 primary campaign against Barack Obama, her advisers were hoping someone would uncover an apocryphal \u201cwhitey tape,\u201d in which an angry Michelle Obama was alleged to have used the slur. During Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential-reelection campaign in the mid-1990s, Hillary Clinton herself had endorsed the \u201csuper-predator\u201d theory of William J. Bennett, John P. Walters, and John J. DiIulio Jr. This theory cast \u201cinner-city\u201d children of that era as \u201calmost completely unmoralized\u201d and the font of \u201ca new generation of street criminals \u2026 the youngest, biggest and baddest generation any society has ever known.\u201d The \u201cbaddest generation\u201d did not become super-predators. But by 2016, they were young adults, many of whom judged Hillary Clinton\u2019s newfound consciousness to be lacking.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-16\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">It\u2019s worth asking why the country has not been treated to a raft of sympathetic portraits of this \u201cforgotten\u201d young black electorate, forsaken by a Washington bought off by Davos elites and special interests. The unemployment rate for young blacks (20.6 percent) in July 2016 was double that of young whites (9.9 percent). And since the late 1970s, William Julius Wilson and other social scientists following in his wake have noted the disproportionate effect that the decline in manufacturing jobs has had on African American communities. If anyone should be angered by the devastation wreaked by the financial sector and a government that declined to prosecute the perpetrators, it is African Americans\u2014the housing crisis was one of the primary drivers in the past 20 years of the wealth gap between black families and the rest of the country. But the cultural condescension toward and economic anxiety of black people is not news. Toiling blacks are in their proper state; toiling whites raise the specter of white slavery.<\/span>Moreover, a narrative of long-neglected working-class black voters, injured by globalization and the financial crisis, forsaken by out-of-touch politicians, and rightfully suspicious of a return of Clintonism, does not serve to cleanse the conscience of white people for having elected Donald Trump. Only the idea of a long-suffering white working class can do that. And though much has been written about the distance between elites and \u201cReal America,\u201d the existence of a class-transcending, mutually dependent tribe of white people is evident.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-17\">Joe Biden, then the vice president, last year:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all the people I grew up with \u2026 And they\u2019re not racist.

I think they\u2019re profoundly wrong, but please don\u2019t dismiss them as hateful bigots.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>These claims of origin and fidelity are not merely elite defenses of an aggrieved class but also a sweeping dismissal of the concerns of those who don\u2019t share kinship with white men. \u201cYou can\u2019t eat equality,\u201d asserts Joe Biden\u2014a statement worthy of someone unthreatened by the loss of wages brought on by an unwanted pregnancy, a background-check box at the bottom of a job application, or the deportation of a breadwinner. Within a week of Sanders lambasting Democrats for not speaking to \u201cthe people\u201d where he \u201ccame from,\u201d he was making an example of a woman who dreamed of representing the people where she came from. Confronted with a young woman who hoped to become the second Latina senator in American history, Sanders responded with a parody of the Clinton campaign: \u201cIt is not good enough for someone to say, \u2018I\u2019m a woman! Vote for me!\u2019 No, that\u2019s not good enough \u2026 One of the struggles that you\u2019re going to be seeing in the Democratic Party is whether we go beyond identity politics.\u201d The upshot\u2014attacking one specimen of identity politics after having invoked another\u2014was unfortunate.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<figure class=\"full-width\"><picture><\/picture><figcaption class=\"caption\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The KKK and counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, July 8, 2017.

(Gabriella Demczuk)<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<section id=\"article-section-18\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Other Sanders appearances proved even more alarming. On MSNBC, he attributed Trump\u2019s success, in part, to his willingness to \u201cnot be politically correct.\u201d Sanders admitted that Trump had \u201csaid some outrageous and painful things, but I think people are tired of the same old, same old political rhetoric.\u201d Pressed on the definition of political correctness, Sanders gave an answer Trump surely would have approved of. \u201cWhat it means is you have a set of talking points which have been poll-tested and focus-group-tested,\u201d Sanders explained. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what you say rather than what\u2019s really going on. And often, what you are not allowed to say are things which offend very, very powerful people.\u201d<\/span><\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-19\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">This definition of political correctness was shocking coming from a politician of the left. But it matched a broader defense of Trump voters. \u201cSome people think that the people who voted for Trump are racists and sexists and homophobes and just deplorable folks,\u201d Sanders said later. \u201cI don\u2019t agree.\u201d This is not exculpatory. Certainly not every Trump voter is a white supremacist, just as not every white person in the Jim Crow South was a white supremacist. But every Trump voter felt it acceptable to hand the fate of the country over to one.<\/span>One can, to some extent, understand politicians\u2019 embracing a self-serving identity politics. Candidates for high office, such as Sanders, have to cobble together a coalition. The white working class is seen, understandably, as a large cache of potential votes, and capturing these votes requires eliding uncomfortable truths. But journalists have no such excuse. Again and again in the past year, Nicholas Kristof could be found pleading with his fellow liberals not to dismiss his old comrades in the white working class as bigots\u2014even when their bigotry was evidenced in his own reporting. A visit to Tulsa, Oklahoma, finds Kristof wondering why Trump voters support a president who threatens to cut the programs they depend on. But the problem, according to Kristof \u2019s interviewees, isn\u2019t Trump\u2019s attack on benefits so much as an attack on <i>their <\/i>benefits. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of wasteful spending, so cut other places,\u201d one man tells Kristof. When Kristof pushes his subjects to identify that wasteful spending, a fascinating target is revealed: \u201cObama phones,\u201d the products of a fevered conspiracy theory that turned a long-standing government program into a scheme through which the then-president gave away free cellphones to undeserving blacks. Kristof doesn\u2019t shift his analysis based on this comment and, aside from a one-sentence fact-check tucked between parentheses, continues on as though it were never said.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-20\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Observing a Trump supporter in the act of deploying racism does not much perturb Kristof. That is because his defenses of the innate goodness of Trump voters and of the innate goodness of the white working class are in fact defenses of neither. On the contrary, the white working class functions rhetorically not as a real community of people so much as a tool to quiet the demands of those who want a more inclusive America.<\/span>Mark Lilla\u2019s <i>New York Times <\/i>essay \u201cThe End of Identity Liberalism,\u201d published not long after last year\u2019s election, is perhaps the most profound example of this genre. Lilla denounces the perversion of liberalism into \u201ca kind of moral panic about racial, gender and sexual identity,\u201d which distorted liberalism\u2019s message \u201cand prevented it from becoming a unifying force capable of governing.\u201d Liberals have turned away from their working-class base, he says, and must look to the \u201cpre-identity liberalism\u201d of Bill Clinton and Franklin D. Roosevelt. You would never know from this essay that Bill Clinton was one of the most skillful identity politicians of his era\u2014flying home to Arkansas to see a black man, the lobotomized Ricky Ray Rector, executed; upstaging Jesse Jackson at his own conference; signing the Defense of Marriage Act. Nor would you know that the \u201cpre-identity\u201d liberal champion Roosevelt depended on the literally lethal identity politics of the white-supremacist \u201csolid South.\u201d The name Barack Obama does not appear in Lilla\u2019s essay, and he never attempts to grapple, one way or another, with the fact that it was identity politics\u2014the possibility of the first black president\u2014that brought a record number of black voters to the polls, winning the election for the Democratic Party, and thus enabling the deliverance of the ancient liberal goal of national health care. \u201cIdentity politics \u2026 is largely expressive, not persuasive,\u201d Lilla claims. \u201cWhich is why it never wins elections\u2014but can lose them.\u201d That Trump ran and won on identity politics is beyond Lilla\u2019s powers of conception. What appeals to the white working class is ennobled. What appeals to black workers, and all others outside the tribe, is dastardly identitarianism. All politics are identity politics\u2014except the politics of white people, the politics of the bloody heirloom.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-21\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">White tribalism haunts even more-nuanced writers. George Packer\u2019s <i>New Yorker <\/i>essay \u201cThe Unconnected\u201d is a lengthy plea for liberals to focus more on the white working class, a population that \u201chas succumbed to the ills that used to be associated with the black urban \u2018underclass.\u2019\u2009\u201d Packer believes that these ills, and the Democratic Party\u2019s failure to respond to them, explain much of Trump\u2019s rise. Packer offers no opinion polls to weigh white workers\u2019 views on \u201celites,\u201d much less their views on racism. He offers no sense of how their views and their relationship to Trump differ from other workers\u2019 and other whites\u2019.<\/span>That is likely because any empirical evaluation of the relationship between Trump and the white working class would reveal that one adjective in that phrase is doing more work than the other. In 2016, Trump enjoyed majority or plurality support among every economic branch of whites. It is true that his strongest support among whites came from those making $50,000 to $99,999. This would be something more than working-class in many nonwhite neighborhoods, but even if one accepts that branch as the working class, the difference between how various groups in this income bracket voted is revealing. Sixty-one percent of whites in this \u201cworking class\u201d supported Trump. Only 24 percent of Hispanics and 11 percent of blacks did. Indeed, the plurality of all voters making less than $100,000 and the majority making less than $50,000 voted for the Democratic candidate. So when Packer laments the fact that \u201cDemocrats can no longer really claim to be the party of working people\u2014not white ones, anyway,\u201d he commits a kind of category error. The real problem is that Democrats aren\u2019t the party of white people\u2014working or otherwise. White workers are not divided by the fact of labor from other white demographics; they are divided from all other laborers by the fact of their whiteness.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-22\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Packer\u2019s essay was published before the election, and so the vote tally was not available. But it should not be surprising that a Republican candidate making a direct appeal to racism would drive up the numbers among white voters, given that racism has been a dividing line for the national parties since the civil-rights era. Packer finds inspiration for his thesis in West Virginia\u2014a state that remained Democratic through the 1990s before turning decisively Republican, at least at the level of presidential politics. This relatively recent rightward movement evinces, to Packer, a shift \u201cthat couldn\u2019t be attributed just to the politics of race.\u201d This is likely true\u2014the politics of race are, themselves, never attributable \u201cjust to the politics of race.\u201d The history of slavery is also about the growth of international capitalism; the history of lynching must be seen in light of anxiety over the growing independence of women; the civil-rights movement can\u2019t be disentangled from the Cold War. Thus, to say that the rise of Donald Trump is about more than race is to make an empty statement, one that is small comfort to the people\u2014black, Muslim, immigrant\u2014who live under racism\u2019s boot.<\/span>The dent of racism is not hard to detect in West Virginia. In the 2008 Democratic primary there, 95 percent of the voters were white. Twenty percent of those\u2014one in five\u2014openly admitted that race was influencing their vote, and more than 80 percent voted for Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama. Four years later, the incumbent Obama lost the primary in 10 counties to Keith Judd, a white felon incarcerated in a federal prison; Judd racked up more than 40 percent of the Democratic-primary vote in the state. A simple thought experiment: Can one imagine a black felon in a federal prison running in a primary against an incumbent white president doing so well?<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-23\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">But racism occupies a mostly passive place in Packer\u2019s essay. There\u2019s no attempt to understand why black and brown workers, victimized by the same new economy and cosmopolitan elite that Packer lambastes, did not join the Trump revolution. Like Kristof, Packer is gentle with his subjects. When a woman \u201cexploded\u201d and told Packer, \u201cI want to eat what I want to eat, and for them to tell me I can\u2019t eat French fries or Coca-Cola\u2014no way,\u201d he sees this as a rebellion against \u201cthe moral superiority of elites.\u201d In fact, this elite conspiracy dates back to 1894, when the government first began advising Americans on their diets. As recently as 2002, President George W. Bush launched the HealthierUS initiative, urging Americans to exercise and eat healthy food. But Packer never allows himself to wonder whether the explosion he witnessed had anything to do with the fact that similar advice now came from the country\u2019s first black first lady. Packer concludes that Obama was leaving the country \u201cmore divided and angrier than most Americans can remember,\u201d a statement that is likely true only because most Americans identify as white. Certainly the men and women forced to live in the wake of the beating of John Lewis, the lynching of Emmett Till, the firebombing of Percy Julian\u2019s home, and the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Medgar Evers would disagree.<\/span><\/p>\n<aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Trump\u2019s legacy will be exposing the patina of decency for what it is and revealing just how much a demagogue can get away with.<\/span><\/aside>\n<p>The triumph of Trump\u2019s campaign of bigotry presented the problematic spectacle of an American president succeeding at best in spite of his racism and possibly because of it. Trump moved racism from the euphemistic and plausibly deniable to the overt and freely claimed. This presented the country\u2019s thinking class with a dilemma. Hillary Clinton simply could not be correct when she asserted that a large group of Americans was endorsing a candidate because of bigotry. The implications\u2014that systemic bigotry is still central to our politics; that the country is susceptible to such bigotry; that the salt-of-the-earth Americans whom we lionize in our culture and politics are not so different from those same Americans who grin back at us in lynching photos; that Calhoun\u2019s aim of a pan-Caucasian embrace between workers and capitalists still endures\u2014were just too dark. Leftists would have to cope with the failure, yet again, of class unity in the face of racism. Incorporating all of this into an analysis of America and the path forward proved too much to ask. Instead, the response has largely been an argument aimed at emotion\u2014the summoning of the white working class, emblem of America\u2019s hardscrabble roots, inheritor of its pioneer spirit, as a shield against the horrific and empirical evidence of trenchant bigotry.<\/p>\n<p>Packer dismisses the Democratic Party as a coalition of \u201crising professionals and diversity.\u201d The dismissal is derived from, of all people, Lawrence Summers, the former Harvard president and White House economist, who last year labeled the Democratic Party \u201ca coalition of the cosmopolitan \u00e9lite and diversity.\u201d The inference is that the party has forgotten how to speak on hard economic issues and prefers discussing presumably softer cultural issues such as \u201cdiversity.\u201d It\u2019s worth unpacking what, precisely, falls under this rubric of \u201cdiversity\u201d\u2014resistance to the monstrous incarceration of legions of black men, resistance to the destruction of health providers for poor women, resistance to the effort to deport parents, resistance to a policing whose sole legitimacy is rooted in brute force, resistance to a theory of education that preaches \u201cno excuses\u201d to black and brown children, even as excuses are proffered for mendacious corporate executives \u201ctoo big to jail.\u201d That this suite of concerns, taken together, can be dismissed by both an elite economist like Summers and a brilliant journalist like Packer as \u201cdiversity\u201d simply reveals the safe space they enjoy. Because of their identity.<\/p>\n<p><b>WHEN BARACK OBAMA<\/b> came into office, in 2009, he believed that he could work with \u201csensible\u201d conservatives by embracing aspects of their policy as his own. Instead he found that his very imprimatur made that impossible. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that the GOP\u2019s primary goal was not to find common ground but to make Obama a \u201cone-term president.\u201d A health-care plan inspired by Romneycare was, when proposed by Obama, suddenly considered socialist and, not coincidentally, a form of reparations. The first black president found that he was personally toxic to the GOP base. An entire political party was organized around the explicit aim of negating one man. It was thought by Obama and some of his allies that this toxicity was the result of a relentless assault waged by Fox News and right-wing talk radio. Trump\u2019s genius was to see that it was something more, that it was a hunger for revanche so strong that a political novice and accused rapist could topple the leadership of one major party and throttle the heavily favored nominee of the other.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-24\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\u201cI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn\u2019t lose any voters,\u201d Trump bragged in January 2016. This statement should be met with only a modicum of skepticism. Trump has mocked the disabled, withstood multiple accusations of sexual violence (all of which he has denied), fired an FBI director, sent his minions to mislead the public about his motives, personally exposed those lies by boldly stating his aim to scuttle an investigation into his possible collusion with a foreign power, then bragged about that same obstruction to representatives of that same foreign power. It is utterly impossible to conjure a black facsimile of Donald Trump\u2014to imagine Obama, say, implicating an opponent\u2019s father in the assassination of an American president or comparing his physical endowment with that of another candidate and then successfully capturing the presidency. Trump, more than any other politician, understood the valence of the bloody heirloom and the great power in not being a nigger.<\/span><\/section>\n<section id=\"article-section-25\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">But the power is ultimately suicidal. Trump evinces this, too. In a recent <i>New Yorker <\/i>article, a former Russian military officer pointed out that interference in an election could succeed only where \u201cnecessary conditions\u201d and an \u201cexisting background\u201d were present. In America, that \u201cexisting background\u201d was a persistent racism, and the \u201cnecessary condition\u201d was a black president. The two related factors hobbled America\u2019s ability to safeguard its electoral system. As late as July 2016, a majority of Republican voters doubted that Barack Obama had been born in the United States, which is to say they did not view him as a legitimate president. Republican politicians acted accordingly, infamously denying his final Supreme Court nominee a hearing and then, fatefully, refusing to work with the administration to defend the country against the Russian attack. Before the election, Obama found no takers among Republicans for a bipartisan response, and Obama himself, underestimating Trump and thus underestimating the power of whiteness, believed the Republican nominee too objectionable to actually win. In this Obama was, tragically, wrong. And so the most powerful country in the world has handed over all its affairs\u2014the prosperity of its entire economy; the security of its 300 million citizens; the purity of its water, the viability of its air, the safety of its food; the future of its vast system of education; the soundness of its national highways, airways, and railways; the apocalyptic potential of its nuclear arsenal\u2014to a carnival barker who introduced the phrase <i>grab \u2019em by the pussy<\/i> into the national lexicon. It is as if the white tribe united in demonstration to say, \u201cIf a black man can be president, then any white man\u2014no matter how fallen\u2014can be president.\u201d And in that perverse way, the democratic dreams of Jefferson and Jackson were fulfilled.<\/span>The American tragedy now being wrought is larger than most imagine and will not end with Trump. In recent times, whiteness as an overt political tactic has been restrained by a kind of cordiality that held that its overt invocation would scare off \u201cmoderate\u201d whites. This has proved to be only half true at best. Trump\u2019s legacy will be exposing the patina of decency for what it is and revealing just how much a demagogue can get away with. It does not take much to imagine another politician, wiser in the ways of Washington and better schooled in the methodology of governance\u2014and now liberated from the pretense of antiracist civility\u2014doing a much more effective job than Trump.<\/p>\n<p>It has long been an axiom among certain black writers and thinkers that while whiteness endangers the bodies of black people in the immediate sense, the larger threat is to white people themselves, the shared country, and even the whole world. There is an impulse to blanch at this sort of grandiosity. When W. E. B. Du Bois claims that slavery was \u201csingularly disastrous for modern civilization\u201d or James Baldwin claims that whites \u201chave brought humanity to the edge of oblivion: because they think they are white,\u201d the instinct is to cry exaggeration. But there really is no other way to read the presidency of Donald Trump. The first white president in American history is also the most dangerous president\u2014and he is made more dangerous still by the fact that those charged with analyzing him cannot name his essential nature, because they too are implicated in it.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><small><em>This essay is drawn from Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s new book, <\/em>We Were Eight Years in Power<em>.<\/em><\/small><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>by Ta-Nehisi Coates &#8212; October 2017 Atlantic\u00a0 IT IS INSUFFICIENT TO STATE the obvious of Donald Trump: that he is a white man who would not be president were it not for this fact.
