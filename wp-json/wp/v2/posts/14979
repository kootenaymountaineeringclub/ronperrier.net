China swiftly crushed the disease and allowed its economy to return to near normal, even as much of the rest of the world struggled to cope. State media have crowed. \u201cThe advantages of the leadership system of the Chinese Communist Party and the shortcomings of the capitalist party system have been shown up in clear contrast,\u201d said an article by the party\u2019s discipline-enforcement agency. Many Chinese, though initially critical of officials\u2019 cover-up of the outbreak, seem to agree that the party has triumphed.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap\" data-caps=\"initial\">In the West, many wonder if China was partly responsible for the pandemic, by failing to respond sooner to early signs of a new coronavirus and by keeping news of it secret\u2014or even by allowing the virus to escape from a laboratory in Wuhan. China\u2019s censors tolerate no such speculation. State media report only on the party\u2019s resolute response, the results of which are clear. The country has had few cases for months and most of these were attributable to imported infections.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">China\u2019s efforts have involved not just mobilising the obvious people like medical staff, community health workers, scientists and police. It has also made extensive use of the party\u2019s network of branches to provide manpower and management expertise for a party-led operation on a scale rarely seen in the post-Mao era. In the early months village perimeters were guarded by temperature-checking volunteers in red armbands. They took their orders from members of village party committees who bustled about sporting party lapel-pins. In cities the party\u2019s myriad grids proved crucial in controlling people\u2019s movements.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Front-line responders who were not already party members have rushed to join: some 440,000 by late June last year. Yet less than 6% of these applicants had actually been admitted. For the party is highly selective when it comes to recruitment.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Indeed, it is one of the world\u2019s hardest ruling parties to join. And to keep out closet liberals and other undesirables, Xi Jinping is making it even more so. In other countries few mainstream parties would turn away anyone willing to pay their membership dues. In the Chinese Communist Party these can amount to as much as 2% of income for the wealthiest members. But party officials were wary of last year\u2019s flood of applications. They detected opportunism\u2014a chance to get an application fast-tracked by helping the party at a time of need. \u201cFishing in troubled waters\u201d, they called it. They warned party branches not to lower their guard. To qualify, officials insisted, applicants had to prove themselves in the toughest of covid-fighting roles, not to mention stand up to political scrutiny.<\/p>\n<div class=\"article__body-text-image\">\n<figure>\n<div data-slim=\"1\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/608\/792\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/2021\/06\/articles\/body\/20210626_src488.png\" sizes=\"300px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/200\/261\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/2021\/06\/articles\/body\/20210626_src488.png 200w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/300\/391\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/2021\/06\/articles\/body\/20210626_src488.png 300w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/400\/521\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/2021\/06\/articles\/body\/20210626_src488.png 400w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/600\/782\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/2021\/06\/articles\/body\/20210626_src488.png 600w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/640\/834\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/2021\/06\/articles\/body\/20210626_src488.png 640w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/800\/1042\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/2021\/06\/articles\/body\/20210626_src488.png 800w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/1000\/1303\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/2021\/06\/articles\/body\/20210626_src488.png 1000w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/1280\/1667\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/2021\/06\/articles\/body\/20210626_src488.png 1280w\" alt=\"\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Mr Xi began putting the brakes on recruitment soon after he took over in 2012. In the following year the numbers of new members fell to 2.4m, the lowest in a decade. In 2019, the most recent year for which data are available, it was closer to 2.3m. Chinese officials are fearful of the party gradually becoming a \u201cparty for everyone\u201d, as Nikita Khrushchev declared the Soviet Communist Party to be in 1961. Such deviancy, they say, was one reason why Soviet communism collapsed: it had lost its \u201cclass character\u201d. A scholar quoted by\u00a0<em>Beijing Youth News<\/em>, the organ of the capital\u2019s Communist Youth League, has said that China\u2019s party would be better with about 40m fewer members than today\u2019s 92m.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Not too many workers, please<\/h2>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Yet the professed importance of class background may be misleading. The party is still keenest of all to recruit the educated elite. In 2000 only about one-fifth of members had degrees\u2014about the same proportion as those who had not advanced beyond primary school. Now about half are graduates, helped by a big increase in university enrolment. Students make up about 30% of new entrants to the party. But many join largely for self-interested reasons. Membership is needed for good jobs in the civil service and state-owned industries, which offer greater security than private employment. So the party is raising the bar even for students. In 2019, 1.96m were party members, around 300,000 fewer than a decade earlier. They made up perhaps 5% of the total student body, down from nearly 8% in 2009.<\/p>\n<div id=\"\" class=\"advert incontent advert--inline\">\n<div>\n<div id=\"econ-2\" data-google-query-id=\"CKfcoqfVuvECFRLZWwodoUMNrg\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Given the hoops that have to be jumped through, it is striking how many still bother to apply: about 844,000 students managed to join the party in 2019. As well as the practical benefits, there is also the cachet. \u201cIt\u2019s like an Oxford dining club,\u201d says Peter Mattis of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (<\/span><small>aspi<\/small><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">). \u201cYou\u2019re in on the secret, if you\u2019re in. That is good for recruitment\u2014and for creating fear.\u201d It is also a badge of academic success: the party prefers students with the highest grades. In today\u2019s party good degrees count for a lot. While working as a provincial governor, Mr Xi managed to squeeze in a\u00a0<\/span><small>p<\/small><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">h<\/span><small>d<\/small><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">\u00a0in Marxism (though doubts abound about the quality of this credential). Kjeld Erik Brodsgaard, an expert on the party at Copenhagen Business School, says that the Central Committee is \u201cbetter educated than the Danish parliament\u201d.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Induction begins with an application letter that needs the endorsement of two party members. Next comes an interview with an official from the party branch. Then the branch considers whether to proceed. If it does, the applicant becomes a \u201cparty-entry activist\u201d. This phase can last a couple of years, during which the applicant must submit thought reports every three months, join political study sessions, do volunteer work and meet mentors from the branch who write evaluations. Then there are the background checks\u2014a process that involves investigating the political reliability of family and friends and examining school records. An applicant in the West for a government job involving official secrets would require less rigorous vetting.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">If all goes well, the applicant then has to swear an oath in front of the party flag, promising to guard party secrets, remain loyal and be \u201cready at all times to sacrifice my all for the party and the people\u201d. This means being willing to do as Mr Xi orders, without question. The party is his machine.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ds-layout-grid ds-layout-grid--edged layout-article-header\">\n<header class=\"article__header\">\n<h1><strong><span class=\"article__subheadline\" style=\"font-size: 18pt;\" data-test-id=\"Article Subheadline\">The Communist Party abroad<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n<span class=\"article__headline\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\" data-test-id=\"Article Headline\">As Chinese citizens head overseas, the party does likewise &#8211;\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">With China\u2019s global footprint expanding everywhere, so is the Communist Party\u2019s\u2014not always openly<\/span><\/h1>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"article__lead-image\" data-test-id=\"Lead Image\">\n<div><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"ds-layout-grid ds-layout-grid--edged layout-article-body\">\n<aside class=\"article__aside\">\n<div class=\"layout-article-meta\"><time class=\"article__dateline-datetime\" datetime=\"2021-06-23T11:50:26Z\">June 23rd 2021 ECONOMIST\u00a0<\/time><\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<p class=\"article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap\" data-caps=\"initial\"><span data-caps=\"initial\">\u201cP<\/span><small>arty-building<\/small>\u00a0has no borders.\u201d So intones the Communist Party to encourage Chinese firms to set up party branches abroad. \u201cNo matter where the project, that country will have a party organisation,\u201d is another slogan. China\u2019s rise has expanded the party\u2019s influence abroad. As Chinese citizens head overseas for work and study, its branches are spreading too.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Browbeating the West to show more respect is the task of party organs in Beijing. The foreign ministry does the grunt work, but the party\u2019s Foreign Affairs Commission, headed by Mr Xi, sets policy. The Publicity Department spreads propaganda through state media such as\u00a0<small>cgtn<\/small>, a television network, and Xinhua, a news agency. The United Front Work Department (<small>ufwd<\/small>) controls organisations seeking to boost the party\u2019s influence abroad, especially among ethnic Chinese. The\u00a0<small>aspi<\/small>\u00a0Australian think-tank says the\u00a0<small>ufwd<\/small>\u00a0oversees Confucius Institutes, the government-supported cultural centres on university campuses abroad.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Officials know the party is not an attractive brand in the West. So these organs keep the party\u2019s name out when operating abroad. At home, Mr Xi says China\u2019s state media \u201cmust be surnamed \u2018Party\u2019\u201d, to serve the party\u2019s interests. But\u00a0<small>cgtn<\/small>\u00a0broadcasts do not advertise the connection. The station sometimes employs anchors who are not Chinese, with backgrounds in Western media such as the\u00a0<small>bbc<\/small>\u00a0or\u00a0<small>cnn<\/small>. (America has designated\u00a0<small>cgtn<\/small>\u00a0and Xinhua as \u201cforeign agents\u201d; Britain has banned\u00a0<small>cgtn<\/small>\u2019s broadcasts.)<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Chinese ambassadors are also party secretaries, though they rarely advertise this. This gives them authority over party bosses in Chinese state-owned firms in their countries. They may meet locals as ambassadors, but put on the party hat for talks with Chinese expatriates. Chinese firms often hold party meetings in China\u2019s diplomatic missions, says Chen Yonglin, a diplomat who defected in 2005. And the party wants to develop more structures overseas. The aim seems to be to keep members engaged and ensure they are not seduced by Western political thinking. The party guards against ideological deviance, so its re-embrace of members when they return home is conditional on proof of loyalty.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Before the pandemic, 1.6m Chinese were studying abroad and 1.5m people worked overseas for Chinese multinationals. The share of students in the party was low: many would have gone abroad from school, at an age when few are members. But many graduate and exchange students join before leaving China. And membership is high in state-owned firms: more than 40% of the staff of centrally owned ones belong to the party. So there could be tens of thousands of members abroad.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">The party is still coy. In 2017 a newspaper revealed that Chinese firms overseas were guided by a principle called the \u201cfive not-opens\u201d: they keep quiet about the existence of their company\u2019s party organisation as well as its activities, do not reveal their employees\u2019 roles in the party or even their links with it, and do not make public any party documents. But under Mr Xi, state-owned firms abroad have to set up party branches. They appear to be complying. \u201cAlong the belt and road, the party flag is flying,\u201d state media proclaim, referring to China\u2019s global infrastructure-building.<\/p>\n<div id=\"\" class=\"advert incontent  advert--inline\">\n<div>\n<div id=\"econ-2\" data-google-query-id=\"CJDi0I-fu_ECFVgA-QAdzxACcw\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce has also called for the establishment of party organisations in the overseas operations of private firms. Huawei, a tech giant that has alarmed Western countries because of fears that China may exploit its network equipment for spying, employs thousands of party members. The firm\u2019s policy is to set up party structures in its overseas businesses \u201caccording to local conditions\u201d.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">On foreign campuses, in deference to Western sensitivities, the party does not appear to be trying to create explicit branches among Chinese students and academics. But Chinese students are often eager to maintain party connections when abroad so as to restore ties when they return. One way to show political commitment is to organise meetings to study Mr Xi\u2019s speeches. Some students abroad have formed cells for this purpose. University websites and social media in China have reported this at Nottingham University in Britain, South Korea\u2019s Kyung Hee University and Missouri State University in America. In 2017 Chinese scholars formed a branch at the University of California, Davis, but soon dissolved it since American law requires those acting for a foreign political party to register with the government.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">If party members form explicit organisations on campuses, they may find their freedoms constrained by the need to report on each other. But China can monitor the behaviour abroad of members and non-members alike even without a party presence. The Chinese Students and Scholars Associations that have been set up with government backing on most campuses with lots of Chinese students have no explicit links with the party, but their leaders report to Chinese diplomatic missions.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">The party\u2019s most intimidating global arm is the Chinese security apparatus. Unlike the army, police and civilian intelligence agencies do not belong to the formal party structure. But they are at its beck and call. China\u2019s spies travel abroad to monitor troublesome dissidents. Wherever they are, they read citizens\u2019 messages on social media. Chinese abroad who speak against the party take a risk: family members in China may suffer. There is little need for a party presence to instil fear. The tried and tested methods used by authoritarians the world over serve the party well<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>PARTY MEMBERSHIP How to join the party &#8211;\u00a0Getting into the vanguard of the Chinese elite To well-educated Chinese, Communist Party membership is worth fighting for, even if it is not easy to attain June 23rd 2021 ECONOMIST\u00a0 The fight against &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2021\/06\/28\/communist-party\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-14979","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-uncategorized"],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p2Ncip-3TB","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/14979","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=14979"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/14979\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":14986,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/14979\/revisions\/14986"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=14979"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=14979"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=14979"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
