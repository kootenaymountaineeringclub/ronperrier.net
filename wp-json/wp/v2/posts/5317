Parts of this kingdom persisted until the 18th century, while a few others were under some rule by the Portuguese Empire since the 16th century. In the 19th century, it was colonized as Portuguese Guinea. Upon independence, declared in 1973 and recognised in 1974, the name of its capital, Bissau, was added to the country&#8217;s name to prevent confusion with Guinea (formerly French Guinea). Guinea-Bissau has a history of political instability since independence, and no elected president has successfully served a full five-year term.<br \/>\nOnly 14% of the population speaks Portuguese, established as the official language in the colonial period. Almost half the population (44%) speaks Crioulo, a Portuguese-based creole language, and the remainder speak a variety of native African languages. The main religions are African traditional religions and Islam; there is a Christian (mostly Roman Catholic) minority. The country&#8217;s per-capita gross domestic product is one of the lowest in the world.<br \/>\nGuinea-Bissau is a member of the United Nations, African Union, Economic Community of West African States, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the Latin Union, Community of Portuguese Language Countries, La Francophonie and the South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HISTORY<\/strong><br \/>\nGuinea-Bissau was once part of the kingdom of Gabu, part of the Mali Empire; parts of this kingdom persisted until the 18th century. Other parts of the territory in the current country were considered by the Portuguese as part of their empire. Portuguese Guinea was known as the Slave Coast, as it was a major area for the exportation of African slaves by Europeans to the western hemisphere.<br \/>\n<strong>Europeans.<\/strong> Early reports of Europeans reaching this area include those of the Venetian Alvise Cadamosto&#8217;s voyage of 1455, the 1479\u20131480 voyage by Flemish-French trader Eustache de la Fosse, and Diogo C\u00e3o. In the 1480s this Portuguese explorer reached the Congo River and the lands of Bakongo, setting up the foundations of modern Angola, some 4200 km down the African coast from Guinea-Bissau.<br \/>\nAlthough the rivers and coast of this area were among the first places colonized by the Portuguese, who set up trading posts in the 16th century, they did not explore the interior until the 19th century. The local African rulers in Guinea, some of whom prospered greatly from the slave trade, controlled the inland trade and did not allow the Europeans into the interior. They kept them in the fortified coastal settlements where the trading took place. African communities that fought back against slave traders also distrusted European adventurers and would-be settlers. The Portuguese in Guinea were largely restricted to the port of Bissau and Cacheu. A small number of European settlers established isolated farms along Bissau&#8217;s inland rivers.<br \/>\nFor a brief period in the 1790s, the British tried to establish a rival foothold on an offshore island, at Bolama. But by the 19th century the Portuguese were sufficiently secure in Bissau to regard the neighbouring coastline as their own special territory, also up north in part of present South Senegal.<br \/>\nAn armed rebellion beginning in 1956 by the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) under the leadership of Am\u00edlcar Cabral gradually consolidated its hold on then Portuguese Guinea. Unlike guerrilla movements in other Portuguese colonies, the PAIGC rapidly extended its military control over large portions of the territory, aided by the jungle-like terrain, it&#8217;s easily reached borderlines with neighbouring allies, and large quantities of arms from Cuba, China, the Soviet Union, and left-leaning African countries. Cuba also agreed to supply artillery experts, doctors, and technicians. The PAIGC even managed to acquire a significant anti-aircraft capability in order to defend itself against aerial attack. By 1973, the PAIGC was in control of many parts of Guinea, although the movement suffered a setback in January 1973 when Cabral was assassinated.<br \/>\n<strong>Independence<\/strong>. Independence was unilaterally declared on 24 September 1973. Recognition became universal following the 25 April 1974 socialist-inspired military coup in Portugal, which overthrew Lisbon&#8217;s Estado Novo regime. Guinea-Bissau is a republic. In the past, the government had been highly centralized. Multi-party governance was not established until mid-1991. The president is the head of state and the prime minister is the head of government. Since 1974, no president has successfully served a full five-year term.<br \/>\nAt the legislative level, a unicameral (National People&#8217;s Assembly) is made up of 100 members. They are popularly elected from multi-member constituencies to serve a four-year term. The judicial system is headed by a  Supreme Court, made up of nine justices appointed by the president; they serve at the pleasure of the president.<br \/>\nLu\u00eds Cabral, brother of Am\u00edlcar and co-founder of PAIGC, was appointed the first President of Guinea-Bissau. Following independence, the PAIGC killed thousands of local Guinean soldiers who had fought along with the Portuguese Army against guerrillas. Some escaped to settle in Portugal or other African nations. One of the massacres occurred in the town of Bissor\u00e3. In 1980 the PAIGC acknowledged in its newspaper N\u00f3 Pintcha that many Gueinean soldiers had been executed and buried in unmarked collective graves in the woods of Cumer\u00e1, Portogole, and Mansab\u00e1.<br \/>\nThe country was controlled by a revolutionary council until 1984. The first multi-party elections were held in 1994. An army uprising in May 1998 led to the Guinea-Bissau Civil War and the president&#8217;s ousting in June 1999. Elections were held again in 2000, and Kumba Ial\u00e1 was elected president.<br \/>\nIn September 2003, a military coup was conducted. The military arrested Ial\u00e1 on the charge of being &#8220;unable to solve the problems&#8221;. After being delayed several times, legislative elections were held in March 2004. A mutiny of military factions in October 2004 resulted in the death of the head of the armed forces and caused widespread unrest.<br \/>\n<strong>Vieira years<\/strong>. In June 2005, presidential elections were held for the first time since the coup that deposed Ial\u00e1. Ial\u00e1 returned as the candidate for the PRS, claiming to be the legitimate president of the country, but the election was won by former president Jo\u00e3o Bernardo Vieira, deposed in the 1999 coup. Foreign election monitors described the 2005 election overall as &#8220;calm and organized&#8221;.<br \/>\nThree years later, PAIGC won a strong parliamentary majority, with 67 of 100 seats, in the parliamentary election held in November 2008. In November 2008, President Vieira&#8217;s official residence was attacked by members of the armed forces, killing a guard but leaving the president unharmed.<br \/>\nOn 2 March 2009, however, Vieira was assassinated by a group of soldiers avenging the death of the head of joint chiefs of staff, General Batista Tagme Na Wai who was assassinated in an explosion in 2009. Military leaders in the country pledged to respect the constitutional order of succession. A nationwide election in June 2009 was won by Malam Bacai Sanh\u00e1.<br \/>\nSanha died from illness and 3 months later, on 12 April 2012, members of the country&#8217;s military staged a coup d&#8217;\u00e9tat and arrested the interim president and a leading presidential candidate. Former vice chief of staff, General Mamadu Ture Kuruma, assumed control of the country in the transitional period and started negotiations with opposition parties.<br \/>\n<strong>Foreign relations.<\/strong> Guinea-Bissau follows a nonaligned foreign policy and seeks friendly and cooperative relations with a wide variety of states and organizations.<br \/>\n<strong>Military.<\/strong> A 2008 estimate put the size of the Guinea-Bissau Armed Forces at around 4,000 personnel.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GEOGRAPHY<\/strong><br \/>\nGuinea-Bissau is bordered by Senegal to the north and Guinea to the south and east, with the Atlantic Ocean to its west. It lies mostly between latitudes 11\u00b0 and 13\u00b0N (a small area is south of 11\u00b0), and longitudes 13\u00b0 and 17\u00b0W.<br \/>\nAt 36,125 square kilometres (13,948 sq mi), the country is larger in size than Taiwan orBelgium. It lies at a low altitude; its highest point is 300 metres (984 ft). The terrain of is mostly low coastal plain with swamps of Guinean mangroves rising to Guinean forest-savanna mosaic in the east The Bijagos Archipelago lies off of the mainland.<br \/>\n<strong>Climate.<\/strong> Its monsoon-like rainy season between June and September\/Octiber alternates with periods of hot, dry harmattan winds blowing from the Sahara from December to April when there is drought. It\u2019s warm all year around and there is little temperature fluctuation; it averages 26.3 \u00b0C (79.3 \u00b0F). The average rainfall for Bissau is 2,024 millimetres (79.7 in) &#8211; all falls during the rainy season.<br \/>\n<strong>Environmental issues.<\/strong> Severe environmental issues include deforestation, mangrove destruction, soil erosion; overgrazing and overfishing. The natural savannah woodlands have been replaced by cashew plantations.<br \/>\nIn the Bijagos archipelago are rare saltwater hippos, turtles, dolphins, manatees and sharks. A number of areas are protected in the Bijagos Biospere Reserve. The rainforests of the SE are the most westerly home of the chimpanzees.  <\/p>\n<p><strong>ECONOMY<\/strong><br \/>\nGuinea-Bissau&#8217;s GDP per capita is one of the lowest in the world, and its Human Development Index is one of the lowest on earth. More than two-thirds of the population lives below the poverty line. The economy depends mainly on agriculture; fish, cashew nuts and ground nuts are its major exports.<br \/>\nA long period of political instability has resulted in depressed economic activity, deteriorating social conditions, and increased macroeconomic imbalances. It takes longer on average to register a new business in Guinea-Bissau (233 days or about 33 weeks) than in any other country in the world except Suriname.<br \/>\nGuinea-Bissau has started to show some economic advances after a pact of stability was signed by the main political parties of the country, leading to an IMF-backed structural reform program. The key challenges for the country in the period ahead are to achieve fiscal discipline, rebuild public administration, improve the economic climate for private investment, and promote economic diversification. After the country became independent from Portugal in 1974 due to the Portuguese Colonial War and the Carnation Revolution, the rapid exodus of the Portuguese civilian, military, and political authorities resulted in considerable damage to the country&#8217;s economic infrastructure, social order, and standard of living.<br \/>\nAfter several years of economic downturn and political instability, in 1997, Guinea-Bissau entered the CFA franc monetary system, bringing about some internal monetary stability.[39] The civil war that took place in 1998 and 1999, and a military coup in September 2003 again disrupted economic activity, leaving a substantial part of the economic and social infrastructure in ruins and intensifying the already widespread poverty. Following the parliamentary elections in March 2004 and presidential elections in July 2005, the country is trying to recover from the long period of instability, despite a still-fragile political situation.<br \/>\nBeginning around 2005, drug traffickers based in Latin America began to use Guinea-Bissau, along with several neighboring West African nations, as a transshipment point to Europe for cocaine.[40] The nation was described by a United Nations official as being at risk for becoming a &#8220;narco-state&#8221;. The government and the military have done little to stop drug trafficking, which increased after the 2012 coup d&#8217;\u00e9tat.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SOCIETY<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Demographics<\/strong><br \/>\nIn 2010 Guinea-Bissau&#8217;s population was 1,515,000 in 2010, compared to 518,000 in 1950. The proportion of the population below the age of 15 in 2010 was 41.3%, 55.4% were aged between 15 and 65 years of age, while 3.3% were aged 65 years or older.<br \/>\n<strong>Ethnic groups<\/strong>. The population of Guinea-Bissau is ethnically diverse and has many distinct languages, customs, and social structures. Bissau-Guineans can be divided into the following ethnic groups:<br \/>\nFula 28.5% and the Mandinka 14.7% speaking people, who comprise the largest portion of the population and are concentrated in the north and northeast;<br \/>\nBalanta 22.5% and Papel 9.1% people, who live in the southern coastal regions; Most ethnic tensions occur between the Balanta and the others.<br \/>\nManjaco 8.3% and Mancanha, who occupy the central and northern coastal areas.<br \/>\nMost of the remainder are mesti\u00e7os of mixed Portuguese and African descent, including a Cape Verdeanminority.<br \/>\nPortuguese natives comprise a very small percentage of Bissau-Guineans. After Guinea-Bissau gained independence, most of the Portuguese nationals left the country. The country has a tiny Chinesepopulation. These include traders and merchants of mixed Portuguese and Chinese ancestry from Macau, a former Asian Portuguese colony.<br \/>\n<strong>Languages<\/strong><br \/>\n<em>Portuguese<\/em>. 14% of the population speaks the official language Portuguese, the language of government and national communication during centuries of colonial rule.<br \/>\n<em>Kriol<\/em>. 44% speak Kriol, a Portuguese-based creole language, which is effectively a national language of communication among groups. The remainder speak a variety of native African languages unique to ethnicities including Balanta, Fula, Mandjak, Mandinka and Papel<br \/>\nMost Portuguese and Mesti\u00e7os speakers also have one of the African languages and Kriol as additional languages. French is also taught in schools because Guinea-Bissau is surrounded by French-speaking nations. Guinea-Bissau is a full member of the Francophonie.<br \/>\n<strong>Religion<\/strong>. Throughout the 20th century, most Bissau-Guineans practiced some form of Animism.<br \/>\n<em>Islam<\/em>. In the early 21st century, many have adopted Islam, which is now practiced by 50% of the country&#8217;s population &#8211; most are Sunni denomination with approximately 2% Ahmadiyya sect.<br \/>\n<em>Christian.<\/em> Approximately 10%. 40% continue to hold d<br \/>\n<em>Indigenous beliefs<\/em>. 40% but many practice syncretic forms of Islamic and Christian faiths, combining their practices with traditional African beliefs.<br \/>\n<strong>Health<\/strong>. The WHO estimates there are fewer than 5 physicians per 100,000 persons in the country, down from 12 per 100,000 in 2007. The prevalence of HIV-infection among the adult population is 1.8%. Only 20% of infected pregnant women  receive anti retroviral coverage to prevent transmission to newborns.<br \/>\nMalaria kills many residents; 9% of the population have reported infection, It causes three times as many deaths as AIDS. In 2008, fewer than half of children younger than five slept under anti-malaria nets or had access to anti-malarial drugs. The WHO&#8217;s estimate of life expectancy for a child born in 2008 was 49 years and 47 years for a boy.<br \/>\nDespite lowering rates in surrounding countries, cholera rates were reported in November 2012 to be on the rise, with 1,500 cases reported and nine deaths. A 2008 cholera epidemic in Guinea-Bissau affected 14,222 people and killed 225.<br \/>\nThe 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Guinea-Bissau was 1000. This compares with 804.3 in 2008 and 966 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births, was 195 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5&#8217;s mortality was 24. The number of midwives per 1,000 live births was 3; one out of eighteen pregnant women die as a result of pregnancy. According to a 2013 UNICEF report, 50% of women in Guinea-Bissau had undergone female genital mutilation. In 2010, Guinea-Bissau had the 7th highest maternal mortality rate in the world.<br \/>\n<strong>Education<\/strong>. Education is compulsory from the age of 7 to 13. The enrolment of boys is higher than that of girls. In 1998, the gross primary enrolment rate was 53.5%, with higher enrolment ratio for males (67.7%) compared to females (40%).<br \/>\nChild labor is very common. In 2011 the literacy rate was estimated at 55.3% (68.9% male, and 42.1% female).<br \/>\nGuinea-Bissau has several secondary schools (general as well as technical) and a number of universities, to which an institutionally autonomous Faculty of Law as well as a Faculty of Medicine have been added.<br \/>\nPost. Slow so better to mail from Senegal or The Gambia. <\/p>\n<p><strong>CULTURE<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Music<\/strong>. The music of Guinea-Bissau is usually associated with the polyrhythmic gumbe genre, the country&#8217;s primary musical export. However, civil unrest and other factors have combined over the years to keep gumbe, and other genres, out of mainstream audiences, even in generally syncretist African countries.<br \/>\nThe calabash is the primary musical instrument of Guinea-Bissau,[69] and is used in extremely swift and rhythmically complex dance music. Lyrics are almost always in Guinea-Bissau Creole, a Portuguese-based creole language, and are often humorous and topical, revolving around current events and controversies.<br \/>\nThe word <em>gumbe<\/em> is sometimes used generically, to refer to any music of the country, although it most specifically refers to a unique style that fuses about ten of the country&#8217;s folk music traditions.[71] Tina and tinga are other popular genres, while extent folk traditions include ceremonial music used in funerals, initiations and other rituals, as well as Balanta brosca and kussund\u00e9, Mandinga djambadon, and the kundere sound of the Bissagos Islands.<br \/>\n<strong>Food.<\/strong>  Rice is a staple in the diet of residents near the coast and millet a staple in the interior. Seafood is the highlight including shrimp, oysters and sea bream, best served sauteed with onion and lime. Fruits and vegetables are commonly eaten along with cereal grains. The Portuguese encouraged peanut production. Vigna subterranea (Bambara groundnut) and Macrotyloma geocarpum (Hausa groundnut) are also grown. Black-eyed peasare also part of the diet. Palm oil is harvested.<br \/>\nCommon dishes include soups and stews. Common ingredients include yams, sweet potato, cassava, onion, tomato and plantain. Spices, peppers and chilis are used in cooking, including Aframomum melegueta seeds (Guinea pepper). Costly meals contain beef, goat, chicken or pork. Meals are also made with palm oil and peanut sauces and diverse vegetables.<br \/>\nChaberu &#8211; national favourite of deep-fried fish served in a thick palm-oil sauce with rice.<br \/>\nGuineans also eat wild\/game meat (bushbuck, monkey, wild hogs, etc.) but these animals are considered to be in danger of extinction and so it is not recommended to support this.<br \/>\nGuineans are known for their warm heartedness and so you will always be asked to come have a bit with a group of people (it is common to eat from a large bowl)&#8230;&#8221;bin kume, no kume&#8221;<br \/>\nFruit available depends on the season, but mangos, papayas, oranges, grape fruits, bananas, cashews and peanuts are abundant. Also try the sour &#8220;fole&#8221; fruits and the baobab fruit juice (sumo de cabaceira). Imported fruit can be bought in &#8220;fera de prasa&#8221; in the centre of Bissau (apples, pears, pineapples, watermelons etc) but is more expensive than in Europe.<br \/>\nVegetables sold in the markets include lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, bell pepper, parsley, okra, potatoes, carrots, onions, garlic, chili, sweet potatoes.<br \/>\nStreet snacks are typically sandwiches with hardboiled egg, omelete, fish or beef &#8211; or donuts, cake or hardboiled eggs. Frozen juice in small plastic bags or glass water bottles is popular among locals.<br \/>\n<strong>Drink.<\/strong> Guinea-Bissau doesn&#8217;t have a legal drinking\/purchasing age. In Bissau and other towns, Portuguese beer and wine are popular, but the African take on the originally Brazilian Caipirinha is definitely worth a try.

Bubaque has the more interesting masks and costumes. <\/p>\n<p><strong>GET IN<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Air.<\/strong> Oswaldo Vieira Airport, located in Bissau is the only international airport in Guinea Bissau<br \/>\nTAP Air Portugal &#8211; Direct flights from Portugal with every Friday, returning the same day.<br \/>\nRoyal Air Maroc.

There are no trains in Guinea-Bissau<br \/>\n<strong>Car.<\/strong> Land Borders. <em>Ziguinchor &#8211; Bissau<\/em> border crossing &#8211; As of Feb 2016), it is strongly and specifically recommended by the French foreign ministry travelers advice to avoid using this and to use Pirada instead. From Ziguinchor, Senegal to Bissau it should take you 3-4 hours by sete-place (seven-seat Peugeot) or your own car, depending on the border bureaucracy and the ferry in S\u00e3o Vicente. Roads are in good conditions.<br \/>\nFrom Gambia (Serrekunda), count on 7-8 hours if everything goes smooth. If going by sept-place, you&#8217;ll have to switch in Ziguinchor. The only really bad road in the trip is in Gambia, just before the border to Senegal. Dakar-Bissau with public transport can be done in one day with a little luck, but you need to leave Dakar early and change vehicle in Ziguinchor.<br \/>\n<em>Pirada<\/em> (dirtroad from there to Gab\u00fa) to Senegal<br \/>\n<em>Buruntuma<\/em> to Guinea-Conakry (also via Gab\u00fa).<br \/>\n<strong>Boat.<\/strong> There is a sea route between Dakar and Bissau &#8211; the cheapest and most scenic way to reach Bissau on biweekly overnight ferry to Ziguinchor getting a visa here. Additionally there are boats to and between the Bijagos islands.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GET AROUND<\/strong><br \/>\nThe main roads between Bissau and Bafata, Gabu, Sao Domingos and Buba are tar and generally good. The rest are unpaved and in bad condition.<br \/>\n<strong>Minibuses<\/strong> called toca-toca provide transport within the city. There are also regular taxis.<br \/>\n<strong>Sept-places<\/strong>, (seven-seat Peugeot). Tansporte misto are far more common and much less comfortable large minibuses for inter-city travel. Prefer sept-place or at least try to get the front seats. It is also possible to rent taxis to other towns and cities.<br \/>\n<strong>Bus<\/strong>. The main bus-station &#8220;paragem&#8221; of Bissau is situated behind the BCEAO (Banco Central dos Estados de \u00c1frica Ocidental) on the Airport Road. Are you heading for Biombo or Prabis, you need to go to another bus-station in Estrada de Bor. There are no time-schedules; cars leave when they are full. As most locals travel in the early morning (c. 07.00), cars fill up quicker in the morning. It might be hard to get transport in late afternoon and evening.<br \/>\n<strong>Boat.<\/strong> To go to the islands, there&#8217;s a choice between cheap, but rather unsafe, canoes (pirogues) leaving from Porto Pidjiguiti or Porto de Bandim and for between the islands, and expensive modern boats owned by French fishing lodges on the Bijagos islands. Expresso dos Bijagos links Bissau to Ilha de Bubaque. Schedules depend on tides, so check in advance.<br \/>\n<strong>Bicycle.<\/strong> As Guinea-Bissau is very flat and there is virtually no traffic on the roads outside Bissau, it&#8217;s a good country for cycling. Bikes can be bought in the country, which will probably be Chinese made. As always, good value for money.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BUY<\/strong><br \/>\nBijagos people are famous for their mask making and sculpture.<br \/>\nThe largest market in the country is Bandim Market, which is on the main road going into town. You can buy many things there and the atmosphere is nice. Otherwise there are small vendors on most roads of the capital. In the villages (Tabankas) you will also find small vendors selling the necessities. In the main towns in the countryside there are larger markets called &#8220;Lumo&#8221;, which give farmers and merchants the possibility to sell\/trade their goods. Don&#8217;t forget that Guinea-Bissau is a poor country and as such the possibilities for shopping are smaller than in the Gambia or Senegal.<br \/>\nWhen shopping in Guinea-Bissau you have to keep in mind that locals quite rightly tend to consider foreigners as rich (especially white people). The first price you are asked to pay will always be much higher than the actual price of an item. Haggling is absolutely common and no item should be bought without haggling for a better price. Useful creole shopping phrases: Ke ku bu misti? (what do you want?) N&#8217;mistil (I want it) N&#8217;ka mistil (I don&#8217;t want it) Es i kanto (How much is this) Rapatil (Request to lower the prize)<\/p>\n<p><strong>ACCOMMODATION<\/strong><br \/>\nBissau has a range of accommodation to suit most budgets. Hotels in Bissau are generally overpriced &#8211; but some hotels were undergoing renovation, giving hope for more competition and lower prices.<br \/>\nIn most of the towns outside the capital, there are possibilities to find hotels or other rentable rooms. National electricity is severely limited, forcing hoteliers to rely on expensive generator power.<br \/>\nThere are also mainly French-run hotels on the Bijagos islands which are recommendable.<\/p>\n<p><strong>WORK<\/strong><br \/>\nThere are numerous NGO&#8217;s, missionaries and international organizations (UN, EU, WHO, UNICEF, The Global Fund) working in Guinea-Bissau.<br \/>\nBandim Health Project, M\u00e9dicos do Mundo, INDE &#8211; Intercoopera\u00e7\u00e3o e Desenvolvimento [http:\/\/www.chimbo.org\/, Agencia de Cooperacao de Timor-Leste em Guine-Bissau<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Why go?
