The canyon soon narrows and the walls steepen. Easy at first, the road disintegrates due to washouts, blowdowns and mud and rock slides. In 2023, one can only go\u00a0about 1 km to the first washout. Above, the trail was closed by BC Parks in 2022.<br \/>\nThe trail follows the creek for several kilometres &#8211; go as far as you wish to go. It is certainly worthwhile continuing for 4.8km to see the trail blasted out of the side walls and the many coloured creek boulders. At 5km, a large slide path is crossed &#8211; look for mountain goats so be quiet and move slowly. Just past the slide and a gravel bar is the sandy beach, an old picnic table and a sometimes campsite. The trail continues for another 4-5 km to the confluence of Fry and Carney creeks at 845m (2800&#8242;). This trail deviates from the creek as it ascends but is still interesting with good creek formations, steep granite walls and fish.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Past the Carney Creek junction, the road, abandoned long ago, follows Carney Creek north, ascends steeply NW out of the canyon, curves SW, crosses Kootenay Joe Pass and descends to Kootenay Lake just north of Johnson&#8217;s Landing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>KOOTENAY JOE FSR<br \/>\n<\/strong>The steep winding road switchbacks up the north side of Kootenay Joe Creek.\u00a0The road is rough, steep and narrow to drive, mostly used by ATV&#8217;s but determined owners of high clearance 4WD can get within a couple of kilometres of Kootenay Joe Pass.\u00a0The road is slated to be deactivated in July 2012.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>0.0<\/strong>.

It took us about 2\u00bd hours to go from about 4,000 feet in elevation to the pass at about 6,200 feet with the 30 to 45-pound packs we were carrying. The afternoon was spent exploring the whole ridge and viewing the snow-covered mountains around us.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Day 2 saw us breaking camp and leaving by 7:30 am. A long, but pleasant hike took us down to Carney Creek. From here the trail is overgrown with a lot of fallen trees to bushwhack around or crawl over or under. Reaching the sandy beach on Fry Creek just before the rock avalanche area was the morning goal and our great joy when we made it. Alternatives to this morning&#8217;s adventure, such as watching golf on T.V. or having a second cup of coffee on our deck did cross a few minds. A few almost refused to get up when it was time to proceed but realized a helicopter couldn&#8217;t land in this area. We were all back at the Fry Creek trailhead by about 4:30. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Refreshments and supper at the Woodbury Restaurant perked us up and with the grunting, sweating, and muttering, long forgotten, we congratulated ourselves for having accomplished such a grand adventure into the mountains.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Organizer Vicki Hart and hike recorder Ray Neumar.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This good trail up the spectacular Fry Creek Canyon is very popular with West Kootenay residents during the spring.
