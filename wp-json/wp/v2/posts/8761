I know exactly where Baldr is; I just can\u2019t get to it, and the outing of Sunday, August 9th, was to prove no exception. This 2799 m (9183\u2019) peak, part of the Purcells\u2019 Leaning Tower Group, is located 5.5 km. NE of the coveted Mt. Loki.\u00a0Baldr was first climbed by a Kootenay Mountaineering Club party in July 1972 (Knut Langballe, Sue Port, Sandy McElroy, and Peter Wood) and has seen few ascents since.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">On September 30, 1998, I tried day-tripping it as a solo venture from Nelson and reached Mt. Hodr (225-238, not a gazetted name), 1\/2 km. to its NW before the thought of a return in the dark turned me back. This time, I was able to round up another partner in foolhardiness, Sacha Kalabis (well, no, he didn\u2019t know what he was getting into), and we left Nelson at 5:45 to catch the first Balfour ferry at 6:30 am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">After a 45 min. drive north along the logging road north of Riondel, we turned right near the km. 13 sign and headed up the deactivated Powder Creek FSR. The usual story: 70 min. to drive 11.8 km. to the road\u2019s end at GR 209- 279, 5403\u2019. By now, it was 9:15, and I was reminding myself that we should have car-camped. I rationalized this decision by remembering the weather wasn\u2019t very good the day before. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Off we raced with very light packs, following the good trail to the aptly-named Mosquito Lake in 25 min. The trail continues up the north side of the drainage to Tamarack Lodge, the fly-in commercial ski touring hut. As our goal was to the southeast, we removed boots and forded Mosquito Lake at a low spot, rebooted, and thrashed through the extremely annoying sub-alpine landscape south of the lake\u2014folded ridges studded with alder and blow-down interlaced like pick-up sticks. I have made three trips through this (tells you something about my judgement or sanity) and still haven\u2019t found any decent access to the south-side peaks. Once through this rubbish, we headed up steep alder slopes (again! It was either that or nasty, slidey scree gullies) below u\/n 2709 m. Higher up, we ascended moraine, polished slabs of quartzite, and snow to gain the ridge west of u\/n 2709. At this point, we could see Baldr, some kilometres away and wreathed in cloud beyond the twin horns of Mt. Hodr. An incredulous look crossed Sacha\u2019s face as he asked, \u201cThat\u2019s where you want to go?\u201d Although Baldr is technically easy, the obstacles are getting off the SE side of u\/n 2709 and crossing what looked on the map like a barrier ridge on the west side of Hodr. We first tried a descending traverse along 2709\u2019s south face, but were stymied by cliff bands. This led to a re-ascent to the 2709-Hodr 16 ridge and descent into a grotty notch west of Hodr which I had passed through in \u201998 (220-244). Keeping that west ridge of Hodr in mind, we traversed and descended south, hoping to turn the barrier at about 7700\u2019. When we reached this ridge easily from the north, we found a multi-hundred-foot cliff band on the south side extending almost down to the spectacular rectangular lake at 7000\u2019 located 1 km. west of Baldr (GR 205-230). By now, it was 2:25 and we had been going 6 hrs. 10 min. Calculating that we might descend this band, that we could reach Baldr in an hour and a half, that the return would involve lots of up and down, and that it would be dark by 8:45, I counselled retreat. Faced with Sacha\u2019s disappointment (\u201cI don\u2019t like being turned back\u201d), I suggested we scramble Hodr\u2019s west ridge. This turned out to be composed of very solid granite blocks, a walkoff on the north and very exposed on the south.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Reaching the cairned summit at 3:30 (6 \u00bc hrs. up), I felt totally whipped. During our 30 min. stay, I put in a KMC summit tube with details of the first ascent and the two subsequent ones and tried to force down some lunch which tasted like cotton wool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">With Sacha leading the way, we began our return by descending the northwest ridge, passing over the definitely-lower northwest summit and several lesser eminences before descending a chaucy (read \u201crotten, loose, and dusty\u201d) gully to the left of the notch we had passed through earlier. Then we continued along the southeast ridge of u\/n 2709 to its summit (GPSed elevation) by 5:05, stopping only briefly before descending snow and rock of the north face to pick up the snow of our upper ascent route. We went down a bit to the west of our up route and staggered through the nasty bush once again. Here, Sacha took a header in the alder and earned a nice battle scare on his shin. When we finally reached the trail, I counselled Sacha that we should now really boot it. Since the summit of u\/n 2709, I had been thinking that we would have to hurry to make the last ferry at 10:20.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">By 8:25, we reached the truck (11-hour day; 3 \u00bc hour descent from Hodr), and at 10:10 we glided into the ferry parking lot. Perfect timing. A satisfying but frustrating trip since Baldr had eluded me once again.<br \/>\nKim Kratky<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In Search of Mt.
