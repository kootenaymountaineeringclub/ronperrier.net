Further complicating things, it\u2019s only legal to do the trek with a guided tour company.

The MacLehose Trail makes constant, grueling 1,000-plus-foot descents followed immediately by ascents along the fingers of ridgetops, making it more challenging than its mileage suggests.\u2028<br \/>\nThe trail is broken down into ten sections, starting at the stunning eastern beaches before climbing up into tropical mountains, where monkeys chatter from the branches\u2014watch out for cobras\u2014and winding past 3,140-foot Tai Mo Shan, the highest peak in the area. It usually takes five to six days to complete the trail, which has been made a bit easier since the days of the Gurkhas with stone steps and paths and first-come-first-serve free campgrounds. Occasional food vendors offer more comfort along the way.

The sacred pilgrimage path, known as the kora traverses 32 miles around the mountain. It draws crowds of pilgrims seeking its powerful good grace but is also a first-class Himalaya trek encompassing meditation sites at waterfalls, the sacred cave of Zuthal Puk, and 18,600-foot Dolma La Pass. After completing the kora, take a dip in nearby Lake Manasarovar. At 15,060 feet, it\u2019s one of the highest lakes on the planet.

Has very poor eyesight but highly sensitive nodules that sense the slightest changes in water pressure, picking up vibrations. Try around Maniwas, in Okayama prefecture with clean streams with the perfect habitat. Exceptionally slow metabolism so feeds infrequently. It secretes a milky substance that smells like a Japanese pepper when threatened. It is the only salamander species that practices external fertilization &#8211; the female lays 4-500 eggs that may be fertilized by several males. they eat insects, fish, mice and crabs.

For fewer people on the trail, try one of the less traveled paths to the summit, such as the Gotemba Trail, covering about ten miles and 4,723 vertical feet.\u2028<br \/>\n<em>The Trip:<\/em> A Japanese cultural tradition, climbing Mount Fuji, at 12,389-foot the highest point in Japan, is one of the most climbed mountains in the world, with over 300,000 hikers trying to summit each year. And it\u2019s quite easy to access since its four major trailheads can all be reached via public transport from downtown Tokyo.<br \/>\nWilderness experience? Certainly not. But it is a once-in-a-lifetime cultural trip. It\u2019s the crowds themselves (a third of which are foreigners) that make Fuji such a memorable climbing experience. Watch the sunrise from the summit with over a thousand new friends.<br \/>\n<em>When to Go:<\/em> The official season is July through August. The crowds are smaller in June and September, but the huts may be closed and public transport slows down. In the winter, Fuji requires technical mountaineering and snow safety gear.<br \/>\n2. <strong>Temples of Kyoto<\/strong><br \/>\nSeveral walks around Kyoto visit all the temples and parks.

The in-house theatre shows a short film, made especially for the museum, that can\u2019t be seen anywhere else. With the crowds to prove it. Buy tickets well in advance as it is always busy.

There is a room displaying 3000 packets of instant ramen, so yes, there are more noodles than you can poke a chopstick at, but there\u2019s more. The museum celebrates the life of the father of ramen, Momofuku Ando, and includes a replica of the shed in which Momofuku invented the first chicken ramen. There\u2019s an animated movie detailing the history of ramen, an indoor cup noodle park where kids can interact with the ramen manufacturing process from the perspective of the noodle (really!), a factory where visitors can create their own totally original cup noodle package \u2013 from cup design to noodle ingredients \u2013 and last but not least, a noodles bazaar where you can sample the famous goods.<\/p>\n<p><strong>KAZAKHSTAN<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Unesco:<\/strong> 1.

Then climb over 3184m <strong>Ala-Bel Pass<\/strong> again with nice rugged mountains and great views. The descent is into a beautiful valley that\u2019s part of the <strong>Chychkan State Zoological Reserve<\/strong>. The route is now in the headwaters of the gorgeous <strong>Naryn River<\/strong>, which has at least 4 dams on it creating several reservoirs that we passed. The road loops around the vast <strong>Toktogul Reservoir<\/strong> before reaching Kara-Kol, where the first 210m high dam is (invisible from the road). The river is a fantastic turquoise\/green showing its glacial source. The gorge of the Naryn has sheer eroded walls and towering pillars of red sandstone. The country flattens but passes several towns, dry grassy hills, and fields of maize and stacked hay, horses, cows, sheep and donkeys. <strong>Arsianbob<\/strong> is a worthwhile detour &#8211; surrounded by an impressive wall of snow-sprinkled crags, the town is in a vast tract of woodland, the world\u2019s largest walnut grove. The grove\u2019s seed nuts were apparently a miraculous gift from the Prophet Mohammad to a modest gardener who he had charged with finding paradise on earth. Ozgon has a historic minaret and a three-in-one 12th century brick mausoleum complex. Finally, you reach Osh.<br \/>\n2. Osh to the Tajikistan border*. The 450km trip all the way to Murgab takes 9 hours going over several passes. Without your own vehicle, a private 4WD costs about US$200. Driving the Gulcha River and ascend to Taldyk Pass (3614m with rugged, craggy peaks flanking the road. After another 3550 pass, views were huge down to a wide east-west valley and the dazzling Pamir Alay Mountain Range on the Kyrgyzstan\/Tajikistan border. Descend to Saray Tash.<br \/>\na tiny village sits on a major crossroads: west to the tongue of Kyrgyzstan that juts into Uzbekistan, 74kms east to Irkeshtam on the Chinese border and Kashgar beyond and south to the Pamirs and Tajikistan. Drive 25kms west to Sary-Mogol and views of 7134m <strong>Peak Lenin<\/strong> astride the border, the cheapest and easiest 7,000m peak to climb in the world. The mountain holds the sad record for the world\u2019s worst mountaineering disaster, when in 1991, an earthquake-triggered avalanche obliterated Camp II on the approach killing 43 climbers. Return to Sary Tash and turn south. The potholed pavement degenerated to gravel before Bordobo at the Kyrgyz border post at the base of the mountains. To continue requires a Tajikistan visa and GBAO permit. It is then 20km further on a single lane dirt track to 4282m Kyzyl-Art Pass and the true border. A great statue of a Marco Polo sheep with huge curved horns is at the pass. Just beyond is the Tajikistan border post.  <\/p>\n<p><strong>KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE&#8217;S REPUBLIC OF<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Unesco:<\/strong> 1.

After landing in Lukla the route passes through the heart of the Khumbu region and wanders into Namche Bazaar at 11,286 feet and where most trekkers spend a few days getting acclimatized. From here, the trek heads up past smaller villages, like at 13,074-foot Pangboche, with its famed Buddhist monastery, before topping out at 17,650 feet at base camp, with the summit towering over 11,000 feet above.\u2028 You see three of the highest peaks on Earth (Everest, Lhotse, and Lhotse Sar) in one glance\u2014and dozens more Himalayan giants along the way. A favorite is the view from Thyangboche, called by renowned mountain explorer W.H. Tillman the \u201cgreatest view in the world.\u201d But it\u2019s the deep immersion in the Sherpas\u2019 Buddhist culture that will bring you back for the friendly villages, the monasteries, and the polyglot scene of world travelers who come for the high-octane pilgrimage to Everest. Go slow on the way up. Healthy hikers could cover 35 miles in two days, but the need to acclimatize means you\u2019ll take ten days on the trek in to Everest, but only three on the trek out.

Proto-urban site of Sarazm<br \/>\n<strong>Epic Road Trips<\/strong><br \/>\n1. Khorog to Danshube*. This is a 13-hour share taxi to Danshube. There is a northern route (goes over a 3252m pass and is closed from the end of October to May) and a southern route. And it is a wonderful drive following the Afghanistan border through a spectacular steep-walled canyon for 8 hours. The road is part asphalt, part bone-cruncher. Try to sit in the left hand middle seat for the best views across into Afghanistan. A narrow, raging river divides the Tajik road from a precarious foot-path-track on the Afghan side, linking hamlets of stone and adobe houses set among small fields surrounded by rock walls. The Afghan road is a marvel of construction with many blasted sections across rock walls and sections that exist only with the support of long sections of rock. Many were walking with the occasional motorcycle.<br \/>\nAt 65kms, the Bartang River is crossed. This valley is one of the wildest of the Western Pamirs with only occasional splashes of green amongst the barren rock walls. 4WD is required to get past Jizeu, a great short-hike destination.<br \/>\nThe valley widens at the mouth of the Vanj Valley that leads to the Fedchenko Glacier, one of the world\u2019s longest (a full day out-and-back hike from the end of the road). At Kalai-Khum, the northern route to Duchanbe takes off.<br \/>\nBetween Rogak and Khostov is the most appealing stretch of the road. Across from Yakhchi Hisor springs is an Afghan-side village with a series of houses perched on rocky riverside outcrops. After passing an Afghan border bridge, the valley opens up before turning west climbing to the modest 2200m Shurabad Pass. To see the best part of the trip, break it into two, or travel in the Khorog to Dushanbe direction. We ate at Kulob, Tajikistan\u2019s 3rd largest city. 30kms farther, at Vose is the startling 11th century reconstructed Hulbuk Fortress Palace (I didn\u2019t see this).<br \/>\nIt is possible to fly but why would you want to. The 45-minute flight is either the most exhilarating or terrifying experiences possible as the plane scoots between (not above) mountain valleys. In Soviet days, this was the only route on which Aeroflot paid its pilots danger money. Happily, the flights are grounded at the first signs of bad weather or unhappily, if there are insufficient passengers to fill the plane. Book an extra day or two in case flights are cancelled.<br \/>\n2. Tajikistan border to Murgab*. (Refer to the Kyrgyzstan section for first part of this trip from Osh to the border) At the 4655m Ak-Baital (White Horse) Pass is a large statue of a Marco Polo sheep with massive curved horns  This is supposedly the best place to see Marco Polo sheep from the road. At the pass, the snow virtually disappears with the road almost clear and a dusting on the mountains in Tajikistan. This was obviously in the rain shadow of the Pamir Alay Mountains, and foretold the desert to come.<br \/>\nAfter the Tajikistan border check-point, the road follows the Chinese border, marked with a fence topped with a meter of barbed wire. Enter a moonscape of hardscrabble mountains and rocky desert with the only plants tiny tufts of grass. Kara-Kul Lake appears below, the creation of a meteor impact some 10 million years ago. At 3914m, although salty, it is frozen till May, but there is a new jetty, plans for a regatta and attempts to declare it the world\u2019s highest navigable lake in the world, beating Lake Titicaca. Summer boat trips are planned to an island that was once a camp for unfortunate German POWs kept here many years beyond the end of WWII. Karakul is a small, scrappy village, 63km from the border and the only sign of habitation between there and Murgab. It sits on the lake and has 4 homestays. Osh bound vehicles often stop here for breakfast, but beware getting off here without your own vehicle, as getting out again might take a day or two.<br \/>\nThe whole area lies in Unesco listed <strong>Tajik National Park<\/strong>. Tickets aren\u2019t needed if transiting or sleeping in Karakul. The landscapes are archetypical Pamir poster-material with long straight stretches of road disappearing into stark, colorful mineral moonscapes, ringed with white-topped mountains in crystal clear air.<br \/>\n3. The Wakhan Corridor*. This wide river valley forms the border of Tajikistan and Afghanistan. Tall mountains rim the valley with the dazzling Hindu Kush in the background and forming the Afghanistan\/Pakistan border. Khorog to Ishkashim. This 100km stretch starts with the river raging through a narrow canyon. The road on the Afghan side seems close enough to touch. Near Ishkashim, the river widens with pretty meadows and fields. Near the town of Anderob are ruby mines first recorded by Marco Polo in 1274. Ishkashim is the Wakhan\u2019s regional center and largest village. There is not much here other than a famous trans-border market held 3kms west on Saturdays, but it  has not operated for many months because of Taliban insurgencies in the area. A passport was required but no Afghan visa. It is still a border crossing point to a safe part of Afghanistan. Ishkashim to Langar. This part of the road has the Wakhan\u2019s greatest appeal. Poplars, many villages and arid valleys frame white pinnacles and glaciers across the river on the Afghan side. Kakh-kara Fortress<\/em>, 15km east of Ishkashim, has a series of mud-brick wall fragments on top of a hillock beside the road. The oldest sections date to the 3rd century BC, but the site has been reused by many cultures since. It was built to defend parts of the Silk Road that went through the Wakhan Corridor. Gravel pathways make exploration easy. Visit the Bibi Fatima Hotsprings (named after the Prophet Mohammed\u2019s daughter). Bring a towel but no bathing suit is necessary in the sex-segregated pools. Stay at one of the nearby guesthouse high above the wide valley with the braided, meandering river far below. The houses are lovely: low, flat-roofed affairs with white plastered exterior walls \u2013 very similar to the adobe of New Mexico without protruding roof beams. The insides are glorious: colourful patterned rugs on the walls and floor and sleeping platforms encircling the room. A central skylight framed by massive beams in a pentagonal pattern makes them bright spaces. The rest of the ceiling is open beamed timbers with thin debarked branches filling the spaces. Towards the hot springs, see Vamchun Fortress perched on an impossible rock outcrop. Occupied between the 3rd and 1st centuries BC, many of the walls remain. One rounded tower has many ports. It is hard to understand the need to build something this high and remote \u2013 the valley below must have been a dangerous place to live. The river is a lovely turquoise. Some of the valleys coming out of the Hindu Kush have trees, fields and a few houses. Otherwise the Afghanistan side is desolately uninhabited. Continuing up the Wakhan, the road turns to hard packed gravel and bits of pavement in villages. Amazingly, Afghanistan is only the valley on the other side of the river and a narrow sliver of the Hindu Kush, with the majority of the mountains in Pakistan. The road is lined with rock walls, tiny collections of houses, wandering men, sheep, goats, cattle and donkeys. Langar is where the Pamir and Wakhan river valleys meet. The Wakhan is huge and wide extending due east next to Pakistan. There is not much in the town other than a collection of (supposedly) 6000 petroglyphs high above the town. Hire a guide to show you the way. It is a steep 20-minute climb past a Muslim cemetery (most gravestones have pictures of the occupant) to a large area of sloping granite. I found them quite disappointing as 90% of the \u2018petroglyphs\u2019 are recent and simply people\u2019s names. The rest are older (our guide did not their age) and almost all of these are poorly executed Marco Polo sheep. The few that are not were of a figure with a shield and headdress, some multistory Islamic buildings and a very nice sheep next to some good handprints at the very top of the rock. Langar to the Pamir Highway. At Langar, the single lane gravel\/dirt road climbs high above the Pamir River (now the border between Afghanistan and Tajikistan). Set in a steep walled gorge, only one glimpse of the river itself is possible. A well-constructed path is across the valley and we saw a caravan of 9 camels and 5 horses stopping at 2 mud huts. A little further were 3 men on horses. It is not obvious where these guys are all headed as the country is so desolate. Eventually the road follows right next to the river and we were only 30m from Afghanistan. Even though you do not actually set foot in Afghanistan, it feels like you have been there most of the trip. The valley eventually widens and the high mountains become rounded hills as you approach the military checkpoint at Khorgosh, 70kms from Langar. Here the road swings north away from the river and crosses 4344m Khorgosh Pass before descending to the Pamir Highway. <\/p>\n<p><strong>THAILAND<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Unesco:<\/strong> 1.

Starting in Chiang Mai and going clockwise, the circular drive takes in the beauty of Mae Hong Son Province passing through towns Mae Sariang, Mae Hong Son and backpacker mecca Pai.\u2028Scenery is as stunning as you\u2019d expect in Thailand\u2019s most mountainous province, and asphalt roads are in great condition. On the way you\u2019ll pass waterfalls, caves and temples, and climb Thailand\u2019s highest peak Doi Inthanon for spectacular views over the valleys.<br \/>\n<strong>MUSEUMS<\/strong><br \/>\n1. <strong>Erawan Museum<\/strong>. 99\/9 Moo 1, Bang Muang Mai, Samut Prakan. www.erawan-museum.com<br \/>\nThe museum is housed inside the five-storey, 250-tonne sculpture of a three-headed elephant. An enormous homage to Erawan, the revered Hindu elephant god. Thai sculptures of mythical dragons and fairies pepper the interior, there are ancient ceramics and gold statues towering over the ground floor, and all the exhibits are beautifully cast in the coloured light of the stunning stained-glass ceiling. It\u2019s certainly an eclectic and magical mix of artefacts. The collection is the heart\u2019s desire of eccentric Bangkok businessman, Lek Viriyabhun, who unfortunately passed away before the museum opened in 2004. To get the full effect of Lek\u2019s creative vision, clamber up the steep spiral staircase to get a close-up view of the multicoloured glass roof and a bird\u2019s-eye look at the exhibits below. When it\u2019s time for your psychedelic trip to end, head outside to take some deep breaths in the tropical flower gardens.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TURKMENISTAN<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Unesco:<\/strong> 1.
