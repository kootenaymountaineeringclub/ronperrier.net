This remarkable sandstone formation consists of undulating and contoured rock layers, giving the appearance of a frozen, swirling wave.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Multicoloured, eroded rock formations dominate most of southeast Utah, though particularly outstanding is the desert on either side of the Paria River, beneath the Vermilion Cliffs. It is seen along the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.americansouthwest.net\/utah\/grand_staircase_escalante\/cottonwood_canyon_road.html\">Cottonwood Canyon Road<\/a>\u00a0or at the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.americansouthwest.net\/utah\/paria_rimrocks\/index.html\">Paria Rimrocks<\/a>. All the formations are contained within the\u00a0Paria Canyon-Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness, of which the majority (the Arizona section) is also part of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.americansouthwest.net\/arizona\/vermilion_cliffs\/national_monument.html\">Vermilion Cliffs National Monument<\/a>. Here the land is much sandier and barren.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">All can be visited free of charge and with no access restrictions except the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.americansouthwest.net\/slot_canyons\/paria_river\/canyon.html\">Paria Canyon<\/a> system and Coyote Buttes, an eight-mile section spanning the UT\/AZ border. It was unknown before the mid-1990s but is popular because of just one formation, The Wave, a small ravine between eroded sandstone domes formed of amazingly beautiful rocks containing thin, swirling strata. Because the BLM considers the formations particularly delicate, Coyote Buttes is subject to fees, and entry limitations, with visitors having to apply in advance for daily permits.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Coyote Buttes was first publicized in Germany, in magazine articles and a movie (&#8216;Faszination Natur&#8217; by Gogol Lobmayr, 1995), and for the following few years was visited only by a few Europeans.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Coyote Buttes are the southern portion of the Coxcomb Ridge, a 40-mile-long escarpment that parallels much of Cottonwood Canyon Road and is crossed by US89 and ALT-US 89 south of the Vermillion Cliffs in Arizona.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The area is accessed on House Rock Valley Road (HRV Road). It is unpaved and minimally maintained. Most of the time, two-wheel-drive, high-clearance vehicles can drive the road. However, four-wheel-drive, high-clearance vehicles are necessary when the road is wet. During the rainy season and the winter, the road may become impassable for all vehicles, even those with four-wheel drive.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The BLM divides Coyote Buttes into two equal-sized sections, North and South.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Use topographical maps if possible. Buttes are marked with elevations that serve as waypoints.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>NORTH COYOTE BUTTES<br \/>\n<\/strong>The trailhead for the North section is 8.5 miles down HRV road, the same as the Wire Pass entrance to the Buckskin Gulch slot canyon.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">This contains the Wave and other famous sites and extends from Wire Pass about 4 miles south (2 miles in Utah and 2 miles in Arizona), while the southern half stretches a further 4 miles. The only other easily reached starting point for the North is The Notch, 2 miles from Wire Pass, where a trail climbs a pass in the cliffs and leads to the south end of the north section.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"p7sI2 PUxBg\" data-ved=\"0CBMQ5OoBahcKEwiYn_aRlM6NAxUAAAAAHQAAAAAQBA\"><a class=\"YsLeY\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aikenslodge.com%2Fthe-wave-southern-utah%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw2qO7NdHH1MoUPQC4fLAVS9&amp;ust=1748796323111000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;opi=89978449&amp;ved=0CBQQjRxqFwoTCJif9pGUzo0DFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-ved=\"0CBQQjRxqFwoTCJif9pGUzo0DFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE\" aria-label=\"Visit Aikens Lodge\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"sFlh5c FyHeAf iPVvYb\" src=\"https:\/\/www.aikenslodge.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/the-wave-utah4-1.jpg\" alt=\"The Wave at North Coyote Buttes in Paria Canyon - Aikens Lodge\" width=\"621\" height=\"414\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>The Wave.<\/strong> Coyote Buttes North is famous for \u201cThe Wave,\u201d one of the world\u2019s most iconic and sought-after geological formations. \u201cThe Wave\u201d is characterized by its undulating, swirling sandstone layers that resemble a frozen wave.

Later deposits buried the sands deep underground and compressed them into solid sandstone over millions of years. The covering layers have been eroded by wind and weather, exposing what is seen today. Dinosaur tracks have been found in the Jurassic sandstone.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Cross-bedded sediments<\/strong> form in granular sediments, especially sandstone deposited at an angle rather than horizontally, producing layers that are tilted or inclined. The series of layers forms on the lee side of a wind-formed dune. Winds blow sediment along the ground until it accumulates on the windward side. As it builds, some sediment falls over the end on the leeward side. Repeated avalanches will eventually form the sedimentary structure known as cross-bedding. The sediment is deposited at an angle to the base and top of the bed rather than deposited horizontally and deformed later. They can be curved or scoop-shaped or merge tangentially with the underlying beds.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The real colour depends on the time of the day and is saturated early, late and after rain. These are sandstones from Jurassic aeolian (wind-formed) processes that have become lithified. The colour is mostly from iron.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The layering is due to small-scale separation between layers of material of different sizes and densities. As more sediment piles on top, the weight causes the underlying sediment to cement together and form cross-beds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Sedimentary Deposition:<\/strong> Coyote Buttes are primarily composed of sedimentary rocks, with sandstone being the dominant rock type. These sedimentary rocks originated from the accumulation of sand, silt, and clay particles over an immense period. The sediments were deposited in ancient environments such as rivers, lakes, and deserts.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Lithification:<\/strong> Over millions of years, the layers of sediment became buried under additional layers of sediment. The tremendous pressure from the overlying material, coupled with the infiltration of mineral-rich groundwater, led to a process called lithification. Lithification involves the transformation of loose sediment into solid rock. In the case of Coyote Buttes, the primary lithified rock is sandstone.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Erosion and Weathering:<\/strong> Once the sedimentary rocks were formed, the landscape began to experience a variety of erosional forces, including wind, water, and ice. These natural elements started to shape and sculpt the rock layers, exposing the intricate patterns and unique formations. Erosion and weathering acted differently on the various types of sedimentary rock, creating a wide range of features, from the smooth, swirling contours of \u201cThe Wave\u201d to the jagged cliffs of the surrounding area.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Differential Erosion: One of the most important factors in creating the distinctive features of Coyote Buttes is differential erosion. This occurs because the sandstone layers are not uniformly hard; they have varying levels of resistance to erosion. Softer layers erode more quickly, while harder layers remain more resilient. This leads to the creation of fascinating formations such as the undulating shapes of The Wave and the slot canyons that permeate the region.<br \/>\nSeveral Areas of BB&amp;CR &#8211; Big Sink, Middle Reservoir, Twin Tank, Cowboy Hat (an odd structure),<br \/>\nPetroglyphs and cowboy signatures at Little Knoll (2-part panel on the north),<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Geological Uplift:<\/strong> The uplift of the Colorado Plateau, where Coyote Buttes is located, played a crucial role in exposing these sedimentary rocks to the forces of erosion. Over millions of years, tectonic forces lifted the region, causing the Colorado Plateau to rise. This uplift allowed the erosional processes to work on the rocks, gradually revealing the intricate layers and formations.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Colouring and Minerals:<\/strong> The vibrant colours seen in the sandstone of Coyote Buttes are a result of mineral deposits\u00a0within the rock layers.\u00a0Iron oxides (such as hematite\u00a0and\u00a0goethite) create red and orange hues, while other minerals contribute to the range of colours, including purples, pinks, and yellows.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In summary, the geological landscape of Coyote Buttes is the product of a fascinating interplay of geological processes over an immensely long period. The unique patterns, colours, and formations in the sandstone result from sediment deposition, lithification, erosion, differential erosion, geological uplift, and mineral content. This combination of factors has created one of the most visually stunning and geologically significant landscapes in the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In addition to The Wave, Coyote Buttes offers a range of other stunning rock formations, hiking opportunities, and photogenic spots &#8211; Coyote Buttes South, White Pocket, and Buckskin Gulch, each offering its unique geological wonders and natural beauty.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Coyote Buttes is situated in the Colorado Plateau, which spans across the states of Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico.
