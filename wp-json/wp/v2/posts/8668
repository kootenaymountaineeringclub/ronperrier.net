The highest and most interesting of these sedimentary peaks is Taurus Mt. Directly SE of this summit lies a lake at the snout of Whirlpool Glacier, the ulti\u00admate source of Forster Creek. As recently as 1952, this glacier featured an enormous spiral depression (hence the name), but the recession has eliminated this curious phenomenon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Immediately S and E of Bugaboo Pass rise the Quintet Peaks, five small though much-glaciated peaks. A point (8254, Campbell Station) on the most northerly, which forms the S buttress of the pass, was occupied by Wheeler and Kain as a survey station in 1910. Four of these peaks were\u00a0ascended without difficulty in 1946 by AAC parties from a fly camp below Bugaboo Pass. Along the S fork of Bugaboo Creek can be found remains of several cabins which date from the short-lived &#8220;Bugaboo gold rush&#8221; of 1906.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>ACCESS<\/strong> has most commonly been gained from the S fork of Bugaboo Creek, along which a passable road from Bugaboo Forks (Gmoser Lodge) extends almost to the pass. Taurus Mtn was reached in 1946 by crossing Phacelia Pass (7550), circling S and E to regain the watershed 2 mi W of the objective at an unnamed pass (7950, incorrectly labelled Phacelia Pass on 82K\/10), and finally dropping NE\u00a0<em>to\u00a0<\/em>the headwaters of Frances Creek, where a camp was placed at the N base of the moun\u00adtain. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">From Phacelia Pass, the 1952 party descended to the NE branch of Howser Creek and then ascended the E branch to the Taurus-Virgin col, placing a camp at 7800&#8242; a few hundred yards SE of the col. Both approaches require a day&#8217;s pack from the S fork of Bugaboo Creek.\u00a0 <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The N side of Taurus Mtn can also be reached from the end of the Frances Creek road bv packing to the head of the valley (about 4 mi). Campsites near Whirlpool Glacier are accessible from the end of the &#8216;Forster Creek road. The 1952 party reached a campsite here from one below Taurus-Virgin col by crossing the notch in the S ridge of Taurus Mt, Forster Pass being considered unfeasible (2 hr).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>QUINTET PEAKS<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A group of 5 peaks between Bugaboo and Phacelia Passes; numerically listed from NW to SE.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Map<\/strong>: 82K\/10E.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em><strong>PEAK 1<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0 2606m\u00a0 \u00a08550&#8242;<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u00bd mi SW of Wheeler&#8217;s Campbell Station (8254) along a wide rocky ridge; no record but likely ascended by ACC parties in 1946.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em><strong>PEAK 2<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0 2661m\u00a0 \u00a08730)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Immediately S of Bugaboo Pass.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">1. <strong>NW Ridge.<\/strong> From Bugaboo Pass, skirt first buttress to left until a talus-filled couloir gives access to the top of the NW ridge which is taken over steep but easy rock to the top.
