It is 550m long, a climb on good stone steps. The waterfall falls down a black granite face with white veining. There is no pool. I saw five gorgeous salamanders along the trail \u2013 a deep black, four with bright orange spots and one with bright yellow in a twisting strip along its back and spots.<br \/>\nUnfortunately, all the 14 or so garbage cans along the trail were overflowing with garbage strewn on the ground.

The entire city was closed down with all the museums closed (for security reasons!) and streets in the downtown core blocked off. 2,700 policemen from all over N Macedonia were here for security with groups every 25 metres. Helicopters circled the city. People came from as far as Croatia (a mostly Christian country) to see him.<br \/>\n<\/em><em>I found a parking place and tried to go down to the main square, the focal point of the visit. Security was extreme with complete bag searches and pat-downs. I was told I had to leave my umbrella at the checkpoint, returned to the van, got my computer electrical cord and rain jacket and returned to the square.<br \/>\n<\/em><em>The crowds were huge. To enter the main square area, tickets had been available until May 3 and were by location in the square. The singing started at 11 am and the pope arrived in his pope mobile at about noon. He gave his homily and later a speech all in Italian (nobody understood a word), guests spoke and he left the same way. It was all anti-climactic and more than a little boring.<br \/>\nWhen I drove out of town to go to Kokino at 6 pm (hours after he had left the country), there were still cops every 50m for 10 km from the centre. The whole thing must have cost millions, money that could have been better spent in this poor country. And for a church rooted in the 15<sup>th<\/sup> century with beliefs so outdated as to make it meaningless: homosexuality, divorce, birth control, condoms, celibacy of priests (the root cause of priests sodomizing millions of little boys and for which this pope has done nothing) and the corruption rife through the church. I believe that civil lawsuits should be undertaken wherever this church exists, their land and buildings taken away and they bankrupted.<br \/>\nI had a walk about seeing all the things that were open.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>SKOPJE<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Stobi,<\/strong> About 5kms west of Skopje, was a NM \u201cSight\u201d but I could not determine why, it looked like any N Macedonian city. There was an ancient synagogue from the 2<sup>nd<\/sup> century destroyed in the 5<sup>th<\/sup> century and a Christian church built on top here. It was also the site of the Roman town of Seripe.<br \/>\n<strong>Gradski Trgovski Center\u00a0<\/strong>(City Trade Center). This large two-level shopping mall in the centre of Skopje occupies at least 2 city blocks. It has all the usual stores and 2 apartment buildings in the middle.<br \/>\nThere are several great statues in and near the main square. A huge one to Alexander the Great is in the middle. A touching one with a mother stretching out for the hand of two children is near the mall.<br \/>\nMany restaurants with large covered outdoor seating line the west side of the river.<br \/>\nThere are 4 bridges in central Skopje, three of them pedestrian. I crossed the traffic bridge covered in bronze plaques.<br \/>\n<strong>Art Bridge.<\/strong> Built in 2012, this marble bridge is decorated with 36 bronze statues of Macedonian artists, writers, composers and actors. It cost 2.5 million euros, is 83m long and 9.2m wide increasing to 12m in the centre and has lovely ornate lamp posts.<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"http:\/\/flatiron.mk\/codeframe\/view\/page\/blog?post=8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwi7wp3Pz6LiAhUIr6QKHfY4BDgQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"http:\/\/flatiron.mk\/codeframe\/external\/media\/source\/art-bridge\/Art-bridge-in-Skopje.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Art Bridge skopje\" width=\"707\" height=\"398\" data-iml=\"1558098066941\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Mother Theresa Square.<\/strong> There are several plaques with her sayings: \u201cJesus said love one another, He didn\u2019t say love the whole world\u201d. \u201cSmile at one another, smile at your wife, smile at your husband, smile at your children, smile at each other, it doesn\u2019t matter who it is.

I read and listened to every display. 100 MKD<br \/>\n<strong>Old Bazaar.<\/strong> On the east side of the square is this series of pedestrianized lanes with many cafes and shops with clothes and jewelry.<br \/>\n<strong>Sveti Spas Church<\/strong>\u00a0(Church of the Ascension of Jesus, Church of the Holy Saviour). Built in the 14<sup>th<\/sup> century and destroyed by fire in 1689, the highlight is the masterful 1817-25 wood carved iconostasis. There is a museum to the revolutionary Gore Delchev in the basement.<br \/>\n<strong>Mustafa Pasha Mosque.<\/strong> Built of white limestone and marble, it has a 3-domed, 4-arched portico and is one huge dome inside with a grey mihrab and mimbar. Patterns of leaves decorate under the dome, around the windows and extend down the four corners. Free<br \/>\n<strong>Kale Fortress.<\/strong> Occupying the top of the hill, this has reconstructed bastion walls and 2 square towers but nothing can be entered and there is little to see. Free<\/p>\n<p><em>As I finished my day early, I decided to drive east and north of Skopje to see a few sights there. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Archaeo-astronomical Site Kokino<\/strong> (Kokino megalithic observatory). A tentative WHS: (30\/01\/2009), this has evidence of activity dating from the Early Bronze Age (21<sup>st<\/sup> \u2013 17<sup>th<\/sup> century), Middle Bronze Age (17<sup>th<\/sup> -14<sup>th<\/sup> centuries), late Bronze Age (14<sup>th<\/sup> -11<sup>th<\/sup> centuries) and the beginning of the Iron Age (11<sup>th<\/sup> -9<sup>th<\/sup> centuries) and is the only place in the world that served both as a religious sanctuary and an astronomical observatory. 70 km NE of Skopje, it is on Tatichev Komen Peak (1013m) above Kokino village. The people observed from four artificially carved platforms the solstices through cut marks in the rocks made at very precise locations. The moon, sun and star Aldebaran were all used in the calculations.<br \/>\nOn top of the rugged mountain are a ruined sanctuary wall and 4 platforms, one with carved seats. A sign said tickets are 2\u20ac for foreigners. I slept here and the temperature went down to 2\u00b0.<br \/>\n<strong>Kumanovo<\/strong>. In the NM \u201cEuropean Cities\u201d series, it is between Skopje and Kikono<br \/>\n<strong>Kratovo<\/strong>. In the NM \u201csmall towns\u201d series, it is southeast of Kikono.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Marko\u2019s Monastery.<\/strong> A real drive about to get here (71 km from Kokino), this small 2-story monastery has a stone\/brick church with frescoes painted on all the walls, arches and ceiling, great wood beams and an intricately carved cross on the iconostasis. 3 nuns were singing during mass. Free<\/p>\n<p><strong>VODNO MOUNTAIN <\/strong>(1,065m)<strong>. <\/strong>This is the big mountain that looms over Skopje to the west. The Mount Vodno Cable Car (100 Den return) accesses the high point of the mountain at Millennium Cross. It is a 5km drive up here and Google Maps gives no indication on how to get to the base of the cable car. It operates only from 10 am with the last car at 19:30 up and last down at 19:45 (April to September, slightly shorter the rest of the year). The lower access is at 570m and the upper station is at 1,065m.<br \/>\nI had come up the day before at 8 am but didn\u2019t want to wait around. So I returned and took the first car of the day.<br \/>\n<strong>Millennium Cross.<\/strong> At 66m, it is one of the highest crosses in the world, a symbol of the 2000-year history of Christianity. It is lit at night and can be seen from a huge distance. On top, there are several radio communication towers and a huge concrete tower is under construction. There is little to do but see the 360\u00b0 panorama. One sign points to the south naming mountains but is only in Cyrillic. Snow-covered mountains line the horizon to the west.

Free<br \/>\n<strong>Memorial House of Mother Teresa.<\/strong> Mother Theresa (1910-96) was born Gendje Bojodjiu in Skopje. In 1929 she arrived in India and came to Calcutta two years later where she developed several clinics for the poor (Home of the Dying, Leprosy centre and others). She was a very decorated woman courted at various times by many world leaders: Nobel Peace Prize 1979, British Order of Merit 1983, US Presidential Medal of Freedom, Beautified at the Vatican 2003 (St Peter\u2019s Square was completely packed) and in 2016, was declared a saint. The \u201chouse\u201d had several photos of her life including many from her childhood. On the top floor is a lovely glass-walled chapel with a skylight dome.
