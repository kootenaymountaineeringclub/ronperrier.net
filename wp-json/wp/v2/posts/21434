They had been sent to a monastery as a refuge from a civil war. Xuanzang decided to travel to India to learn more and proposed a visit. However, the emperor forbade him from going.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">That did not stop Xuanzang. He secretly set out on a journey that took him 17 years, heading through the Gobi Desert and eventually reaching India.

Eventually, he returned to China.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Xuanzang\u2019s translations and general knowledge acquired during the journey were a major influence on Chinese Buddhism. Likewise, he wrote a travel log that gave detailed accounts of countries in Central and South Asia.

In 1325, this Muslim Berber Moroccan scholar went on a\u00a0<em>hajj<\/em> to Mecca and didn\u2019t see Morocco again for twenty-four years. Over 30 years, he has visited most of the Muslim world, including Central Asia, Southeast Asia, India, China, and West Africa. His travels were more than any other explorer in distance, totalling around 117,000 km.<br \/>\nMarco Polo&#8217;s journeys were an estimated 15,000-20,000 miles in total. He was passed by a Chinese mariner, explorer and fleet admiral, Zheng He (1371-1435), who, across seven voyages, travelled 30,000 miles.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Shams al-Din Abu\u2019Abdallah Muhammad ibn\u2019Abdallah ibn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Lawati al-Tanji Ibn Battuta. Ibn Battuta was born in 1304 to a family of Islamic legal scholars in Tangier, Morocco. The path of his life seemed predictable: beyond his required holy pilgrimage (<i>hajj<\/i>) to Mecca, Ibn Battuta would follow the family vocation, undertake judicial training and find a comfortable, lucrative position somewhere working as a religious judge.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">It\u2019s worth considering the effect of Islam on travel at this time. Then as now, the <i>hajj<\/i> was required of all Muslims at least once in their lifetimes, and for those living on the outskirts of the Islamic world, this could be a journey of thousands of miles, taken without all the modern-day luxuries of cheap flights, plentiful accommodation and clockwork-like border control. For some, it was a journey they would spend most of their life saving up for \u2013 but it was a journey they\u00a0<i>had<\/i> to make, a mandatory \u201conce-in-a-lifetime adventure\u201d.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">He took his pilgrimage early at the age of 21. He then took an astonishing amount of time to come home, covering the territory of 44 modern-day countries and eating up around 75,000 miles en route, most of it by land. It took a further 29 years until 1354.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Coming from a relatively wealthy family, embarking on his first\u00a0<i>hajj<\/i> in June 1325 didn\u2019t seem to cause many difficulties. Following the African coastline west to Alexandria and Cairo, Ibn Battuta attempted to reach Mecca via a journey up the Nile valley, then east to the Red Sea and beyond \u2013 but had to turn back because of threats presented by a local rebellion on the route ahead. His alternate route via Damascus (the capital of Syria) and Medina (Saudi Arabia) got him to Mecca in late 1326, after over a year of travel.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">What followed isn\u2019t hard to decipher for someone who has been bitten by the travel bug. Using Mecca as a kind of spiritual base of operations (or an excuse to stop moving for a while), Ibn Battuta took journey after journey in every direction: south to the territory of modern-day Somalia and Tanzania and the Swahili coast, north to Anatolia (Turkey), and further and further east, across Central Asia and through northern India until he\u2019d found a way by land and sea to Beijing. By his fiftieth birthday, he\u2019d achieved the equivalent of circling the world three times\u2013over half a millennium before the first airplane took flight.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">In Ibn Battuta\u2019s case, we know about his journey because of a book he wrote. A book with a magnificent title that, like his full name, isn\u2019t destined for modern book covers (but perhaps should be): \u201c<i>A Gift To Those Who Contemplate The Wonders Of Cities And The Marvels Of Travelling<\/i>\u201d (1354). It was written in the form of a\u00a0<i>rihla<\/i>, a travel narrative, a popular form in the Arab world, partly because everyone would undertake one such great journey in their lifetimes.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">It\u2019s not Ibn Battuta himself penning the words in the book. Instead, it\u2019s written by Ibn Juzayy, a young writer hired by the Sultan of Morocco and tasked to sit with the great explorer and record his reminiscences, which appear to be without written prompts (there\u2019s no mention of Ibn Battuta keeping notebooks), of journeys taken decades in the past. Either Ibn Battuta had a photographic memory, or the blurry line between his recollections and the young writer\u2019s poetic embellishments and \u2018borrowings\u2019 from elsewhere was more numerous than would be comfortable to modern audiences.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Then there\u2019s the intention of the book itself. Perhaps this was something designed for posterity and future generations \u2013 but, likely, it was <i>also<\/i>\u00a0an attempt to show the Sultan (a potential sponsor for the explorer\u2019s future sedentary career) just how grandly Ibn Battuta had been treated on his travels, as a demonstration of how the Sultan should\u00a0<i>now<\/i>\u00a0treat the explorer. Exaggeration for career-enhancing purposes? It\u2019s certainly possible \u2013 and a\u00a0lively back-and-forth on the matter has developed around it.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">It\u2019s one hell of a story, though, and the Arab world is rightly proud of it. Today, the airport of Tangier is named after him, as is a crater on the Moon (a place Ibn Battuta might never have dreamt would be explorable).<\/span><\/p>\n<nav class=\"navigation post-navigation\" aria-label=\"Post navigation\">\n<div class=\"nav-links\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">7a.<strong> Zheng He<\/strong> (1371-1435).

What is known is that as a teenager and new mother, she assisted Capt. Meriwether Lewis and Lt. William Clark on their famous Lewis and Clark Expedition to explore the Louisiana Purchase and the Pacific Northwest. She is thought to be the first woman to travel the entire length of the Missouri River.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Sacagawea was a Shoshone Indian who was enslaved by the Hidatsa Indians when she was 12 years old. French Canadian fur trader Toussaint Charbonneau bought her from the Hidatsa to become one of his wives. Later, Charbonneau was hired by Lewis and Clark as an interpreter, and Sacagawea was tasked with coming along to help communicate with the Shoshone Indians.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">She was only about 17 years old and had given birth just a few months before she set out on the journey across thousands of wilderness miles. She helped during crucial moments on the expedition\u00a0 \u2013 finding edible plants, suggesting the best route to travel, and fostering conversation with some Shoshones, who happened to be led by Sacagawea\u2019s brother, Cameahwait. With their help, Lewis and Clark got horses and a guide to cross the Rocky Mountains. In return, Clark provided Sacagawea\u2019s son with an education.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">To this day, it is still debated when she died. Most historians suggest Sacagawea died young, at age 24.

However, she also travelled around the world in 72 days using trains, ships, and horses for transportation. Her inspiration was Jules Verne\u2019s book <em>Around the World in 80 Days<\/em>, and her goal was to beat the fictional character and complete the trip in less time.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Unbeknownst to Bly, she had competition from another real person.

He is the first person to reach the North Pole, but his travel partner, Robert Peary, originally got the credit. Later, it was realized that Henson was in the lead sled and was the one to plant the American flag.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In his youth, Henson\u2019s parents were regularly targeted by the Ku Klux Klan. Henson found inspiration from Frederick Douglass in his efforts to overcome oppression. When his parents died, Henson got a job on a ship where he learned seafaring skills.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Eventually, he met Peary, who was a U.S. Naval officer who hired Henson. They spent 18 years on expeditions together, exploring places ranging from the jungles of Nicaragua to the frozen landscape of the Arctic. It wasn\u2019t until Henson was 70 though that he received the acknowledgement he deserved for his accomplishments as an explorer. Towards the end of his life, both Presidents Truman and Eisenhower honoured Henson before he died.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">18.<strong> Jacques Cousteau<\/strong> (1910-1997)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Jacques Cousteau is perhaps the world\u2019s most famous ocean explorer.

He had a chance to travel by car from Hong Kong to Beijing because there was a Hong Kong-Beijing rally, and one of the famous Finnish race drivers, Ari, invited him to join as press. They took detours off the rally route to visit villages where the Chinese people had never seen foreigners before. At that time in Beijing, foreigners could travel only 20 kilometres from the city. The conditions in the countryside and the poverty in China were eye-opening. He\u2019s returned to China many times since then, and the economic growth is amazing, although the political situation is different.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In contrast, North Korea hasn\u2019t changed much except for more dangerous ballistic missiles and weapons. People suffer in the countryside, and there\u2019s no personal freedom. The advent of the Internet and mobile phones has made a big difference in material wealth. At the same time, the gap between rich and poor has been growing in every country.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Some destinations, especially those with people and stories, have deeply impacted him, like Afghanistan, where he\u2019s been 13 times.

He wrote the book \u201cOne People, One Planet\u201d and made a film of the Odyssey. He became Baha\u2019i, dedicated to the unity of the human race.

Dervla Murphy <\/strong>(1932-2022). On her tenth birthday, she got a second-hand bike and an atlas and thought she could bike to India. She started her long treks at 31 \u2013 4,500 miles from Ireland to Delhi (\u201cFull Tilt\u201d, her first and most famous book), 1,300 miles through the Andes and trips to southern Africa, Madagascar, Cuba, and the Middle East. Her copious diaries grew into 26 books.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">She preferred an Armstrong Cadet man\u2019s bike but used a mule in Ethiopia, or occasionally buses. She travelled alone. Why shouldn\u2019t a woman go where she pleased, embracing an unplanned life? She carried a .25 pistol in the pocket of her slacks and used it. Many who met her in the world\u2019s wilder places assumed that she was a man-she was tall, deep-voiced, well-muscled, and could drink like a man, beer being her staple, and preferred to do her research in bars, pubs, and teahouses or at village gatherings. Those were the people she wanted to mix with, ordinary folk. The major conclusion was that wherever you went in this fractious world, people were essentially the same and had to be treated with simple (socialist) fairness.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The more remote the place, the more she was drawn there. Afghanistan on a bike became her special love. She felt she might have stayed forever in the Hindu Kush, living in the sanity of backwardness. She disliked Western ways. Strong political feelings led her to live in squalid, disease-ridden camps among refugees from Tibet and Palestine, becoming a campaigner for them. She travelled among victims of Aids and genocide in Africa.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In old age and subsisting mostly on beer, her regrets were few. She wished she had visited Tibet before the Chinese took over, and wished that remote places might be allowed to stay that way. Mass tourism, motor roads, expanding markets, and capitalism itself were all near hell to her. Each mobile phone announced the end of a sealed and precious culture.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" nofocus\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https:\/\/th.bing.com\/th\/id\/R.61e19f4e122e01622c9b3a8aa0cd6253?rik=5v8Qi0xbxh5mJA&amp;riu=http%3a%2f%2fkerrycyclingcampaign.org%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2016%2f06%2fbooks-dervla2_3213469a-large.jpg&amp;ehk=KudU6omU3dYO9Wnr7siHipoLgAWFveaEujTrL%2fyi4HI%3d&amp;risl=&amp;pid=ImgRaw&amp;r=0\" alt=\"Who is Dervla Murphy ? | Kerry Cycling Campaign\" width=\"621\" height=\"387\" aria-label=\"Who is Dervla Murphy ? | Kerry Cycling Campaign\" data-bm=\"5\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>12.

She is the first person from Bangladesh to climb the so-called \u201cSeven Summits,\u201d \u2013 which are the seven highest mountains on the seven continents. She has also worked endlessly to raise awareness about animal rights, environmental issues, and women\u2019s rights.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Nazreen launched her summit bid to mark 40 years of progress in women\u2019s rights in the patriarchal society where she was raised. Her mountain climbs were particularly notable since girls have traditionally been discouraged from doing outdoor activities in Bangladesh. Plus, the country\u2019s terrain is pretty flat and often is flooded during typhoons.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Nazreen has said these natural disasters taught her to have an extreme respect for nature since it\u2019s the \u201creal boss.\u201d The floods also have fostered her ongoing desire to promote environmental responsibility.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Her inspirational life led her to be named the National Geographic Adventurer of the Year in 2014.

He used buses, taxis, trains, and longer-haul voyages, mostly by hitching lifts on cargo ships and his own two feet to travel 160,000 miles in exactly 1,426 days \u2013 all on a shoestring of just $100 a week. The epic journey began in his hometown of Liverpool on New Year\u2019s Day 2009 and ended in Juba, the capital of South Sudan, which did not even exist when he set off.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">North Korea, Iraq, and Afghanistan were the easy ones \u2013 far tougher were getting to tiny island nations like Nauru, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the Maldives, and the Seychelles, where there were sometimes pirate threats.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">\u201cI love to travel, and I guess my reason for doing it was I wanted to see if this could be done by one person travelling on a shoestring. I think I also wanted to show that the world is not some big, scary place, but in fact, is full of people who want to help you even if you are a stranger.\u201d He raised money for the charity WaterAid.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">This however, was a \u201cbroken up\u201d journey in the sense that he flew home a few times and then restarted his journey, in contradistinction to Torbj\u00f8rn Pedersen (see below) whose journey was unbroken.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>15. Torbj\u00f8rn Pedersen <\/strong>(aka Thor, he called the project \u2018Once Upon a Saga\u2019) finished his quest to visit 203 countries in May 2023 in an unbroken journey without flying. He spent at least 24 hours in each country, with an average time of 17 days. Although initially planned to take 4 years, this took him almost 10 years, due to unforeseen challenges such as visa issues, political unrest, and the COVID-19 pandemic. During the adventure, he got married and saw his goal slip beyond his grasp due to pandemic travel restrictions when he spent three years in Hong Kong.<br \/>\nHe had three cardinal rules: absolutely no flying, staying in each country for a minimum of 24 hours, and not returning home until visiting the final country. The three semi-mandatory sub-rules were not paying any bribes, sticking to a budget of roughly $20 a day, and never eating at McDonald&#8217;s.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Pedersen set off in October 2013 when the iPhone 5 was the latest model being marketed. He took more than 300 long-distance buses, over 200 trains, 40 container ships, shared motorcycle taxis, and a high-performance yacht, sometimes having to backtrack due to illness, visa delays, or conflict.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cI depleted my personal funds, sold some possessions, and took out two loans. A few years in, I found that what used to be 1% work and 99% fun had turned to 99% work.\u201d His three cardinal rules seemed innocent at first but created a mental prison for him as the years went on. \u201cFour years turned to five, then six, then seven, and then a global pandemic broke out when I was just missing nine more countries. I finally reached the last country and returned home after nearly a decade. You\u2019d have to be a certifiable nutcase to do a thing like that,\u201d Pedersen says. His now-wife came to visit him 27 times.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The most complicated was the Panama-Colombia border, Saudi Arabia would not accept overland travel and entering Equatorial Guinea required visiting 5-6 EG embassies, and the borders closed during Covid.

Paragliding relies on a hanging bell that rings when it touches the ground below him. When he skis he follows a guide who wears a speaker on his back to amplify directions.

For my first major trip, a friend and I stuck out our thumbs from Victoria in 1964 to go around the world. We had $30 between us. When we ran out of money, we worked at whatever we could get. That lasted about a year until I ran into a girl and got married, which put a damper on travel for too many years. I have a 1957 Rolls-Royce that I drove around the world in 2007, then from Victoria, Canada, to Alaska &amp; the Canadian Yukon in 2009, then through Central and South America and back in 2011. I&#8217;ve driven it through 49 countries and all the Canadian provinces and continental US states.
