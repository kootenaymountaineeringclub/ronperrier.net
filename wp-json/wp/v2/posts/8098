The names of those we know of are listed below. The routes are named after food common to some of the workers&#8217; nationalities.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As you noodle around Trail&#8217;s rock walls, we hope you delight in their extraordinary crafting, and pause to contemplate the intensive labour that went into hauling, shaping, and carefully placing each stone. Look closely at how the rocks were placed. You may spot &#8220;twin&#8221; rocks, the result of drilling. Perhaps you&#8217;ll hear the clank of a sledgehammer striking a chisel or the crack of a rock splitting.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As far as we know, our walls were constructed from the early 1900&#8217;s to the mid-60s. As you explore the routes, you&#8217;ll become familiar with the eras in which they were built.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Earlier years: (20s &#8211; early 40s)<\/strong> &#8211; dry-stacked, no mortar, small rocks, easily shaped and lifted by hand, mortared rock, simple detailing, many cracked and deteriorating, dry-stacked slate, or round rocks, either loosely laid or embedded in cement<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Middle years: (40s &#8211; early 50s)<\/strong> &#8211; dry-stacked, larger granite chunks, some drill holes, hand-hewn, moved with muscle, crowbars and an old bear paw crane<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Later years: (50s &#8211; 60s)<\/strong> &#8211; large boulders, more evidence of drilling; moved with muscle and crowbars, larger unit crane and shovel, private mortared walls with refined detailing, split river rock and mortared walls<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The builders are honoured with a listing: 15 stone masons, 3 relief camp workers, 8 smelter workers, 28 in the city crew, 19 in the parks gang, 11 equipment operators, and 5 quarrymen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Please buy the brochure for $2.

Take the eight cement steps to your left, and walk toward the Trail Labour Centre&#8217;s rock walls: granite, river rock, some split, some roughly embedded in cement. A bronze plaque on the entrance wall honours the builders. Along Portland St., head up the alley for a wall erected with enormous granite chunks. Back to Portland; turn right.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Cross Bay Ave., amble past Jubilee Place, left on Groutage Ave. and left at the fire hydrant. A gorgeous split rock wall leads you to the stone planters along Jubilee Park. Linger at the large crescent-shaped stone planter overlooking the river. Backtrack to the fire hydrant, pussyfoot left to the path along the river (or head along Groutage Ave.) leading to the Columbia River Skywalk and the Rotary Park gazebo. Continue to the site of the &#8220;Old Trail Bridge&#8221; and peruse the mountainside for remnants of old rock walls.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Rock and roll up those stairs, pausing to take in the river views.

At the intersection of Fourth and McQuarrie is a striking curved stone wall to admire.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Cross McQuarrie to see the sturdy walls that are to your left and below you. Now walk along Fourth, down the hill. Several retaining walls can be seen behind one of the houses to your left. Head to Robertson St., where, if you look left up the hill, you can see a concrete block wall which used to be of stone construction. Follow Robertson to your right and you&#8217;ll stroll past a small fence built into a mini-river rock-and-mortar foundation. Go left on Fifth to the dead-end. A low deteriorating rock and mortar wall with a flat cement cap is on either side of the tunnel. Now, backtrack on Fifth to Circle St. to view the small house on the left corner, built on a rock foundation. Stroll along Circle St. where stone pillars and an attractive stone-covered entrance are visible at two different homes near the end. Once back on Fifth, head left and you&#8217;re almost back at Marino&#8217;s, where you can pick up the rock candy you ordered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">10. <strong>Canneloni\u00a0<\/strong> \u00a02.8 km\u00a0 \u00a0 Easy<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Begin by admiring the stone crafting right in the <strong>Gyro Park <\/strong>parking lot: huge boulders of varied shapes and sizes at both ends of the lot. Its craftsmen are honoured on the bronze plaque. Cross to Gyro Park and walk toward the river past the stone columns of the concession stand. Follow the sidewalk past the wide stairs to view Gyro&#8217;s bronze plaque. Head down the next staircase to see the &#8220;bleachers&#8217;: a multi-tiered stone\/mortar retaining wall. You can walk on one of the ledges to the end and climb down to the path leading to the next flight of stairs. Ascend the stairs, walk left, and note the various rock walls on our right.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">At the far end of the park at Hazelwood Dr., go left a ways up the little hill. Look toward a pretty view of Trail over Bingy Bay and note the large rock wall supporting the sidewalk you just walked on. At this point you could walk the loop up and around Sunningdale (Hazelwood, Marianna, Hillside, and back to Bingy Bay) and view the private rockwork en route. This loop adds 2.2 km to the route. Heading back to Gyro, you can take the sidewalk all the way, or descend a stairway and explore the riverside.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When you reach the wide stone staircase leading to the beach, examine the tidy rockwork both on these stairs and on the sidewalk&#8217;s old retaining walls. Canter around the park to your right, to the unnamed road along the river. Half a block down, a house completely built of stone with lovely decorative windows and a sturdy stone chimney will catch your eye. Round the block to view the front, but please respect the owner&#8217;s privacy. You are now on Columbia Avenue.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Backtrack on Columbia and turn left on Goepel. Cross Second Ave. and turn left onto Third Ave. Lane where a few older rock walls greet you. Halfway down is an interesting &#8220;character&#8221; wall, constructed mostly of river rock and odd stones. Toward the end of the block notice the bi-level, large stone wall and stairway made of mortared granite and river rock. Cross Taylor St. and continue along the Lane. View the stone stairs leading up to the corner house and notice the rock walls all along this dirt road. The Lane&#8217;s retaining wall is still below you and visible by looking over the edge. Tidy detailing around the rocks in the last yard and a little set of stone stairs are evident. Keep moving along and a little road leads you back to the Gyro parking lot&#8230; maybe the concession is open.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Rock Wall Project Entusuastico Society<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">www.3.telus.net\/therockwallproject<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">therockwallproject@telus.net<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>TRAIL\u2019S ROCK WALLS \u2013 A Walking Tour Adventure These walking tours were conceived and produced with great reverence for the many men who had a hand in these walls.
