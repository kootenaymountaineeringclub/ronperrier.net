Your <strong>vehicle insurance<\/strong> may not be valid in Kosovo. Mine wasn\u2019t and insurance needs to be purchased at the border.<br \/>\n2. <strong>Google Maps<\/strong> doesn\u2019t work well here. After you start Directions, there is no Start button, only Preview. The route is marked but there is no navigation and it requires refreshing every minute. There is no rerouting so making a mistake and missing a turn requires using unmarked routes to get to the marked one.<br \/>\n3.<strong> Currency:<\/strong>\u00a0Euro<\/p>\n<p><strong>OBSERVATIONS for KOSOVO<\/strong><br \/>\n1. Traffic seems to move very slowly \u2013 large trucks, buses, tractors (many), the many very slow Kosovo local drivers and horses or oxen pulling carts all keep the pace around some of the towns to about 50kms\/hour.<br \/>\n2. There is a lot of farm traffic: many horses and even a pair of oxen were seen usually manned by an old guy with his wife on the back and pulling ancient wood carts. Tractors and odd machines that looked like rototillers with bicycle-like handlebars were everywhere. There is an odd golf cart-like contraption with a loud engine.<br \/>\n3. Kosovo people seem unusually friendly and nice. I had many chance encounters.\u00a0Even though this is an almost entirely Muslim country, I did not see one head scarf or burka.<\/p>\n<p><em>I crossed into Kosovo at about 5 pm. Again my car insurance was not valid here and it was necessary to purchase 15 days of insurance for <\/em><em>\u20ac15. I also got the agent to take all the N Macedonian money I had as I never planned on returning there in the future.<br \/>\n<\/em><em>Google Maps turned weird after entering Kosovo. Normally after you choose your destination, a small icon for Directions appears, then one for Start. Instead, it was Preview \u2013 only a route that disappeared was possible with no turn-by-turn navigation. This is the first time this has happened in my almost 16 months<\/em>\u00a0<em>of completely relying on Google Maps, fine if staying on one road but much more difficult if there are any turns or you get off route as there is no re-routing. I downloaded Maps Me offline maps to use in Kosovo, but the same problem occurred (Maps Me doesn\u2019t have Preview so there was no route at all). Kosovo is a real outlier (one of the four independent countries in the world that don\u2019t belong to the United Nations) and possibly Google Maps are not registered here. I searched the problem and the latter is the explanation.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Immediately across the border, Kosovo is building a huge expressway to North Macedonia, much of it elevated on big overpasses. It must have been very expensive to build. Supposedly it was to be finished in 2018, it looked like it would be open very soon. I turned west to go through the Sar Mountains on the Macedonian\/Kosovo border. The mountains were covered with more snow than I have seen so far. I got water from a stream. The road topped out at a pass with a resort village, then descended to Prizren. Besides all the horses pulling wagons, an old woman was herding a single cow through one town. Just before the town, it passes through a lovely narrow gorge.<\/p>\n<p><strong>PRIZREN <\/strong>(pop 86,000)<br \/>\nPrizren is a historic city located on the banks of the Prizren Bistrica River and the slopes of the \u0160ar Mountains. The municipality has a border with Albania and North Macedonia.<sup>[<\/sup>By road the city is 99 kilometres (62 miles) northwest of\u00a0Skopje, 85 kilometres (53 miles) south of\u00a0Pristina\u00a0and 175 kilometres (109 miles) northeast of\u00a0Tirana.<br \/>\n<strong>History.<\/strong> It was the Roman town of Theranda. Bulgarian rulers controlled the Prizren area from the 850s, Slav migrants arrived in the area in the 11<sup>th<\/sup> century and the Byzantines took over in the early 11<sup>th<\/sup> century. Serbians arrived retaking the area in 1180-90 and again in 1208. The Ottomans conquered it in 1455 and it was a prosperous trade city and the cultural and intellectual centre of Ottoman Kosovo. It was dominated by its Muslim population, who composed over 70% of its population in 1857. The city became the biggest Albanian cultural centre and the coordinated political and cultural capital of the Kosovar Albanians. During the late 19th century the city became a focal point for Albanian nationalism and saw the creation in 1878 of the League of Prizren, a movement formed to seek the national unification and liberation of Albanians within the Ottoman Empire.<br \/>\nit was involved in the First Balkan War in 1912 and the Serbs killed 5,000 Albanians in an attempt to destroy the Islamic population. Most foreigners were barred from entering the city (but Leon Trotsky arrived and worked for a Ukranian newspaper there). 30,000 fled to Bosnia. 30 of the 32 mosques were turned into hay barns and military quarters.<br \/>\nIn WWI, Bulgarians took over with forced Bulgarisation and 1,000 people died of hunger in 1917. By the end of 1918, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was formed. In WW II, the Italians controlled the area. In 1944, German forces were driven out of Kosovo by a combined Russian-Bulgarian force, and then the Communist government of Yugoslavia took control.<br \/>\nFor many years after the restoration of Serbian rule, Prizren and the region of\u00a0De\u010dani\u00a0to the west remained centres of\u00a0Albanian nationalism. In 1956 the\u00a0Yugoslav\u00a0secret police\u00a0put on trial in Prizren nine Kosovo Albanians accused of having been infiltrated into the country by the (hostile) Communist Albanian regime of\u00a0Enver Hoxha. The &#8220;Prizren trial&#8221; became something of a\u00a0<em>cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre<\/em> after it emerged that many leading Yugoslav Communists had allegedly had contacts with the accused. The nine accused were all convicted and sentenced to long prison sentences, but were released and declared innocent in 1968 with Kosovo&#8217;s assembly declaring that the trial had been &#8220;staged and mendacious.&#8221;<br \/>\nThe town of Prizren did not suffer much during the Kosovo War but its surrounding municipality was badly affected 1998\u20131999. During the war, most of the Albanian population were either forced or intimidated into leaving the town. About 30 were killed and over a hundred houses were burned. At the end of the war in June 1999, most of the Albanian population returned to Prizren. Serbian and Roma minorities fled. The community is now predominantly ethnically Albanian. In 2004, during the Unrest in Kosovo, some Serb cultural monuments in Prizren were damaged, burned or destroyed, such as old Orthodox Serb churches. Also, during that riot, the entire Serb quarter of Prizren, near the Prizren Fortress, was destroyed, and all remaining Serb population was evicted from Prizren.<br \/>\nThe municipality of Prizren is still the most culturally and ethnically heterogeneous of Kosovo, retaining communities of Bosniaks, Turks, and Romani in addition to the majority of Kosovo Albanian population living in Prizren. Only a small number of Kosovo Serbs remain in Prizren and area, residing in small villages, enclaves, or protected housing. Prizren&#8217;s Turkish community is socially prominent and influential, and the Turkish language is widely spoken even by non-ethnic Turks.<br \/>\n<strong>Prizren Old Town.<\/strong> A NM \u201cSight\u201d, everything south of the river is in Prizren Old Town \u2013 the fortress, Church of the Holy Saviour and Sinan Pasha Mosque.<br \/>\nThere are two trails both starting at Shadren Square: The Journey of Stone climbs up to the fortress and the 90-minute Marash Trail follows the west side of the river and then climbs up to the fortress.<br \/>\n<strong>Church of the Holy Saviour.<\/strong> On the way to the fortress, this is a tiny brick\/stone church occupies the NE corner of a high-walled courtyard. The gate on this side is locked and razor wire prevents access. Maybe it can be entered from the west?<br \/>\n<strong>Prizren Fortress.<\/strong> Built in the 4<sup>th<\/sup> and 5<sup>th<\/sup> centuries, the curved north wall has been completely restored with several casements and rooms. There are foundations of a 1808 mosque and a nice restored building housing a museum. Views down to the town are enhanced by a good sign that points out the landmarks and compares the view to Prizren in the old days.<br \/>\n<strong>Sinan Pasha Mosque.<\/strong> Next to the river, this large stone 17th-century\u00a0mosque has a great portico with 3 domes. It was locked and didn\u2019t open all morning so I assume it is not used?<br \/>\n<strong>Albanian League of Prizren Museum.<\/strong> On the north side of the river, the political and military organization League of Prizren was formed in this complex. It established the first Albanian government in 1881 and chose Prizren as its capital. In 1999, Serbian forces destroyed an important Albanian cultural monument in Prizren, the League of Prizren building, but the complex was rebuilt later on and now constitutes the Albanian League of Prizren Museum. In the round square next to the complex is a statue of the Prime Minister and ministers of foreign affairs and defence.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Brod <\/strong>(pop 900). In the NM \u201cXL\u201d series it is a village in the extreme southwest of the country, in the region of\u00a0Gora, about half the people are\u00a0Gorani, Muslim and speak Na\u0161inski. Gorani are traditionally known as good confectioners and a variety of foods.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GHAKOVA<\/strong> (Gjakove or \u0110akovica) (pop 41,000)<br \/>\nIn the south-western part of Kosovo, about halfway between the cities of Pe\u0107 and Prizren, it is approximately 100 km inland from the Adriatic Sea and 208 km north-east of Tirana, 145 km north-west of Skopje, 80 kilometres west of the capital Pristina, 435 kilometres south of Belgrade and 263 kilometres east of Podgorica.<br \/>\n<strong>History.<\/strong> The city of Gjakova has been populated since the prehistoric era. During the Ottoman period, Gjakova served as a trading center on the route between Shkod\u00ebr and Istanbul. It was also one of the most developed trade centers at that time in the Balkans with the marketplace being by the Hadum Mosque, built in 1594 by Mimar Sinan, and financed by Hadum Aga. <em><br \/>\n<\/em>Gjakova suffered greatly from the Serbian and Montenegrin armies during the\u00a0First Balkan War.\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0reported in 1912, citing Austro-Hungarian sources, that people on the\u00a0gallows\u00a0hung on both sides of the road, and that the way to Gjakova became a &#8220;gallows alley.&#8221; The Montenegrin military police committed much abuse and violence against the non-Orthodox Christian\u00a0population.<br \/>\nIn the Kosovo War, the town suffered great physical destruction, large-scale human losses and human rights abuses. About 75% of the population was expelled by Serbian police. Large areas of the town were destroyed, chiefly through arson and looting but also in the course of localized fighting. Most of the Albanian population returned following the end of the war. In 2001, thousands of new stores were rebuilt as they had been before the war.<br \/>\nIn 2011, the resident population was 94,556 (urban 40,827 and rural 53,729. The ethnic groups include Albanians (87,672), Balkan Egyptians (5,117), Roma (738), Ashkali (613), and smaller numbers of Bosniaks (73), Serbs (17), Turks (16), Gorani (13) and others. Based on those who answered, the religious make-up was 77,299 Muslims, 16,296 Roman Catholics, 22 Orthodox Christians, 142 others, and 129 irreligious.<br \/>\nGjakova has a long tradition of education &#8211; the Hadim Aga library was so rich in books that it was said &#8220;Who wants to see the Kaaba, let them visit the library of Hadim Aga&#8221;. The economy is based primarily on farming and agriculture.<br \/>\n<strong>Historical Monuments.<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Old Bazaar<\/strong> is the oldest bazaar in Kosovo serving as an Ottoman trading center and heart of the town&#8217;s economy and had 1000 businesses in 1900. It suffered damage during the Kosovo War but has since been renovated. The length of its main road is 1 km, with about 500 shops situated along it. The original street was cobbled stone, but the new pavement of tiles is already breaking up.<br \/>\n<strong>Hadum Mosque<\/strong> is located in the Old Bazaar. Built in 1594, it was financed by Hadum Aga and belongs to the Sufi order.

The entire floor is concrete with stalagmites cemented into the floor. Spelioforms are not initially frequent with a few draperies and stalactites, many broken off in the Kosovo War. One drapery could be played like an xylophone. At the end of one passage is an almost joined column, a big based column, several soda straws and something I have never seen, a large area of small crystals on the roof with branches going in all directions.

The Rugova Canyon is one of Europe&#8217;s longest and deepest canyons and is about three kilometres from the city of Pe\u0107. The city is located some 250 km north of Tirana, Albania, 150 km north-west of Skopje, 85 km west of Pristina and some 280 km east of Podgorica, Montenegro.<br \/>\nIn medieval times the city was the seat of the\u00a0Serbian Orthodox Church\u00a0in 1346. Later in 1899, the Albanian political organization,\u00a0League of Peja, was established in the city. The\u00a0patriarchal monastery of Pe\u0107\u00a0is a\u00a0UNESCO\u00a0World Heritage Site\u00a0as part of the\u00a0Medieval Monuments in Kosovo.<br \/>\n<strong>History. <\/strong>The medieval city was possibly built on the ruins of\u00a0<em>Siparant(um)<\/em>, a Roman\u00a0<em>municipium<\/em>\u00a0(town or city). Slavs settled the Balkans, heavily depopulated by &#8220;barbarians&#8221;, in the 6th century. The\u00a0Byzantine Empire\u00a0and the\u00a0First Bulgarian Empire\u00a0fought for control of the area until it finally fell under full Serbian control. Between 1180 and 1190.<br \/>\nIn 1220, Serbian King Stefan Nemanji\u0107 donated Pe\u0107 and several surrounding villages to his newly founded monastery of \u017di\u010da. As \u017di\u010da was the seat of a Serbian archbishop, Pe\u0107 came under direct rule of Serbian archbishops and later patriarchs who built their residences and numerous churches in the city starting with the church of Holy Apostles built by archbishop Saint Arsenije I Sremac. After the \u017di\u010da monastery was burned by the Cumans (between 1276 and 1292) the seat of the Serbian archbishop was transferred to a more secure location &#8211; the Patriarchal Monastery of Pe\u0107 where it remained until the abolition of the Serbian Patriarchate of Pe\u0107 in 1766.<br \/>\nThe city became a major religious center of medieval Serbia under the Serbian Emperor Stefan Du\u0161an, who made it the seat of the Serbian Orthodox Church in 1346. It retained this status until 1766 when the Serbian Patriarchate of Pe\u0107 was abolished. The city and its surrounding area are still revered by adherents of Serbian Orthodoxy; the Patriarchal Monastery of Pe\u0107 is an easy walk from the city centre.<br \/>\nPeja came under\u00a0Ottoman rule\u00a0after its capture in 1455.\u00a0The city was settled by a large number of\u00a0Turks, many of whose descendants still live in the area, and took on a distinctly oriental character with narrow streets and Ottoman-style houses. It also gained an\u00a0Islamic\u00a0character with the construction of a number of\u00a0mosques, many of which still remain. One of these is the centrally located\u00a0Bajrakli Mosque\u00a0built in the 15th century.<br \/>\nOttoman rule came to an end in the First Balkan War of 1912\u201313, when Montenegro took control of the city. Relations between Serbs and Albanians, who were the majority population, were often tense during the 20th century. They came to a head in the Kosovo War of 1999, during which the city suffered heavy damage and mass killings. More than 80 percent of the total 5280 houses in the city were heavily damaged or destroyed. It suffered further damage in violent inter-ethnic unrest in 2004.<br \/>\n<strong>Ethnic groups<\/strong><strong>. <\/strong>The vast majority of the inhabitants are\u00a0Kosovo Albanians. Most\u00a0Kosovo Serbs\u00a0live in the village\u00a0enclaves\u00a0of\u00a0Gora\u017edevac,\u00a0Belo Polje\u00a0and\u00a0Ljevo\u0161a. There is also a large\u00a0Bosniak community\u00a0while significant Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian communities are in urban and rural areas.<br \/>\n<strong>Tourism.<\/strong> Pe\u0107 is rapidly developing a significant tourist infrastructure with a new Zip Line, and two\u00a0Via Ferrata, built between 2013 and 2016.<br \/>\nYou can find information and maps for the &#8220;Trail of Cultural Monuments&#8221; at the Tourist Information Office as well as maps and attractions in the Rugova Gorge\/Canyon and surrounding mountains. Skiing is available at the Ski Center in Bog\u00eb nearby. The peak of the Balkans trail wanders through 3 countries with mountain views and can be supported by local guides and tour companies.<br \/>\n<strong>Peja Old Town.<\/strong> Pedestrianized, it does not look very old as most were reconstructed after the Kosovo War but is very attractive with dark wood store fronts, white plaster and terracotta roofs.<br \/>\n<strong>Ethnographic Museum<\/strong> (Etno Kuca).

Built in the 13th century, it became the residence of Serbian Archbishops. It was expanded during the 14th century, and in 1346, when the Serbian Patriarchate of Pe\u0107 was created, the Monastery became the seat of Serbian Patriarchs. The monastery complex consists of several churches, and during medieval and early modern times it was also used as the mausoleum of Serbian archbishops and patriarchs.
