There are countless videos of influencers touting its benefits\u2014claiming the oil can improve vision, break down belly fat, detoxify the body, get rid of wrinkles, and much more.<\/p>\n<p>Castor oil is one of the oldest drugs. Scientists have discovered castor oil in Egyptian tombs dating back to 4000 B.C. An ancient Egyptian medical text <a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/15586450\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">called the Ebers Papyrus<\/a>, dating to 1550 B.C., shows that early physicians prescribed castor oil as a laxative, to treat various eye and skin conditions, and to induce labour, among other things.<\/p>\n<p>But scientists have learned a lot about castor oil since then. While some of these modern claims are fairly innocuous, others might put your health at risk. So, which castor oil claims are grounded in science?<\/p>\n<h2><b>What is castor oil\u2014and what is it actually good for?\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Castor oil is a vegetable oil made from castor beans, which are the seeds of\u00a0<i>Ricinus communis,\u00a0<\/i>the castor oil plant. The plant is indigenous to the Mediterranean, North Africa, and India, where communities have used castor oil as a laxative and to stimulate birth for millennia.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/science\/article\/ingredients-lipstick-makeup-cosmetics-science-history\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>(Arsenic pills and lead foundation: The history of toxic makeup)<\/i><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Castor oil\u2019s noticeable laxative effect is one reason it has been around so long. Ricinoleic acid\u2014the active ingredient in castor oil\u2014causes muscle contractions. By studying mice, it was found that castor oil works on the EP3 receptor, a prostaglandin receptor that is found in several areas of the body, including the gut and cervix. Stimulating this receptor causes muscle contractions, leading the body to push out stool or induce cervical contractions that kickstart the birthing process. Mice that lacked the receptor didn\u2019t experience these effects.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved castor oil for use as a laxative, meaning that it\u2019s safe and effective to use for this reason. Several studies have also looked at whether castor oil can be safely used to induce birth, but the evidence has been more mixed, and the oil does not have FDA approval for that purpose.<\/p>\n<p>Still, most doctors probably wouldn\u2019t recommend his patients take castor oil for its laxative effects because there are more effective laxatives on the market with fewer side effects like nausea and vomiting. Plus, studies show that consistently taking castor oil can cause irritation and damage to the intestinal lining. This goes for all laxatives\u2014misusing laxatives is likely to cause serious damage to the gut and other organs over time.<\/p>\n<p>But when it comes to other uses, castor oil might be ineffective or downright dangerous.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Stomach and belly button<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Many popular videos show people smearing castor oil on their stomachs and inside their belly buttons, claiming that doing so can get rid of belly fat, improve gut health, and \u201cdetoxify\u201d the body. But those assumptions are not rooted in science.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/premium\/article\/berberine-nature-plant-ozempic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>(Some call it &#8216;nature&#8217;s Ozempic.&#8217; Are the claims too good to be true?)<\/i><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, most of these are claims, anecdotes, or personal testimonies, but they&#8217;re not based on any type of science or solid research &#8211; castor oil isn\u2019t absorbed through the skin and into the body\u2014so putting it on your skin is unlikely to affect your internal organs.<\/p>\n<p>This also means castor oil can\u2019t treat tumors close to the surface of the skin, like breast tumors, as some have claimed. There\u2019s just absolutely no evidence of that..<\/p>\n<p>While putting castor oil on your stomach only comes with a low risk of skin issues, drinking castor oil is riskier.<\/p>\n<p>When talking about safely losing weight, any weight loss method that is unproven has the risk of being not only unsafe and ineffective, but also a waste of someone\u2019s money and time. If weight loss is your goal, the best way to go about it is to develop healthy, sustainable habits.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Skin care<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>For the skin, castor oil can have positive effects. The biggest benefit castor oil offers the skin is hydration.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/science\/article\/vitamin-c-retinol-biotin-skin-care-needs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>(Vitamin C, retinol, biotin? Here\u2019s what your skin actually needs)<\/i><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The same is true for other oils, too. But while castor oil is less likely to irritate the skin than oils like olive or citrus oils\u2014plus it has some antimicrobial properties\u2014 it\u2019s not the first product she would recommend to patients. For people with acne-prone skin, castor oil can clog pores and worsen acne. There are certainly much worse [oils].<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, spreading castor oil on your face is unlikely to reduce wrinkles, as some have claimed. Researchers have yet to find evidence that castor oil, or any oil, has anti-aging effects.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Eye problems<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Experts say there\u2019s no scientific evidence backing claims that castor oil can cure eye problems like blurry vision or help your eyelashes grow longer\u2014and that people who have vision problems should talk to their physician.<\/p>\n<p>You only have two eyes and you need to take care of them. There&#8217;s not any great evidence to suggest that [castor oil] can help with things like glaucoma or improving vision. That\u2019s because these conditions are often inside the eye, and castor oil can\u2019t seep into the eyeball\u2014it only sits on the surface.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/premium\/article\/olive-oil-healthiest-oil-prevention-heart-disease-cancer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>(No food or medicine can do what olive oil can do. Here&#8217;s why.)<\/i><\/a><\/p>\n<p>In fact,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/ajmc.s3.amazonaws.com\/_media\/_pdf\/A191_08april_LempSS88to101.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">studies<\/a> have found that some people experience eye irritation and blurry vision after taking eye drops containing castor oil. Eyedrops require rigorous amounts of sterility and regulation to be considered safe to use, and sometimes homeopathic products don\u2019t meet those standards. Putting unsterilized castor oil on your eye might end up causing an infection, resulting in vision loss. Castor oil can contain things like perfumes and preservatives, which can cause irritation.<\/p>\n<p>Castor oil may have\u00a0<i>some<\/i>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S1542012420300859\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">promise<\/a>\u00a0as a dry-eye treatment, according to a small number of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S1367048409001507\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">studies<\/a>, and it is already an ingredient in some products. Scientists are also interested in researching castor oil because some patients prefer nonsynthetic eyedrops. This doesn\u2019t mean you should start putting castor oil in your eyes. Most hesitate to endorse the use of a preparation of castor oil that is not manufactured for ophthalmic use and not regulated by the FDA.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Talk to your doctor<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Even though castor oil continues to be touted as a cure-all, experts say that it\u2019s not that simple\u2014and that it\u2019s always safest to consult with your doctor. For example, castor oil could cause complications or unexpected interactions if you\u2019re also taking other drugs.<\/p>\n<p>Even as a laxative, castor oil can cause side effects and intestinal damage\u2014often an unnecessary risk given there are other, better laxatives out there.<\/p>\n<p>Still, scientists continue to research the benefits and drawbacks of castor oil\u2014and, in the future, they may have more evidence as to what castor oil can and cannot do for us.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How we should really be using castor oil Social media influencers swear by castor oil for curing blurry vision, busting belly fat, and even killing tumors.
