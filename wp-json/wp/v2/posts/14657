Finding things can be a chore. A sore back may be an unfortunate result.<br \/>\nAlso important is weight distribution and how this can adversely affect handling of the kayak, especially in rough or windy conditions.<br \/>\nIt is recommended to move boats when empty. This requires good methods for toting gear to or from the boat at the water\u2019s edge. Noodles make moving loaded boats possible with one person. 4 people with good hand straps can carry loaded boats.<br \/>\nGood organization and being able to find things easily greatly increases the enjoyment of kayaking. Using every available space is necessary.<br \/>\n*items not on a normal trip.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Weight Distribution.<\/strong> Place heavy items as low in the boat as possible and concentrated to the middle close to or in the cockpit. This significantly increases stability.<br \/>\nHeavy items on the deck compromise stability and create a high profile for wind resistance.<br \/>\nThe heaviest items are water and food. Both go into either the cockpit or in the hatch directly behind the seat. The best method I have found for water are 4.5l wine bladders in homemade nylon bags (conform to any space, empty easily and completely, no taste, use minimal space when empty).<br \/>\nPack light items in the ends of the bow as a heavy bow will cause your kayak to veer to windward, a stern heavy boat will veer downwind. Keeping boat ends light helps them lift over waves, heavy ends are sluggish and tend to plunge.<br \/>\nBe aware of sharp or hard items such a cooking pots that may wear a weak spot.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Design of kayak<\/strong> may influence some decisions. I have a Current Designs Solstice HT High Volume kayak with a 25\u201d beam. The cockpit is huge with lots of available storage space. In front of feet: sleeping bag in waterproof bags (Outdoor Research compression dry bag, one or two black plastic garbage bags twirled neck, all in 20 litre heavy dry bag. 4.5 litre wine bladder under. Behind the seat: two 2-litre juice bottles, one 4.5 litre wine bladder. 2 carry straps. Cockpit cover. Sponge. Water bottle and pee bottle on either side of seat.<br \/>\nMy second kayak is a Current Designs Solstice HTS High Volume Kevlar with a 22\u201d beam. The 2-litre juice bottles don\u2019t fit under the coaming at the back but still don\u2019t project above the coaming. One 4.5l wine bladder behind seat. Carrying both water and sleeping bag in front of feet may be difficult.<br \/>\nIf paddling with partner sharing gear using this kayak: as 10 lbs lighter, I put food and other things not needed much in the back hatch of this boat and leave it there, moving the boat with it in place.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Carrying gear<\/em><br \/>\nSmall bags only. <\/strong>Besides the taper bag and outside sleeping bag dry bag, no bags are larger than 10 litre. Day pack is the collapsible type that fits into its own pocket.<br \/>\nSmall silastic nylon bags, coffee bags are both useful to carry food. Small and long they fill up the area at the front of the back hatch.<br \/>\n<strong>Taper bags. <\/strong>Seal Line makes 2 sizes of Kodiac Saks &#8211; taper bags that fit in either the stern or bow. I find them ideal for carrying clothes. The large size fits only into the roomiest hatches and is too large. <strong><br \/>\nIKEA bags. <\/strong>Ikea produces two types of very strong, large &#8220;blue&#8221; bags that are ideal for carrying kayak gear. The &#8220;open&#8221; bag has 2 lengths of straps. The other is a backpack with a zipper. I am able to empty and carry the entire contents of my kayak on one carry with two of the open bags (one for each hatch) and one backpack bag. I have added wide nylon straps to the shoulder straps of the open bags for comfort.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nLaunching.<\/strong> Determine tides. Put boat close to water depending on if ebb or flood. Use noodles as needed. With each hatch in one Ikea bag, it is fast. Put on immersion protection, skirt and life jacket on beach. Use cheap nylon sheet or rinse bottom of Ikea bags in water to easily remove all the sand.<br \/>\n<strong>Landing.<\/strong> I immediately take an open Ikea bag full from each hatch including water and try to get boat light enough to carry.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Paddling<\/em><br \/>\n<\/strong>Spray skirt<br \/>\nPaddle<br \/>\nPaddle leash<br \/>\nPFD \u2013 whistle, knife, VHF radio, flares, small survival kit<br \/>\nTilley hat or baseball hat<br \/>\nSunglasses<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>On Front Deck<\/strong><\/em><br \/>\nDeck compass<br \/>\nSail under bungies<br \/>\n<strong>Deck bag<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013I like a deck bag even though the wind has more of an effect and rolling would be difficult: nail peg, *pogies, gloves, paddling jacket, snacks, toilet paper with lighter and shovel, sun glasses with case, sunscreen, lip, binoculars, GPS, marine radio, sail mast, *camera (in small pelican), *lens pen, *hand held compass, *strobe light, *SteriPen<br \/>\n<strong>Charts<\/strong>\u00a0in waterproof case, tide and current tables<br \/>\n*Platypus \u2013 on deck or in holder on PFD<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>On Back Deck<\/em><br \/>\n<\/strong>Paddle float<br \/>\nBilge pump<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong>Throw bag, Tow bag<br \/>\nSpare paddle<br \/>\nNoodles for rolling boat<br \/>\n*Kayak cart<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>In Cockpit<\/em><br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>In front of feet: <\/strong>Sleeping bag in compression dry bag, 2 garbage bags, over bag, pillow. 4.5 litre wine bladder water bag<br \/>\n<strong>Behind the seat:<\/strong> two 2-litre water bottles. cockpit cover, sponge, pee bottle, carry straps, 4.5 litre wine bladder<br \/>\nUnder deck bag: snacks, sunglasses, lip, sunscreen, notebook and pen<br \/>\n<strong>Beside the seat:<\/strong> Water bottle, Pee Bottle, Thermarest seat<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Front hatch. <\/strong><\/em>Generally holds day use items: lunch, hiking, dry outer clothes.<br \/>\n<strong>Taper dry bag in bow<\/strong>.
