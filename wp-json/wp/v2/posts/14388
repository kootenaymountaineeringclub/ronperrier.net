Kiribati&#8217;s 33 atolls, with a total area of only 811 km\u00b2, are scattered over an area of 3.5 million km\u00b2. Kiribati saw some of the worst fighting of the Pacific theatre during the Second World War, including the infamous Battle of Tarawa in November 1943.<br \/>\nKiribati is most emphatically\u00a0not\u00a0another\u00a0Tahiti,\u00a0Hawaii, etc. where you can go to relax and have nothing to worry about. It has few visitors, and they have to be prepared to &#8220;rough it.&#8221; That said, there aren&#8217;t many countries where the people are more friendly.<br \/>\nSouth Tarawa is one of the most densely populated, severely poverty-stricken places in the world. Other islands have far fewer people, but getting to them can be difficult, and conditions are even more primitive. Most tourists, especially from the USA, go to\u00a0Kiritimati\u00a0(Christmas Island). It received some attention on 1 January 2000 as the first location in the world to experience the new millennium. Conditions there are somewhat better than in the rest of Kiribati.<br \/>\nThe Phoenix and Line Islands were generally held to be on the east side of the International Date Line and are in different time zones from the Gilbert Islands group, but on 1 January 1995, Kiribati proclaimed that all of its territory was on the same calendar day (skipping 31 December 1994 in those island groups), effectively extending the Date Line further eastward to accommodate this. This makes the Line Islands the farthest &#8220;ahead&#8221; of any territory on the planet.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"image\" href=\"https:\/\/wikitravel.org\/en\/File:Kiribati_regions_map.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"thumbimage\" src=\"https:\/\/wikitravel.org\/upload\/shared\/\/thumb\/7\/79\/Kiribati_regions_map.png\/450px-Kiribati_regions_map.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wikitravel.org\/upload\/shared\/\/thumb\/7\/79\/Kiribati_regions_map.png\/675px-Kiribati_regions_map.png 1.5x, https:\/\/wikitravel.org\/upload\/shared\/\/thumb\/7\/79\/Kiribati_regions_map.png\/900px-Kiribati_regions_map.png 2x\" alt=\"Kiribati regions map.png\" width=\"450\" height=\"323\" data-file-width=\"2380\" data-file-height=\"1709\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>KIRIBATI Summary <\/strong>Jan 1-5<strong><br \/>\n<em>KIRIBATI \u2013 GILBERT ISLANDS and BANABA<\/em><\/strong> (Tarawa)<br \/>\n<strong>Visa.<\/strong> Visa-free for up to 30 days.

However, on the ground was different. The drive to the hotel was depressing on the only road in the country. There was a speed bump every 100 metres to protect the thousands of little kids. Besides some sturdier concrete block houses, most homes were a mishmash of corrugated metal, fibreboard, plywood, tarps and sheets of plastic &#8211; all very poverty-stricken. The yards were dirt with nothing growing like a garden.

Under British colonial rule, it was known as the Gilbert Islands and was administered along with the neighbouring group Ellice Islands (now the independent Polynesian nation of Tuvalu). Kiribati was granted self-rule by the UK in 1971 and complete independence in 1979. The US relinquished all claims to the sparsely inhabited Phoenix and Line Island groups in a 1979 treaty of friendship with Kiribati. The presence of gun emplacements and shipwrecks from WWII battles on South Tarawa makes shipwreck diving a common tourist activity.<br \/>\n<strong>Politics.<\/strong> In 1995 Kiribati suspended diplomatic relations with\u00a0France\u00a0to protest the latter&#8217;s decision to resume nuclear testing on\u00a0Muraroa Atoll. In 1999 the government claimed that two atolls had been lost due to sea level rise and subsequently, in 2002, joined with\u00a0Tuvalu\u00a0and the\u00a0Maldives\u00a0to take legal action against the US for refusing to sign the Kyoto Protocol.<br \/>\n<strong>Climate.<\/strong> Whoever coined the phrase, &#8220;It&#8217;s not the heat, it&#8217;s the humidity&#8221; may have had Kiribati in mind. Actually, the average high temperatures are quite reasonable compared to other well-known places in the tropics (such as\u00a0Bangkok,\u00a0Singapore,\u00a0Manila, etc.). But the humidity more than makes up for this, making it feel very sauna-like. The wet season varies, but is usually December to March, give or take a month. Severe drought also occurs at times.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SEE<br \/>\n<\/strong>Except for\u00a0Banaba\u00a0(Ocean Island &#8211;\u00a06 km\u00b2, pop.~300), all the main islands are in one of three groups: the Gilbert Islands, the Line Islands, and the Phoenix Islands.<br \/>\nBeach scenery (lagoons, white sandy beaches and waving palm trees) and boating or yachting on many of the atolls are lovely to explore on bike or foot. Traditional culture\u00a0is still very much alive. The Kiribati people are generally friendly and welcoming to visitors, and will include you in their celebrations if you happen to be around.<br \/>\n<strong>Kiribati Music and Dance Festival.\u00a0<\/strong>Kiribati folk music and dance is unique to the region, with chanting accompanied by body percussion and guitar, while dance is typically bird-like with costumed performers.\u00a0<em>Maneaba<\/em>\u00a0have music and dance nightly in-season.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><a class=\"image\" title=\"Gilbert Islands\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/File:GilbertIslandsPos.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/7\/75\/GilbertIslandsPos.png\/400px-GilbertIslandsPos.png\" srcset=\"\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/7\/75\/GilbertIslandsPos.png\/600px-GilbertIslandsPos.png 1.5x, \/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/7\/75\/GilbertIslandsPos.png\/800px-GilbertIslandsPos.png 2x\" alt=\"Gilbert Islands\" width=\"400\" height=\"304\" data-file-width=\"2371\" data-file-height=\"1804\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">1.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, several were exploited for natural resources like guano and coconuts, and in 1957 the British government conducted atmospheric nuclear tests near Malden Island. But none of that human impact is evident underwater.<\/span><\/span><strong><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\u201cIf an alien had just one day on Earth and wanted to see a coral reef,\u201d says National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence Enric Sala, \u201cI would show him Millennium Atoll.\u201d<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><br \/>\nWhat that alien would see is one part of perhaps the most pristine archipelago in the Pacific: five remote isles named Caroline (commonly called Millennium), Flint, Vostok, Malden, and Starbuck, together known as the southern Line Islands. The waters around these uninhabited specks of land, located 1,500 to 2,100 miles south of Hawaii, are among the last truly wild places in an overexploited ocean.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The Kiribati government recently declared a 12-nautical-mile fishing exclusion zone around each island. \u201cThese islands help us understand what \u2018pristine\u2019 means,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom every perspective\u2014coral density, fish biomass, the number of top predators, the biodiversity\u2014their ecological story is amazing.\u201d<br \/>\n<\/span><\/span>On some reefs, the corals were so dense they covered 90 percent of the seabed\u2014vastly more than the 5 to 10 percent coral coverage found in the Caribbean. Additionally, they seem to be unaffected by bleaching or disease even though this region was hit hard by ocean warming. Corals tend to be resilient in places where other elements of the marine ecosystem are flourishing too. In parts of the lagoon at Millennium, densities of giant clams reach up to four per square foot\u2014an almost unheard-of abundance for creatures highly sought for their meat and shells. \u201cGiant clams have been decimated in most atoll lagoons,\u201d says Sala. \u201cIn Millennium Lagoon the reefs are paved with clams.\u201d<br \/>\nThe most common species, Tridacna maxima, is better known by a name that seems to contradict itself: the \u201csmall giant clam.\u201d These mollusks are a little longer than an American football, but they are dwarfed by individuals from the largest clam species, Tridacna gigas, which can exceed four feet in length. At first glance, the small giants look like they\u2019re wearing blue, indigo, green, or another shade of lipstick. The colour comes from pigment cells inside their fleshy mantles, which protrude like wavy lips when the shells are open.<br \/>\nThe giant filter feeders act as water purifiers. Microbiologists on the expedition measured bacterial concentrations at every atoll they visited and found Millennium\u2019s clam-filled lagoon to have the lowest count. Bacteria can cause diseases in coral, fish, shellfish, and crustaceans such as crabs. Low concentrations in seawater are an indication of a healthy marine ecosystem.<br \/>\nBut none of that human impact is evident underwater. Sala and his team recorded 325 fish species in the southern Line Islands, and estimates of fish biomass (total weight) were some of the highest ever reported from a coral reef. At several locations, divers saw endangered Napoleon wrasses, one of the world\u2019s largest reef fish. Also known as the humphead wrasse because of a pronounced bump on the forehead of mature adults, these fish can grow to more than six feet long\u2014large enough to sometimes have their escort fish, as sharks and large rays do.<br \/>\nThe waters around the islands showed the \u201cinverted biomass pyramid\u201d of healthy reefs, in which top predators, as measured by cumulative weight, account for most of the fish\u2014at Malden Island, more than 70 percent. Predator dominance had been previously reported at Kingman Reef. \u201cIt\u2019s a seascape of fear, everything is either hunting or being hunted.\u201d<br \/>\nOn one dive at dusk\u2014what Skerry calls the \u201cshark witching hour\u201d\u2014he found himself hemmed in by gray reef sharks. \u201cThere must have been 60 of them,\u201d he says. \u201cI was trying to photograph in a three-sided coral head, and one of them would come in really close. Usually, a shark will go away, at least temporarily, if you fend it off, but these guys were doing a quick 360-degree turn and coming right back, and behind that one were five more, and behind them another ten, and you could see them jockeying for position. In 36 years of diving, I\u2019ve had some dicey moments with predators, but I\u2019ve never felt physically hunted, as I was here.\u201d<br \/>\nThat abundance of predators could easily be lost. Sala reckons it would take just a few months for a large vessel to strip the reefs of sharks, which are hunted for their fins. The health of the ecosystem could then quickly plummet. Without top predators, midrange predators would likely proliferate, herbivore numbers tumble, and algae overtake the coral.<br \/>\nAt Millennium Island divers saw two sharks with stainless steel hooks in their mouths, one of them trailing a length of fishing line. A French sailor moored in the lagoon said he had seen a long liner working offshore.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Diving:\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><a title=\"THE SOUTHERN LINE ISLANDS\" href=\"http:\/\/Southern Line Islands\">http:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2014\/09\/27\/the-southern-line-islands\/<\/a><br \/>\n<a title=\"Kingman Reef \u2013 Line Islands\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2014\/10\/01\/kingman-reef-line-islands\/\">http:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2014\/10\/01\/kingman-reef-line-islands\/<\/a><\/span><\/span><strong><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><br \/>\nCaroline <\/span><\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">XL<\/span><\/span><strong><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><br \/>\nFlint\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">XL<\/span><\/span><strong><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><br \/>\nMalden\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">XL<\/span><\/span><strong><br \/>\nStarbuck Island\u00a0<\/strong>XL<br \/>\n<strong>Teraina (Washington Island)\u00a0<\/strong>XL<br \/>\n<strong>Vostok Island\u00a0<\/strong>XL<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">3.

Most other Western countries may enter visa-free for up to 30 days.<br \/>\n<strong>By plane.<\/strong> If the tickets are too expensive, get to Fiji any way you can and go from there. On the other hand, if you&#8217;ve got thousands to spend and extra time, see how a Round the World fare on OneWorld or Star Alliance compares with the fare to Tarawa and include this on your itinerary.<br \/>\nSolomon Airlines has a service which flies from Brisbane to Tarawa, the cheapest way to get to Tarawa, at roughly half the cost of the flight from Fiji. This service is a joint venture with Air Kiribati.<br \/>\nFiji Airways has two weekly non-stop flights (3 hrs) from Nadi, Fiji with connections from Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Canada, and the United States including Honolulu (with codeshares on American Airlines, and possibly other ONEWORLD members). If using another airline to get to Fiji, be certain it lands in Nadi and not Suva (unless you&#8217;re staying a while and can get to the other side of the island).<br \/>\nAir Marshall Islands does scheduled flights every 2 weeks from Majuro to Tarawa CW117 returning the same day. Air Marshall Islands email amisales@ntamar.net Phone number is +692 625-3733, calling is suggested as emails often go unanswered.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GET AROUND<br \/>\n<\/strong>Domestic Flights and Airlines in Kiribati\u00a0Air Kiribati has two turboprop aircraft for inter-island travel. Flights travel to all Outer Islands in the Gilbert group regularly. A new domestic carrier has also been set up recently Coral Sun Airways. Coral Sun offers a scheduling alternative to Air Kiribati and can also be chartered for private use.<br \/>\nThe reliability of internal flights in Kiribati is improving all the time and fares are relatively cheap. It is important to reconfirm your return flight on arrival at your destination. Each airline has different booking and confirmation conditions, you need to ensure you are familiar with these to ensure a hassle-free trip.<br \/>\n<strong>Talk.<\/strong> The official languages of Kiribati are English and Gilbertese &#8211; also known as Kiribati.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Money.<\/strong>\u00a0The official currency of Kiribati is the\u00a0Kiribati dollar ($). The currency is pegged 1:1 with the\u00a0Australian dollar ($), and both currencies are universally accepted across Kiribati.<br \/>\nATM&#8217;s are located in Betio, Bairiki and Bikenebeu. There is also one located at the hospital. There is also a foreign exchange office at the Airport. The Australian bank ANZ operates in Kiribati. Most shops will only accept cash, as credit cards are rarely used&#8211;except for the two hotels.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ACCOMMODATION<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>South Tarawa.<\/strong> The two main hotels are Mary&#8217;s Motel and the government-owned Otintaai Hotel located at different ends of South Tarawa.<br \/>\nNorth Tarawa. The best way to experience village life in Kiribati is guesthouses and traditional-style accommodation.<br \/>\nGilbert Island Group and Council Guesthouses. Each island has a council guesthouse &#8211; a mix of the local-style houses known as Kia Kia\u2019s and open-style guest rooms. Each guesthouse usually has a communal living area where meals are served and the cost is approximately $30 per night including 3 meals a day. Recommended that fresh drinking water is taken. Each council will normally have a truck and driver that you will be able to hire to help you discover the island. Alternatively, many of the locals will be keen to hire motorcycles and scooters.<br \/>\n<strong>Kiritimati Island\u00a0<\/strong>This world-renowned bone fishing destination has a variety of fishing lodges, guesthouses, and motels to choose from.<\/p>\n<p><strong>STAY SAFE<\/strong><br \/>\nKiribati is generally a safe place and virtually all problems are caused by adults&#8217; excessive drinking habits, not career criminals.<br \/>\n<strong>Health.<\/strong> Don&#8217;t drink the water without boiling or filtering. Chemical treatment is not recommended as it may not prevent giardiasis. The lagoon (especially around Beito) is heavily contaminated and may make the entire island segment smell bad at times. Always ask first before going out in the water at each location on South Tarawa, no matter how inviting it looks. This is a good idea on other islands too. Get a hepatitis A shot, and be up-to-date on all other vaccinations. Mosquitoes can be very bad at times, so use repellent.<br \/>\nThere&#8217;s no malaria, but dengue fever outbreaks occur. The fish caught locally may give you food poisoning (ciguatera). Ciguatera is not preventable by cooking or freezing the fish. Promptly treat even the smallest cut, sore, or insect bite, as these can become infected very easily.<br \/>\nMedical evacuation insurance\u00a0is\u00a0highly\u00a0recommended for Kiribati. Many outer islands have no airstrip, making any sort of evacuation long and difficult.<\/p>\n<p><strong>RESPECT. <\/strong>The &#8216;katei&#8217; or traditional way of life involves a strong sense of personal pride, respect for one another and a consistently open welcome to &#8216;irua&#8217; or &#8216;bwaroko&#8217; meaning foreigners. \u00a0This behaviour is commonly experienced by foreigners who are called into the homes and meeting places of the locals. Uncommon to Western society, the I-Kiribati people have great respect towards their elderly citizens and religious leaders regardless of their denomination (almost all are of Christian background). \u00a0It is common to observe intoxicated people returning home to approach missionaries and apologize for being drunk. Many individual communities have laws specific to their village as decided by the elders of that village. \u00a0Respect for these laws is strongly maintained to keep order and harmony in the communities.<br \/>\nContact. www.kiribatitourism.gov.ki E-mail: info@kiribatitourism.gov.ki Phone: (+686) 25573 and ask for the Tourism Office.
