The lake level is at 537 meters. Much of the upper Sharp Creek trail was overgrown but has been renovated (see Sharp Creek Trail). The meadows are 310 meters higher than Wee Sandy Lake, at 2250 meters (7400 feet).<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong>The eastern summit is surveyed four meters higher but is not named.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Map:<\/strong> 82F\/13 Burton.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Routes:<br \/>\n<\/strong>1. North Glacier, East Ridge. Cross Slocan Lake by boat. It is best to do this climb in two days; a one-day ascent is very strenuous. Above, the trail ascends a series of headwalls, but only the third is obvious. In places, there is high grass in slide alder with some flagging. There are good campsites in the forest by the creek along the way and one can camp also above the tree line. The ascent is interesting because it passes through several ecological zones.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Climb up a moraine and then polished rock to the edge of the ice, and reach the col east of the eastern, higher peak (crampons). Turning the bergschrund presents a little difficulty (rope), then traversing above it and gaining the east ridge (Class 3, lichens slippery when wet) and the east summit on solid rock.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Descend to the glacier (Do not descend south to regain the ridge; a gendarme blocks the way.), and gain the east ridge of Mount Denver (Class 3) and the summit. The cairn has a record, and one was left in 1907.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Ice, Glacier (II,4,s). <span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><em>FA 1907.\u00a0Prospectors had probably ascended it before 1907.<\/em><\/span><br \/>\n2.
