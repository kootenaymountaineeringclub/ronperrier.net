After independence and partition in 1947, it became one of the poorest bits of Pakistan. And after it declared itself an independent country, Bangladesh, in 1971, it became poorer still, as the rump of Pakistan fought a savage war to retain it, destroying a big share of its few assets and killing many of its best and brightest.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap\" data-caps=\"initial\">Few could have predicted how the tables would turn. This week marks 50 years since Bangladesh\u2019s first president, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, declared independence on March 26th 1971. Over the intervening period the country\u2019s income per person has surpassed Pakistan\u2019s and is approaching India\u2019s (see left-hand chart). Before the pandemic, economic growth exceeded 7% for four years in a row, outpacing not just Pakistan and India, but even China.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Bangladeshis are not just vastly wealthier, but healthier and better educated too. Some 98% of Bangladeshi children finish primary school, compared with less than a third during the 1980s. Literacy has soared (see chart). Infant mortality has plunged. Virtually everyone uses a toilet rather than defecating in the open. In all these respects, Bangladesh is doing better than both Pakistan and India.<\/p>\n<div class=\"article__body-text-image\">\n<figure>\n<div data-slim=\"1\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/608\/1202\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210327_ASC297_0.png\" sizes=\"300px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/200\/395\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210327_ASC297_0.png 200w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/300\/593\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210327_ASC297_0.png 300w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/400\/791\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210327_ASC297_0.png 400w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/600\/1186\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210327_ASC297_0.png 600w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/640\/1265\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210327_ASC297_0.png 640w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/800\/1582\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210327_ASC297_0.png 800w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/1000\/1977\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210327_ASC297_0.png 1000w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/1280\/2531\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210327_ASC297_0.png 1280w\" alt=\"\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Devastating as the war of independence was, in some ways it set Bangladesh on the path to success. Many expatriates came home to help their new country recover. Zafarullah Chowdhury, who dropped out of university in Britain, set up a charity that helped to distribute cheap generic drugs and contraceptives. Fazle Hasan Abed sold his flat in London to return before founding another charity,\u00a0<small>brac<\/small>, that taught mothers how to rehydrate children suffering from diarrhoea, turning it from a deadly illness to a nuisance.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">The overstretched government was only too happy to allow aid agencies and\u00a0<small>ngo<\/small>s to take on such tasks. In a drive in the 1980s to vaccinate children against diseases like polio, the country was split down the middle: the government took one half,\u00a0<small>brac<\/small>\u00a0the other. By the end of the decade the immunisation rate had risen from 2% to 80%.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Charities like\u00a0<small>brac<\/small>\u00a0had an especially big impact because they targeted women. By the 1990s it was running 64,000 schools, which were not only educating girls but employing women to teach in them. There are now more girls in high school than boys (another difference from India and Pakistan).\u00a0<small>brac<\/small>\u00a0and other organisations also popularised microcredit, turning millions of rural women into entrepreneurs.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Bangladesh\u2019s booming garment industry has helped to improve women\u2019s welfare, too, argues Rubana Huq of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association. The share of women in paid work has risen from 3% 50 years ago to 36% today. Some 80% of Bangladesh\u2019s 4m garment workers are women. Their work \u201cearns them economic freedom and dignity at home and outside\u201d, says Ms Huq.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">The garment industry has become the world\u2019s second largest, accounting for 11% of\u00a0<small>gdp<\/small>\u00a0and 80% of export revenue. Successive governments have helped mainly by getting out of the way, simplifying labour laws and removing import duties on inputs. This free-market approach was crucial in fomenting growth, says Fahmida Khatun of the Centre for Policy Dialogue, a think-tank in Dhaka.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Yet Bangladesh\u2019s politics is as depressing as its development is uplifting. Sheikh Mujib tried to turn the country into a one-party state, but was quickly assassinated. The current prime minister, his daughter, Sheikh Hasina Wazed, seems determined to make his vision a reality. Since coming to power for a second time in 2009, she has abolished the practice of holding elections under an impartial caretaker government. The main opposition figure, Khaleda Zia, was arrested in 2015. She has since been convicted of corruption and banned from politics in a trial she says was politically motivated. Before the most recent election, in 2018, opposition parties claimed that more than 7,000 of their activists had been arrested. Many opposition candidates, like Ms Zia, were barred from running owing to criminal convictions. Sheikh Hasina\u2019s Awami League and its allies won 288 of 300 seats.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">It is not just opposition activists, but also journalists and other critics of the government who increasingly wind up behind bars. In 2018 the government introduced the Digital Security Act, supposedly to curb religious radicalism and pornography online. But its vague provisions, which include stiff jail sentences for those who post \u201caggressive or frightening\u201d content, have been used to silence critics of all sorts. Mushtaq Ahmed, a writer, was arrested last year after criticising the government\u2019s response to covid-19 on Facebook. He died in prison last month, having been denied bail six times.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Members of the Awami League, meanwhile, easily secure bail for serious crimes, if they are charged at all. Government contracts often go to the party\u2019s cronies. State-owned banks are weighed down by loans that well-connected borrowers decline to repay. There is no point going to court: the party with the closer ties to the Awami League always wins. \u201cWe literally don\u2019t have breach of contract cases anymore,\u201d explains Shahdeen Malik, a lawyer who argues cases before the Supreme Court. The tax code, which relies more on levies on consumption than on income or wealth, is also skewed in favour of the rich and politically connected.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">The iniquities of this system are beginning to be reflected in the economic data. Between 2010 and 2016 the richesthouseholds saw their income rise by nearly a quarter, while the poorest households saw theirs decline by a third. Zahid Hussain, a former lead economist on Bangladesh for the World Bank, blames the rent-seeking behaviour of the elite. Corruption knocks two percentage points off\u00a0<small>gdp<\/small>\u00a0growth each year, the bank has estimated. At any rate, foreign investment has stagnated, perhaps owing in part to the caprice of the courts.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Covid-19 has exacerbated inequality by pushing millions who had escaped poverty back into it. The proportion of Bangladeshis living below the national poverty line has risen from around a quarter to 40% or so, says Asif Saleh, the head of\u00a0<small>brac<\/small>. No one is able to travel abroad for work anymore, which bodes ill for future flows of remittances. These reached almost $20bn last year. Garment factories have been battered by cancellations, as lockdowns abroad have crimped sales of clothing.<\/p>\n<div class=\"article__body-text-image\">\n<figure>\n<div data-slim=\"1\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/608\/1202\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210327_ASC297_0.png\" sizes=\"300px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/200\/395\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210327_ASC297_0.png 200w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/300\/593\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210327_ASC297_0.png 300w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/400\/791\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210327_ASC297_0.png 400w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/600\/1186\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210327_ASC297_0.png 600w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/640\/1265\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210327_ASC297_0.png 640w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/800\/1582\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210327_ASC297_0.png 800w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/1000\/1977\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210327_ASC297_0.png 1000w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/1280\/2531\/90\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/print-edition\/20210327_ASC297_0.png 1280w\" alt=\"\" \/><\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">The increase in women\u2019s participation in the workforce has slowed, notes Ms Huq. Between 2005 and 2010it grew by 1.7 percentage points a year on average, but since then by only 0.7 percentage points a year. She thinks women\u2019s rights are in retreat, too. Without the rule of law or political accountability, violence against women goes unchecked, she argues.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">By centralising power in herself, Sheikh Hasina has also added an element of political uncertainty. As tight as her grip on her country is, it cannot endure past the grave. She is 73, but has no clear successor. Relatives and other close allies appear to be jockeying for position. Her son, Sajeeb Wazed, is an adviser to the government. His sister, Saima Wazed, who had been living in Canada, has recently been given a number of government jobs, prompting speculation that she is being groomed for power. Other contenders include their cousin, Radwan Mujib Siddiq Bobby, who has begun publishing a magazine about public policy, and Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, the mayor of South Dhaka. His parents were assassinated along with Sheikh Hasina\u2019s in 1975. None of them has the same venerable status as Sheikh Hasina, however, and none is a plausible reformer.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Some speculate that change may come from the army, which has seized control several times in the past. But Sheikh Hasina has a tight grip on it, too. Al-Jazeera, a broadcaster based in Qatar, recently exposed the close personal ties between Sheikh Hasina and the current army chief.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Others fear Islamic radicalism. In 2016 religious extremists killed 24 people at a restaurant and bakery in Dhaka. Sheikh Hasina has cracked down on some Islamist groups, cajoling the courts to ban a prominent Islamic party, Jamaat-e-Islami, which fought alongside Pakistan in the war of independence. But she has cosied up to others, including Hefazat-e-Islam, which has agitated against the secularism for which the Awami League theoretically stands. Ordinary Bangladeshis, some 90% of whom are Muslim, have grown more religiously observant in recent years, but few seem to hanker for a theocracy.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Indeed, so complete has the Awami League\u2019s control become that it is hard to know what ordinary Bangladeshis do want. Most will presumably be content if their personal welfare improves in the future as rapidly as it has done over the past 50 years. That happened largely in spite of Bangladesh\u2019s politicians, however, not thanks to them.<\/p>\n<p>=============================================================<\/p>\n<div class=\"css-1r2sn2n e1mrg8dy0\">\n<section class=\"css-11w0l54 e139ysjh0\">\n<h1 class=\"css-1bo5zl0 e164j1a30\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Bangladesh\u2019s economic miracle is in jeopardy<\/strong><\/span><\/h1>\n<h2 class=\"css-13b9ga2 e1fr8l080\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Corrupt politics has become a bigger threat to the country than poverty<\/span><\/h2>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"css-kpd7oo e1mrg8dy0\">\n<section class=\"css-q176th ekjxuah0\">\n<figure class=\"css-qbtggm e12yhaj20\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_ASP002.jpg\" sizes=\"(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=360,quality=80,format=auto\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_ASP002.jpg 360w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=384,quality=80,format=auto\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_ASP002.jpg 384w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=480,quality=80,format=auto\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_ASP002.jpg 480w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=600,quality=80,format=auto\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_ASP002.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=834,quality=80,format=auto\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_ASP002.jpg 834w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=960,quality=80,format=auto\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_ASP002.jpg 960w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_ASP002.jpg 1096w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_ASP002.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_ASP002.jpg 1424w\" alt=\"A man knits traditional Banarasi Saree in Dhaka, Bangladesh, December 20, 2021.

Since a brutal war of independence from Pakistan in 1971, it has made remarkable social and economic progress.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">A billiard-table-flat land on the combined floodplain of some of Asia\u2019s biggest rivers, the country was once a byword for poverty, famine and natural disasters. Today, with a population of 170m, devastating human losses to cyclones are, thanks to shelters and warning systems, a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/the-economist-explains\/2022\/06\/23\/how-does-bangladesh-cope-with-extreme-floods\" data-analytics=\"in_body:link_1:para_2\">thing of the past<\/a>. So, too, are widespread food shortages. Child mortality rates are slightly better than the global average and half those of Pakistan. Female literacy, not long ago abysmal, is now 73%. The share of women in paid work has climbed from 4% at independence to 35%, largely thanks to a thriving garment industry.<\/p>\n<div class=\"article__body-text-image\">\n<figure><span data-slim=\"1\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/608\/667\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_ASM997.png\" sizes=\"336px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/200\/219\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_ASM997.png 200w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/300\/329\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_ASM997.png 300w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/400\/439\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_ASM997.png 400w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/600\/658\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_ASM997.png 600w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/640\/702\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_ASM997.png 640w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/800\/878\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_ASM997.png 800w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/1000\/1097\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_ASM997.png 1000w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/1280\/1404\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_ASM997.png 1280w\" alt=\"\" \/><\/span><\/figure>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">In the decade before covid-19, Bangladesh grew at an average annual rate of 7%, only slightly slower than China. Its\u00a0<small>gdp<\/small>\u00a0per person, around $2,500 at market prices, is higher than India\u2019s. It is expected to graduate from the\u00a0<small>un<\/small>\u2019s ranks of least developed countries (<small>ldc<\/small>s) in late 2026. It aims be an upper-middle-income country by 2031.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Yet hard-won optimism about Bangladesh\u2019s trajectory is now being tested. The pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine have caused a serious economic shock to the country. It is gripped by a cost-of-living crisis. One manifestation is that the streets of Dhaka, the teeming capital, have this winter been filled with huge numbers of rough sleepers wrapped in flimsy shawls. Another is that at the central bank, the country\u2019s foreign-currency reserves have been alarmingly run down.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">On the political front, an election is due by the beginning of next year. Its outcome is not in serious doubt: Sheikh Hasina, the increasingly autocratic prime minister, has done what she can to destroy the opposition. Yet her zero-sum approach to politics has raised tensions that are likely to spark violence as the vote looms. Down but not quite eliminated, leaders of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (<small>bnp<\/small>) are already in the streets. Meanwhile, the stench of corruption in Dhaka is as acrid as the capital\u2019s polluted air. Far from stepping into a bright future, Bangladesh appears in key respects to have lost its way.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"article__body-text-image\">\n<figure><span data-slim=\"1\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/608\/662\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_ASC167.png\" sizes=\"336px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/200\/218\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_ASC167.png 200w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/300\/327\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_ASC167.png 300w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/400\/436\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_ASC167.png 400w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/600\/653\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_ASC167.png 600w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/640\/697\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_ASC167.png 640w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/800\/871\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_ASC167.png 800w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/1000\/1089\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_ASC167.png 1000w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/1280\/1394\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_ASC167.png 1280w\" alt=\"\" \/><\/span><\/figure>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">The energy and bustle of Bangladeshis are still on display in the malls and factories of Dhaka and beyond. Such dynamism is the engine of the country\u2019s unpredicted success. After the war, many of its people returned from abroad to help rebuild. One launched a charity<small>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/international\/2019\/09\/05\/how-brac-the-worlds-biggest-charity-made-bangladesh-richer\" data-analytics=\"in_body:link_2:para_6\">brac<\/a>,<\/small>\u00a0which focused on women\u2019s and children\u2019s health, ran schools and set up microfinance schemes.\u00a0<small>ngo<\/small>s performed wonders to boost gender equality, which in turn improved many social, health and economic outcomes. Some developing states, including India and Pakistan, view\u00a0<small>ngo<\/small>s as political threats. Bangladesh\u2019s overstretched government embraced them. Now\u00a0<small>brac<\/small>\u00a0is an export success, running services in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Two-fifths of the population still work on the land. Yet road-building by the World Bank and others has connected villages with towns, boosting local farm markets. The garment industry that sprang up around Dhaka is world-class. The government helped by scrapping duties and outdated labour laws.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Sheikh Hasina, in power since 2009, has sought to drive a new phase of growth by splurging on infrastructure. Power has long been patchy. The capital has satanic levels of traffic congestion and air pollution. Crossing the riverine country is a challenge. But last year a huge road (and, soon, rail) bridge opened across the Padma River, the main channel in Bangladesh of the mighty Ganges, transforming the country\u2019s economic geography. In Dhaka, a Japan-backed elevated metro is going up, along with a new airport terminal. Everywhere, power plants are being built. Much of this construction is only worsening congestion in the short term. Longer-term, the bottlenecks should ease.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Despite such visible progress, foreign diplomats, independent analysts and even thoughtful members of the ruling Awami League (<small>al<\/small>) in private express serious concerns. These run along several fronts, economic and political, though all are related. One is balance-of-payments vulnerabilities. Another is an overreliance on the garment industry. Overarching all is a grave worry about governance. A web of state capture and decay has spread through the country\u2019s institutions.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">These weaknesses have been laid bare by a familiar set of woes, including the fuel- and food-price inflation and fleeing capital that the war in Ukraine has visited upon the developing world. Bangladesh\u2019s foreign-currency reserves have slumped to under $30bn. Last year the government called in the<small>\u00a0imf<\/small>\u00a0as a precaution. In January a $4.7bn loan was agreed. Yet the local currency, the taka, remains wobbly. And as the government puts the brakes on imports, in part by doubling down on the requisite inspections and permits, exporters are finding it hard to bring in the foreign inputs they need. They are also struggling to get hard currency to back letters of credit. Without those, they cannot trade.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">The garment industry poses a longer-term concern. Overreliance on it, says Fahmida Khatun of the Centre for Policy Dialogue, a think-tank in Dhaka, represents a \u201cserious weakness\u201d. The sector\u2019s future is uncertain. Graduating from\u00a0<small>ldc<\/small>\u00a0status will mean losing some tariff exemptions in Western markets. Lower-cost producers, such as in Cambodia and Ethiopia, threaten to take the same bite out of Bangladesh\u2019s market share that it took from China\u2019s.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Other export industries struggle to grow. Bangladesh is a member of no major regional trade pact. It has attracted little of the other sorts of production being moved out of China. Though some domestic sectors such as pharmaceuticals and electronics have potential, appalling bureaucracy and uneven customs duties hold them back. The\u00a0<small>eiu,<\/small>\u00a0a sister company of\u00a0<i>The Economist<\/i>, ranks Bangladesh\u2019s business environment 15th out of 17 Asian countries.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">That speaks to the country\u2019s biggest concern. Its dire governance touches nearly every corner of the country\u2019s affairs\u2014even the external account. Bangladesh\u2019s rich and corrupt have made it a money-laundering world leader. Bangladeshis have a slang for those upscale districts of Toronto and other Western cities where their rich have parked money:\u00a0<i>begum para<\/i>, or \u201cbegum [\u201dhigh-ranking woman\u201d] areas\u201d<i>.\u00a0<\/i>If it were not for a remarkable, 10m-strong army of mainly poor Bangladeshis, toiling in the Gulf, South-East Asia and elsewhere and remitting money home, the country\u2019s balance of payments would be even worse.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Business and politics are conjoined. Non-performing loans have risen, thanks to banks favouring the politically connected with loans they do not repay. A powerful cabal of politicians, bureaucrats and the security services extorts fees that are the downpayment for accomplishing anything\u2014from getting off an unfair traffic fine, to winning a government contract, to joining the coastguard, to applying to be a primary-school teacher. Far from being valued as they dearly deserve to be, those overseas-remittances workers are routinely shaken down at immigration.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Sheikh Hasina claims she is cracking down on corruption. In truth, the state is rotting from the head. She has constructed a personality cult around her late father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country\u2019s independence hero\u2014and by extension around herself. Her patronage system and demand for loyalty underpin her power, while destroying independent institutions. The police and the courts are in the service of the\u00a0<small>al<\/small>\u00a0and its cronies. The press is not free. Dissidents are in jail; some have been murdered. Even on punchy university campuses the\u00a0<small>al<\/small>\u00a0rules by fear, via its swaggering, sometimes violent student wing. A first-year undergraduate says he had to toady to its leaders to get a dorm room. Bright young Bangladeshis say they yearn to move abroad.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Sheikh Mujibur tried to make Bangladesh a one-party state before, in 1975, he and much of his family were assassinated. His daughter has all but completed the task. This is the context for the coming election. Sheikh Hasina long ago dispensed with the practice of holding elections under an impartial caretaker government. That way, the\u00a0<small>al\u00a0<\/small>can more easily control the results.<\/p>\n<h2>Sheikh\u2019s rattle and roll<\/h2>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">With her arch-rival, Khaleda Zia, under house arrest and her party, the\u00a0<small>bnp,<\/small>\u00a0hounded, the election\u2019s outcome is already known. Yet the\u00a0<small>bnp<\/small>, no less thuggish now than when it was in power, has recently recovered sufficiently to launch mass protests in Dhaka. It raises the risk of mob violence, and deepening political divisions.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">It is only one of several worrying scenarios. Sheikh Hasina is 75 and has not anointed a successor. Younger family members lack either the experience or will to take over. If a stroke were to take the prime minister tomorrow, the country could fall into chaos.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Not all is gloom. Impressive to any visitor is how cheerfully and relentlessly young Bangladeshis look to themselves to solve problems. Theirs, says one Dhaka observer, is \u201ca country of side-hustles\u201d. People run e-commerce businesses from their bedrooms. A journalist keeps a dozen buffaloes outside the capital and supplies mozzarella to upmarket pizzerias. Over dinner in such places, people speak of their hopes for a better, more representative Bangladesh, one that gives opportunities rather than takes them away. At the moment, though you say it in public at your peril, the main obstacle to that future is the apparatus of wasted opportunities presided over by their prime minister.\u00a0<span data-ornament=\"ufinish\">\u25a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>=============================================================<\/p>\n<div class=\"css-1r2sn2n e1mrg8dy0\">\n<section class=\"css-11w0l54 e139ysjh0\">\n<h1 class=\"css-1bo5zl0 e164j1a30\">Is Bangladesh\u2019s admired growth model coming unstuck?<\/h1>\n<h2 class=\"css-13b9ga2 e1fr8l080\">A development superstar faces malign politics and rising corruption<\/h2>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"css-kpd7oo e1mrg8dy0\">\n<section class=\"css-q176th ekjxuah0\">\n<figure class=\"css-qbtggm e12yhaj20\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_LDP502.jpg\" sizes=\"(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=360,quality=80,format=auto\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_LDP502.jpg 360w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=384,quality=80,format=auto\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_LDP502.jpg 384w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=480,quality=80,format=auto\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_LDP502.jpg 480w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=600,quality=80,format=auto\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_LDP502.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=834,quality=80,format=auto\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_LDP502.jpg 834w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=960,quality=80,format=auto\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_LDP502.jpg 960w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_LDP502.jpg 1096w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_LDP502.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/www.economist.com\/cdn-cgi\/image\/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_LDP502.jpg 1424w\" alt=\"A worker pulls his cycle rickshaw loaded with bundles of cloth in Dhaka on January 9, 2023.

The \u201cbasket case\u201d, in Henry Kissinger\u2019s noxious phrase, that emerged in 1971 from the ravages of the third India-Pakistan war was widely considered a failed state in the making. It was poor, overcrowded, badly run and prey to violent cyclones and the vicissitudes of the great rivers meandering across it. Yet Bangladesh celebrated its\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/asia\/2021\/03\/27\/as-it-turns-50-bangladesh-is-doing-well-despite-its-politicians\" data-analytics=\"in_body:link_1:para_1\">first half-century<\/a>\u00a0in 2021 as a secular democracy, a model of frugal social development and South Asia\u2019s standout\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/asia\/2017\/09\/07\/bangladeshs-gdp-per-person-is-now-higher-than-pakistans\" data-analytics=\"in_body:link_2:para_1\">economic performer<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap\" data-caps=\"initial\">Thanks to the dynamism of its activists, the country has long embraced progressive social policies. They have brought advances in particular for women and girls, who are more educated, likelier to be employed and have fewer and healthier children than their counterparts in India (let alone Pakistan). On the back of such progress, and a garments industry that was a winner from China\u2019s rising labour costs, economic growth picked up. As we explain, in the ten years before covid-19 struck,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/asia\/2023\/03\/01\/bangladeshs-economic-miracle-is-in-jeopardy\" data-tegid=\"1l2bi51392upgti0te80gpj9afsp09m9\" data-analytics=\"in_body:link_3:para_2\">Bangladesh<\/a>\u00a0grew at an annual rate of 7%, not far off China\u2019s 8%. Its\u00a0<small>gdp\u00a0<\/small>per head at market prices, of about $2,500, is higher than India\u2019s. In 2026 it is due to be promoted from the\u00a0<small>un<\/small>\u2019s ranks of least developed countries. Its ambition to be an upper-middle-income country by 2031 should be plausible.<\/p>\n<div class=\"article__body-text-image\">\n<figure><span data-slim=\"1\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/608\/509\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_LDC191.png\" sizes=\"336px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/200\/167\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_LDC191.png 200w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/300\/251\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_LDC191.png 300w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/400\/335\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_LDC191.png 400w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/600\/502\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_LDC191.png 600w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/640\/536\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_LDC191.png 640w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/800\/670\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_LDC191.png 800w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/1000\/837\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_LDC191.png 1000w,https:\/\/www.economist.com\/img\/b\/1280\/1072\/90\/media-assets\/image\/20230304_LDC191.png 1280w\" alt=\"\" \/><\/span><\/figure>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">However, those prospects are now clouded. Beset by conditions that afflict many developing countries, including rising import costs, scarcer capital and balance-of-payments pressures, Bangladesh was forced in January to secure a $4.7bn loan from the<small>\u00a0imf<\/small>. It is not nearly as straitened as crisis-ridden\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/asia\/2023\/02\/07\/pakistan-is-at-risk-of-default\" data-analytics=\"in_body:link_4:para_3\">Pakistan<\/a>\u00a0or\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/the-economist-explains\/2022\/07\/19\/why-is-sri-lanka-in-turmoil\" data-analytics=\"in_body:link_5:para_3\">Sri Lanka<\/a>, but it ought to be held to a higher standard.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">To maintain its progress Bangladesh will require a step-up in its economic performance. Yet its troubles have exposed structural and political weaknesses that point in the other direction: to a serious risk of deterioration.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Bangladesh is over-reliant on garments, which make up about 85% of its total goods exports. They may soon lose the preferential trade terms associated with Bangladesh\u2019s least-developed status, even as competition from lower-cost producers such as Cambodia is rising. And Bangladesh\u2019s efforts to diversify into higher-value-added industries, such as pharmaceuticals and electronics, are unimpressive. They are hampered by graft, red tape, difficulties in obtaining credit and a relentless brain drain, all of which have a common cause: the corrupt and controlling regime of Sheikh Hasina, the prime minister since 2009.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Almost every area of the economy is touched by her bid to turn Bangladesh into the one-party state envisaged by her assassinated father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country\u2019s first president. Access to jobs, permits and government contracts runs through the ruling Awami League. Many domestic banks are thinly disguised shell operations, designed to funnel loans to the well-connected. Foreign direct investment has begun to flag in the past few years; the country\u2019s ratings for doing business are the worst in South Asia. In an election due early next year, violence is looking increasingly likely as Sheikh Hasina\u2019s beleaguered opponents take to the streets.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">The 75-year-old prime minister\u2019s commitment to strong government is not irrational. Bangladesh has suffered spasms of instability, including 29 attempted military coups. Still, she has taken authoritarianism to its limit in a society with deep traditions of pluralism and debate. Easing her party\u2019s grip is the necessary next step towards building a more durable governing culture and, it might be added, to securing her family\u2019s legacy and perhaps its safety. It is also essential to restoring the independent institutions that will be the foundation for the country\u2019s future growth\u2014which is likely to be\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/leaders\/2021\/03\/27\/bangladeshs-growth-has-been-remarkable-but-is-now-at-risk\" data-analytics=\"in_body:link_6:para_7\">harder to generate<\/a>\u00a0than its growth so far.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">Western governments are reluctant to apply pressure. They doubt they have much influence with Sheikh Hasina and are wary of China\u2019s growing investments in Bangladesh. Yet they have more sway than they know. Members of the country\u2019s elite prize their links with the West, from business opportunities to educating their children; and Bangladesh relies more on foreign capital than in the past.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article__body-text\">The stakes are high. As the climate warms, the environmental threats to Bangladesh are outpacing its progress. Assuming a temperature rise of 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, the country could see 13m climate migrants and a third of its agricultural output wiped out by 2050, says the World Bank. Such a disaster could destabilise an acutely sensitive region. It could even make Mr Kissinger look prescient. If it is to mitigate that risk, Bangladesh cannot afford to become mired in oppressive one-party politics. It needs to get richer quicker.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<div class=\"css-1opcn9 e4uu0hm0\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>FROM RAGS to STITCHES &#8211; As it turns 50, Bangladesh is doing well, despite its politicians.
