It is one part of the 400 km-long Kootenay Arc, made of sedimentary, volcanic and metamorphic rock. The Slocan Valley is located in the Selkirk Mountains which were created 200 million years ago, during the Jurassic period.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><br \/>\nHistory.<\/strong> The valley has been the home of the Sinixt people since time immemorial. When silver was discovered near Sandon in the 1890s, thousands of prospectors arrived in the valley, but by 1910, many of the small towns had become deserted. Larger silver-base metals mines were produced through the 1970s e.g. the Ottawa mine and the Arlington mine on Springer Creek and the Enterprise mine on the namesake creek.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Since then, a legacy of settlement from people disaffected with the government has occurred in the Slocan Valley.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A group of pacifists, the\u00a0Doukhobors\u00a0(originally a Russian sect of Christianity) arrived to farm in nearby Brilliant in 1908 and later spread into the Slocan Valley.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">During the\u00a0Second World War, a policy of\u00a0Japanese Canadian Internment\u00a0saw many\u00a0Japanese Canadians\u00a0(including a young\u00a0David Suzuki) re-located to\u00a0internment camps\u00a0in the valley, some of whom have stayed.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In 1967 self-proclaimed war resisters of the\u00a0Vietnam War, attracted to the Green Power movement (see Maclean&#8217;s Magazine May 1968) and welcomed by the existing contingent of Russian pacifists, started making the valley their home.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Since the 1970s, the population has steadily increased as telecommuters, commuters, people interested in a rural lifestyle and the children of earlier immigrants have worked to make themselves a suitable home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Tourism.<\/strong> The Slocan Valley is a stop-spot for tourists.
