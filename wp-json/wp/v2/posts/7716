After sawing out a few deadfalls and re-building the road in 4-5 spots, we followed the route on easier terrain as it turned south into Mohawk Creek drainage (keep left about km. 5). A couple of hours from Camborne, we reached the broken bridge over Mohawk Creek (km. 7, 4600\u2019, GPSed at 585-225), where we stopped driving.

This we easily scaled by the SW ridge\/S face, reaching the top via snow and rock 5 hrs. from camp (GR 617-211, 8596\u2019). After brunch, we dumped all our climbing gear as the way ahead seemed easy, headed NE on snow, descended to the glacial col at 617-216, and scrambled the easy SW ridge of Beak Pk. on solid rock in 45 min.
