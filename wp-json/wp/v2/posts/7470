(surveyed elevation) by Kim Kratky\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Car approach: drive Highway 31A to Keen Creek turnoff, 7.6 km. west of Kaslo. Follow Keen Creek road for 8 km. to a big mine dump. Just past the dump turn left onto Ben Hur mainline road. At 200 m., go straight. At. km. 1.6 turn right (signposted &#8220;Ben Hur m\/l&#8221;). Follow the road through several cut blocks to its end at around km. 5 (5100&#8242;). The Ben Hur section needs a 4WD vehicle for its upper sections (steep).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Approach on foot: Leaving the vehicle at the end of Ben Hur road, follow the creek S. along its W. bank through a cut block which quickly gives way to open timber and fairly unpleasant bushwhacking (slide alder, devil&#8217;s club, rhododendron). Traverse unpleasant mossy boulder fields and continue over a buttress W of a lake to reach the alps W. of Chipman (about 3 hrs. from the car).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The climb: From the basin, ascend moderately steep snow on Chipman&#8217;s west face to reach the south ridge (1100&#8242;). Then follow good granite on the class 3 south ridge to the summit without difficulty (1 hr. from basin). A cairn was found on the summit. (note, Earle: this peak may have been climbed by John Carter or Steve Kent of BC Parks). <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Return via ascent route. Later in the season, the snow of the west face would give way to rock; thus, a different route might be more practical. However, we&#8217;re not talking about anything difficult, here. We returned to the truck by traversing NW from the basin at 962-238 and then descending a snow tongue parallel to the ridge NE of Satisfaction Pk. This was somewhat better than the approach, but there was still considerable bushwhacking farther down. Return was made from the summit in 2 hrs. 50 min. The total day was 7 hours. 30 min.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Pinnacles along the ridge N. of the summit and subsidiary peaklets to the N. would seem to offer good rock climbing. Access may be better from cut blocks located between Deer and Ben Hur Creeks along the long forested ridge extending N. from the summit.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">SUMMARY: Mt.
