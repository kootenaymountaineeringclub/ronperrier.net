People.<\/strong> Jamaicans themselves are eztremely pleasant and welcoming to tourists after 2 years of not having many. They just relaxed thier Covid rules (to none) in mid April. But it appears to be a 100% black country and white folks stick out like sore thrumbs.<br \/>\nThe poverty seems significant. Many appear to drive thier income in the casual work sector selling vegetables or fruit on roadside stands. One gets panhandled quite a bit.<br \/>\nThere are a lot of nice homes but all are behind big walls topped with razor wire or electrical fencing.<br \/>\nJamaican hair is an experience. Some women wear attachments but both men and women rely heaviily on complicated braiding.<br \/>\n<strong>2. Tourists.<\/strong> Most must go to resorts as I saw virtually no white people anywhere except occasionaly walking on roads around resort areas.<br \/>\n<strong>3. What to see.<\/strong> There is not much of interest except beaches for resorts (virtually all private). There are several waterfalls especially along the north coast (Ocho Rios has several).<br \/>\n<strong>4. Costs.<\/strong> Food is relatively cheap. Gas is 2.24 JD (US$1.46) for Octane 87. My car was $75\/day to rent. Most museums are cheap but other places (Plantation houses, Bob Marley Museum and nicer waterfalls) are $25 entry, very expensive at world prices.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Day 1<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/span><strong>CORNWALL<\/strong>\u00a0 (Montego Bay, Negril) May 4-5, 2022<br \/>\n<em>I arrived after my flight from FLL at 11:30 and it took a while to rent a car (Island Car Rental, Toyota Corolla, about $70\/day, milage 165446), got Digicel SIM card and was driving by 1:30.\u00a0<\/em><em><br \/>\n<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>MONTEGO BAY\u00a0<\/strong>(pop 500,000) Montego Bay\u00a0is the capital of the\u00a0parish\u00a0of\u00a0St. James\u00a0in\u00a0Jamaica.

In 1831, the strike turned into an armed rebellion that was savagely suppressed by the British with hundreds tried and executed in Montego Bay Market on May 23, 1832, including Mr Sharpe. This though led to the end of enslavement in 1834.

Port Royal, Jamaica, commonly referred to as &#8220;the wickedest city on earth&#8221; conjures images of marauding pirates, daring naval conquests, looting, riches, destruction and devastation. It boats an intriguing and turbulent history as it rapidly grew to become the most important trading post in the New World. At the height of its glittering wealth, on June 7, 1692, Port Royal was consumed by an earthquake and two thirds of the town sank into the sea. A series of fires and hurricanes followed and the town was never restored to its former glory. Port Royal lived out its days as a British naval station and remains as a small fishing village today.<br \/>\nGenerally archaeological excavations represent a long period of time where buildings were constructed, renovated, added, fell into disrepair, were abandoned, collapsed and perhaps built over. In contrast, after just 37 years of existence, the bustling city of Port Royal literally sank into the harbour in a matter of minutes, remaining perfectly preserved as it was on the day of the earthquake.<br \/>\n<em>The Port Royal Cay.\u00a0<\/em>Port Royal is situated on the end of an 18-mile-long sand spit known as the Palisadoes, 15 miles from the centre of Kingston. Currently, the peninsula is one continuous strip although at various times throughout its history, the tip on which Port Royal stands was a cay completely surrounded by water.<br \/>\n<em>Pre 1692.\u00a0<\/em>Regular occupation at the site began when Britain captured Jamaica from Spain in 1655. The English immediately recognized the cay&#8217;s strategic importance in defending the island from the threat of recapture by the Spanish or the possibility of French invasion. They set about fortifying the place and completed Fort Cromwell (later renamed Fort Charles) in less than two years. Construction continued over the next two decades until six well-armed forts surrounded the little cay. Thus Port Royal, during its period of prosperity, was better defended than any of its contemporary Spanish cities, such as Cartagena, Havana, Vera Cruz or Porto Bello.<br \/>\nWithin this fortified area the town grew rapidly. Due to its safe and protected location, its flat topography and deep water close to shore, large ships could easily glide in to be serviced, loaded and unloaded. Along with the ships, sailors and merchants alike established themselves to benefit from the many trading and outfitting opportunities there. Between 1655 and 1692, Port Royal grew faster than any town founded by the English in the New World. In 1662 Port Royal recorded 740 inhabitants. At its&#8217; height in 1692, population estimates vary from 6500 to 10,000. With approximately 2000 buildings densely packed into 51 acres, a realistic estimate would be between 6500 and 7000 inhabitants of whom perhaps 2500 were slaves.<br \/>\nCentred on the slave trade as well as export of sugar and raw materials, Port Royal became the mercantile hub of the Caribbean and the most economically important English port in the Americas. The city boasted merchants, artisans, tradesmen, captains, slaves, and notorious pirates who all participated in an expansive business network. It had a governor&#8217;s house, king&#8217;s house (court of chancery), four churches and a cathedral. Many of the buildings were made of brick, indicating a certain amount of wealth not found at other contemporaneous settlements. Inventories of Port Royal&#8217;s citizens reveal much prosperity and the observation that, unlike the other English colonies, Jamaica used coins for currency instead of commodity exchange.<br \/>\nDuring the early days&#8217;of Port Royal&#8217;s development, officially sanctioned privateering was also a common practice. Privateers or Buccaneers were awarded official contracts from England to raid Spanish, Dutch and French ships in the Caribbean. Part of the booty was reserved for the Crown and the rest flowed into the coffers of Port\u00a0Royal&#8217;s bawdy citizens. While, this practice was officially ended by the 1670 Treaty of Madrid, privateering and\/or piracy, continued well into the 18th century. In 1689, nearly half of the population was involved in this trade.<br \/>\nThis then, was Port Royal at its zenith, a vibrant city centre with expensive goods flowing through the harbour day in and day out. See Captain John Taylor, writing in 1688, described Port Royal as &#8220;a formidable City: well built, strongly fortified, and Populated by a valiant Inhabitant.&#8221; He counted some 600 brick houses and an equal number built of timber. According to Taylor they were mainly four stories high with cellars, tiled roofs and sash windows and had large shops and storehouses attached.<br \/>\n<em>Earthquake and Post 1692.\u00a0<\/em>In the midst of this decadence, Port Royal was struck by a severe earthquake at 20 minutes to noon, June 7, 1692. Three violent shocks, each stronger than the previous ripped the earth followed by a giant tidal wave. Within minutes, two-thirds of the entire town disappeared underwater. Nearest to the water&#8217;s edge, the streets filled with warehouses were the first to go. The cemetery sank while the church tower crumbled to the ground. One by one, the Forts disappeared under the rising waves.<br \/>\nOf the original 51 acres, 20 sank to a depth of 10 feet and 13 slid to a depth of 35 feet. Two thousand people died immediately and a further 3000 died of injuries and disease shortly after.<br \/>\nWhile most survivors fled to the mainland, some did remain. Officials like the secretary, receiver-general, and port officers were soon ordered back to work. Trade and privateering were also revived and Spanish treasure was soon filling the coffers once more.<br \/>\nBut disaster struck again when a great fire broke out in a warehouse on January 9, 1703. The fire spread quickly, aided by large quantities of gunpowder and other flammable material stored in the various areas of town. The narrow streets and the close proximity of buildings made salvaging almost impossible. By midnight the entire town was reduced to ashes.<br \/>\nFollowing the fire, a contentious Bill was proposed that would shift all commerce to the growing centre of Kingston. Merchants were in favour of relocating as they claimed Kingston was healthier and safer than Port Royal. Seamen and sailors countered that Kingston was too difficult for their ships to access. Afier much argument, the Bill was rescinded and both cities were left to develop side by side. However, Port Royal was never to recover as an important commercial core. A series of hurricanes in 1712, 1722, 1726 and 1744 damaged the town to such an extent that it never recovered its former significance as a merchant epicenter. For the rest of the century, Port Royal&#8217;s role and importance shifted as it became the main British naval centre in the Caribbean.<br \/>\n<em>Port Royal &#8211; 18th century to the present.\u00a0<\/em>Port Royal&#8217;s role as a British Naval Station extends from 1713 to 1905. During this time, the Station grew in size and tactical efficiency and Port Royal began to shelter fleets for offensive operations.<br \/>\nFrom 1715 to 1763, a dockyard was founded and consistently expanded in order to facilitate large navy ships. By 1770 it was properly equipped to handle trans-Atlantic voyages. Between 1763 and 1815, the dockyard was efficiently administrated and a new careening wharf was built south of the existing one. Naval operations officially ceased in 1905. Today, Port Royal is a small fishing village with a population of about 2000.<br \/>\nAs the focus of this submission is the sunken city of Port Royal, on the surface, there is little to immediately suggest the town&#8217;s turbulent past. Most of Port Royal&#8217;s secrets lay deep under the water and considerable work has been conducted on the section that remains submerged.<br \/>\n<strong>Physical description.\u00a0<\/strong>Early excavations excavated remains of the fish and meat markets, two taverns, and three ships located along the western edge of the city.

They resisted the European colonial system in this isolated region by establishing a network of trails, hiding places and settlements, which form the Nanny Town Heritage Route and associated remains, i.e. secret trails, settlements, archaeological remains, look-outs, hiding places etc., bear exceptional witness to the phenomenon of grand marronage as characterized by Windward Maroon culture which, in the search for freedom from colonial enslavement, developed a profound knowledge of, and attachment to, their environment, that sustained and helped them to achieve autonomy and recognition.<br \/>\nThe forests offered the Maroons everything they needed for their survival. They developed strong spiritual connections with the mountains, still manifest through the intangible cultural legacy of, for example, religious rites, traditional medicine and dances.<br \/>\nThe site is also a biodiversity hotspot for the Caribbean Islands with a high proportion of endemic plant species, especially lichens, mosses and certain flowering plants.<br \/>\nThe cultural and natural heritage of the Blue and John Crow Mountains comprises 26,252 ha of tropical, montane rainforest within the larger Blue Mountain and John Crow Mountain ranges. These two ranges cover approximately 20% of the island\u2019s total landmass and are recognised for their biodiversity significance within the Caribbean Region. The property spans elevations from 850m to 2,256m asl. The high elevation, rugged landscape and the north and south-facing slopes of the mountains of the property have resulted in a wide variety of habitat types with nine ecological communities within the upper montane forest of the Blue Mountains (over 1,000m) and John Crow Mountains (over 600m). These include a unique Mor Ridge Forest characterised by a deep layer of acidic humus with bromeliads and endangered tree species. Above 1,800m, the vegetation of the Blue Mountains is more stunted with some species restricted to these altitudes. Above 2,000m the forest is known as Elfin Forest due to the stunted and gnarled appearance of the trees which are heavily coated with epiphytes including hanging mosses, ferns and tiny orchids.<br \/>\nThere is an exceptionally high proportion of endemic plant and animal species found in the property, Jamaica having evolved separately from other landmasses. In addition, the property hosts a number of globally endangered species, including several frog and bird species.<br \/>\nThe area is rugged, remote with limited access thereby providing additional security against some threats. The boundaries of the property are well designed to include the key attributes of its biodiversity values. Nevertheless there are a range of current and potential threats to the property, including from invasive alien species, encroachment, mining, fire and climate change.<br \/>\nIt took almost 3 hours to drive through the park from south to north on a very windy, mostly one-lane road.

As a teenager he was introduced into the high society in which most of his plays would be set. Coward achieved enduring success as a playwright, publishing more than 50 plays from his teens onwards. Many of his works, such as\u00a0<i>Hay Fever<\/i>,\u00a0<i>Private Lives<\/i>,\u00a0<i>Design for Living<\/i>,\u00a0<i>Present Laughter<\/i>, and\u00a0<i>Blithe Spirit<\/i>, have remained in the regular theatre repertoire. He composed hundreds of songs, in addition to well over a dozen musical theatre works (including the operetta\u00a0<i>Bitter Sweet<\/i>\u00a0and comic\u00a0revues), screenplays, poetry, several volumes of short stories, the novel\u00a0<i>Pomp and Circumstance<\/i>, and a three-volume autobiography. Coward&#8217;s stage and film acting and directing career spanned six decades, during which he starred in many of his own works, as well as those of others.<br \/>\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War, Coward volunteered for war work, running the British propaganda office in Paris. He also worked with the Secret Service, seeking to use his influence to persuade the American public and government to help Britain. Coward won an\u00a0Academy Honorary Award\u00a0in 1943 for his naval film drama\u00a0<i>In Which We Serve<\/i>\u00a0and was\u00a0knighted\u00a0in 1969. In the 1950s he achieved fresh success as a cabaret performer, performing his own songs, such as &#8220;Mad Dogs and Englishmen&#8221;, &#8220;London Pride&#8221;, and &#8220;I Went to a Marvellous Party&#8221;.<br \/>\nCoward&#8217;s plays and songs achieved new popularity in the 1960s and 1970s, and his work and style continue to influence popular culture. He did not publicly acknowledge his homosexuality, but it was discussed candidly after his death by biographers including\u00a0Graham Payn, his long-time partner, and in Coward&#8217;s diaries and letters, published posthumously. The former Albery Theatre (originally the New Theatre) in London was renamed the\u00a0No\u00ebl Coward Theatre\u00a0in his honour in 2006.<\/p>\n<p><strong>OCHO RIOS\u00a0<\/strong>(Spanish for &#8220;Eight Rivers&#8221;; pop 17,000) is a town on the north coast of\u00a0Jamaica, and is more widely referred to as\u00a0<i>Ochi<\/i>\u00a0by locals.

Many of the indigenous people either were killed or died of diseases, after which the Spanish brought large numbers of African slaves to Jamaica as labourers.\u00a0Named\u00a0Santiago\u00a0by the Spanish, the island remained a possession of Spain until 1655, when England conquered it, renaming it\u00a0Jamaica. Under British colonial rule, Jamaica became a leading sugar exporter, with a plantation economy dependent on the African slaves and later their descendants. The British fully emancipated all slaves in 1838, and many freedmen chose to have\u00a0subsistence farms\u00a0rather than to work on plantations. Beginning in the 1840s, the British began using Chinese and Indian\u00a0indentured\u00a0labour to work on plantations. The island achieved independence from the United Kingdom on 6 August 1962.<br \/>\nWith 2.9 million people,\u00a0Jamaica is the third-most populous\u00a0Anglophone\u00a0country in the\u00a0Americas\u00a0(after the\u00a0United States\u00a0and\u00a0Canada), and the fourth-most populous country in the Caribbean.\u00a0Kingston\u00a0is the country&#8217;s capital and largest city. The majority of\u00a0Jamaicans\u00a0are of\u00a0Sub-Saharan African\u00a0ancestry, with significant\u00a0European,\u00a0East Asian\u00a0(primarily\u00a0Chinese),\u00a0Indian,\u00a0Lebanese, and mixed-race minorities.\u00a0Due to a high rate of emigration for work since the 1960s, there is a large\u00a0Jamaican diaspora, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The country has a global influence that belies its small size; it was the birthplace of the\u00a0Rastafari\u00a0religion,\u00a0reggae\u00a0music (and associated genres such as\u00a0dub,\u00a0ska, and\u00a0dancehall), and it is internationally prominent in sports, most notably\u00a0cricket,\u00a0sprinting\u00a0and\u00a0athletics.\u00a0Having punched so higha above its weight, Jamaica is often considered the world\u2019s least populous\u00a0cultural superpower.<br \/>\nJamaica is an upper-middle-income country\u00a0with an economy heavily dependent on tourism; it has an average of 4.3 million tourists a year.\u00a0Jamaica performs favourably in measurements of\u00a0press freedom\u00a0and\u00a0democratic governance. It ranked first in the Caribbean on the\u00a0World Happiness Report\u00a0for 2021.\u00a0Politically it is a\u00a0Commonwealth realm, with\u00a0Elizabeth II\u00a0as\u00a0its queen.\u00a0Her appointed representative in the country is the\u00a0Governor-General of Jamaica.<br \/>\n<strong>Etymology.\u00a0<\/strong>The\u00a0indigenous people, the\u00a0Ta\u00edno, called the island\u00a0Xaymaca\u00a0in their\u00a0language,\u00a0meaning the &#8220;Land of Wood and Water&#8221; or the &#8220;Land of Springs&#8221;.\u00a0Yamaye\u00a0has been suggested as an early Ta\u00edno name for the island as recorded by\u00a0Christopher Columbus.<br \/>\nColloquially, many present-day Jamaicans refer to their home island as the &#8220;Rock&#8221;. Slang names such as &#8220;Jamrock&#8221;, &#8220;Jamdown&#8221; (&#8220;Jamdung&#8221; in\u00a0Jamaican Patois), or briefly &#8220;Ja&#8221;, have derived from this.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HISTORY<br \/>\nPrehistory. <\/strong>Humans have inhabited Jamaica from as early as 4000\u20131000 BC. Little is known of these early peoples.\u00a0Another group, known as the &#8220;Redware people&#8221; after their pottery, arrived circa 600 AD,\u00a0followed by the Ta\u00edno circa 800 AD, who most likely came from\u00a0South America.\u00a0Though often thought to have become extinct following contact with Europeans.<br \/>\n<strong>Spanish rule (1509\u20131655). <\/strong>Christopher Columbus was the first European to see Jamaica, claiming the island for Spain after landing there in 1494 on his second voyage to the Americas.\u00a0His probable landing point was Dry Harbour, called\u00a0Discovery Bay,[35]\u00a0and\u00a0St. Ann&#8217;s Bay\u00a0was named &#8220;Saint Gloria&#8221; by Columbus, as the first sighting of the land. He later returned in 1503; however, he was shipwrecked and he and his crew were forced to live on Jamaica for a year while waiting to be rescued.<br \/>\nThe Ta\u00ednos began dying in large numbers, both from introduced diseases and from enslavement by the Spanish.\u00a0As a result, the Spanish began importing slaves from Africa to the island.<br \/>\nMany slaves managed to escape, forming autonomous communities in remote and easily defended areas in the interior of Jamaica, mixing with the remaining Taino; these communities became known as\u00a0Maroons.\u00a0Many Jews fled the Spanish Inquisition\u00a0to live on the island.\u00a0They lived as\u00a0conversos\u00a0and were often persecuted by the Spanish rulers, and some turned to\u00a0piracy against the Spanish Empire&#8217;s shipping.<br \/>\nBy the early 17th century it is estimated that no more than 2,500\u20133,000 people lived on Jamaica.<br \/>\n<strong>Early British period. <\/strong>Henry Morgan\u00a0was a famous\u00a0Caribbean pirate, privateer, plantation owner and slaveholder; he had first come to the West Indies as an indentured servant, like most of the early English colonists.<br \/>\nThe English began taking an interest in the island and,\u00a0led an\u00a0invasion of Jamaica\u00a0in 1655.<br \/>\nWhen the English captured Jamaica, most Spanish colonists fled, with the exception of Spanish Jews, who chose to remain on the island. Spanish slave holders freed their slaves before leaving Jamaica.\u00a0Many slaves dispersed into the mountains, joining the already established\u00a0maroon\u00a0communities.\u00a0During the centuries of slavery,\u00a0Jamaican Maroons\u00a0established free communities in the mountainous interior of Jamaica, where they maintained their freedom and independence for generations.<br \/>\nMeanwhile, the Spanish made several attempts to re-capture the island, prompting the British to support pirates attacking Spanish ships in the Caribbean; as a result piracy became rampant on Jamaica, with the city of\u00a0Port Royal\u00a0becoming notorious for its lawlessness. Spain later recognised English possession of the island with the\u00a0Treaty of Madrid (1670).\u00a0After that, the English authorities sought to rein in the worst excesses of the pirates.<br \/>\nIn 1660, the population of Jamaica was about 4,500 white and 1,500 black.\u00a0By the early 1670s, as the English developed sugar cane plantations worked by large numbers of slaves, black Africans formed a majority of the population.\u00a0The\u00a0Irish in Jamaica\u00a0also formed a large part of the island&#8217;s early population, making up two-thirds of the white population on the island in the late 17th century, twice that of the English population.<br \/>\n<strong>18th\u201319th centuries. <\/strong>During the 1700s the economy boomed, based largely on sugar and other crops for export such as\u00a0coffee,\u00a0cotton\u00a0and\u00a0indigo. All these crops were worked by black slaves, who lived short and often brutal lives with no rights, being the property of a small planter-class.\u00a0In the 18th century, slaves ran away and joined the Maroons in increasing numbers, and resulted in The\u00a0First Maroon War\u00a0(1728 \u2013 1739\/40), which ended in stalemate. The British government sued for peace, and signed treaties in 1739 and 1740.<br \/>\nA large slave rebellion, known as\u00a0Tacky&#8217;s War, broke out in 1760 but was defeated by the British and their Maroon allies.\u00a0After the\u00a0second conflict\u00a0in 1795\u201396, many Maroons from the Maroon town of\u00a0Cudjoe&#8217;s Town (Trelawny Town)\u00a0were expelled to\u00a0Nova Scotia\u00a0and, later,\u00a0Sierra Leone.\u00a0Many slaves ran away and formed independent communities under the leadership of escaped slaves such as\u00a0Three-Fingered Jack,\u00a0Cuffee\u00a0and at\u00a0Me-no-Sen-You-no-Come.<br \/>\nBy the beginning of the 19th century, Jamaica&#8217;s dependence on slave labour and a plantation economy had resulted in black people outnumbering white people by a ratio of almost 20 to 1.<br \/>\nThe British\u00a0abolished the slave trade\u00a0in 1807, but not the institution itself.\u00a0In 1831 a huge slave rebellion, known as the\u00a0Baptist War, broke out, led by the Baptist preacher\u00a0Samuel Sharpe. The rebellion resulted in hundreds of deaths and the destruction of many plantations, and led to ferocious reprisals by the\u00a0plantocracy\u00a0class.\u00a0As a result of rebellions such as these, as well as the efforts of abolitionists, Britain outlawed slavery in its empire in 1834, with full\u00a0emancipation\u00a0from chattel slavery declared in 1838.\u00a0The population in 1834 was 371,070, of whom 15,000 were white, 5,000 free black; 40,000 &#8220;coloured&#8221; or\u00a0free people of colour\u00a0(mixed race); and 311,070 were slaves.\u00a0The resulting labour shortage prompted the British to begin to &#8220;import&#8221;\u00a0indentured servants\u00a0to supplement the labour pool, as many freedmen resisted working on the plantations.\u00a0Workers recruited from India began arriving in 1845, Chinese workers in 1854.\u00a0Many South Asian and Chinese descendants continue to reside in Jamaica today.<br \/>\nOver the next 20 years, several epidemics of\u00a0cholera, scarlet fever, and\u00a0smallpox\u00a0hit the island, killing almost 60,000 people (about 10 per day).\u00a0The 1871 census recorded a population of 506,154 people &#8211; 13,101 white, 100,346 coloured (mixed black and white), and 392,707 black.\u00a0This period was marked by an economic slump, with many Jamaicans living in poverty. Dissatisfaction with this, and continued racial discrimination and marginalisation of the black majority, led to the outbreak of the\u00a0Morant Bay rebellion\u00a0in 1865 which was put down by\u00a0with brutality. It became a Crown Colony in 1866.\u00a0In 1872 the capital was transferred from Spanish Town to Kingston.<br \/>\n<strong>Early 20th century<br \/>\n<\/strong>In 1907 Jamaica was struck by\u00a0an earthquake\u2014this, and the subsequent fire, caused immense destruction in Kingston and the deaths of 800\u20131,000 people.<br \/>\nUnemployment and poverty remained a problem for many Jamaicans. Various movements seeking political change led by Marcus Garvey, father of the Back to Africa Movement and Jamaica&#8217;s first National Hero, a prominent\u00a0Pan-Africanist\u00a0and proponent of the\u00a0Back-to-Africa movement.\u00a0He was also one of the chief inspirations behind Rastafari, a religion founded in Jamaica in the 1930s that combined Christianity with an\u00a0Afrocentric\u00a0theology focused on the figure of\u00a0Haile Selassie, Emperor of\u00a0Ethiopia. Despite occasional persecution, Rastafari grew to become an established faith on the island, later spreading abroad.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Great Depression\u00a0of the 1930s hit Jamaica hard. Jamaica slowly gained increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom. Jamaica attained full\u00a0independence\u00a0on 6 August 1962.\u00a0The new state retained its membership in the\u00a0Commonwealth of Nations. Bustamante, at the age of 78, became the country&#8217;s first prime minister.<br \/>\n<strong>Post-independence era. <\/strong>Strong economic growth, averaging approximately 6% per annum, marked the first ten years of independence fuelled by high levels of private investment in\u00a0bauxite\/alumina,\u00a0tourism, the manufacturing industry and, to a lesser extent, the agricultural sector.<br \/>\nThe optimism of the first decade was accompanied by a growing sense of inequality among many Afro-Jamaicans, and a concern that the benefits of growth were not being shared by the urban poor, many of whom ended up living in crime-ridden shanty towns in Kingston.\u00a0This, combined with the effects of a slowdown in the global economy in 1970,\u00a0Manley&#8217;s government enacted various social reforms, such as a higher\u00a0minimum wage, land reform, legislation for women&#8217;s equality, greater housing construction and an increase in educational provision.<br \/>\nThe economic deterioration continued into the mid-1980s, exacerbated by the largest and third-largest alumina producers,\u00a0Alpart\u00a0and\u00a0Alcoa, closed; and there was a significant reduction in production by the second-largest producer,\u00a0Alcan.\u00a0Reynolds Jamaica Mines, Ltd. left the Jamaican industry. There was also a decline in tourism.<br \/>\nDuring this period various economic reforms were introduced, such as deregulating the finance sector and floating the Jamaican dollar, as well as greater investment in infrastructure, whilst also retaining a strong social safety net.\u00a0Political violence, so prevalent in the previous two decades, declined significantly.<br \/>\nIndependence, however widely celebrated in Jamaica, has been questioned in the early 21st century. In 2011, a survey showed that approximately 60% of Jamaicans believe that the country would have been better off had it remained a British colony, with only 17% believing it would have been worse off, citing as problems years of social and fiscal mismanagement in the country.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GEOGRAPHY AND ENVIRONMENT<br \/>\n<\/strong>Mountains dominate the interior: the Don Figuerero, Santa Cruz, and May Day mountains in the west, the\u00a0Dry Harbour Mountains\u00a0in the centre, and the\u00a0John Crow Mountains\u00a0and\u00a0Blue Mountains\u00a0in the east, the latter containing\u00a0Blue Mountain Peak, Jamaica&#8217;s tallest mountain at 2,256 m.\u00a0They are surrounded by a narrow coastal plain.\u00a0Jamaica only has two cities,\u00a0Kingston, the capital city and centre of business, located on the south coast and the second being\u00a0Montego Bay, one of the best known cities in the Caribbean for tourism, located on the north coast.\u00a0Kingston Harbour\u00a0is the seventh-largest natural harbour in the world,\u00a0which contributed to the city being designated as the capital in 1872. Other towns of note include\u00a0Portmore,\u00a0Spanish Town,\u00a0Savanna la Mar,\u00a0Mandeville\u00a0and the resort towns of\u00a0Ocho R\u00edos,\u00a0Port Antonio\u00a0and\u00a0Negril.<br \/>\nTourist attractions include\u00a0Dunn&#8217;s River Falls\u00a0in St. Ann, YS Falls in St. Elizabeth, the Blue Lagoon in\u00a0Portland, believed to be the crater of an extinct volcano, and\u00a0Port Royal, site of a major earthquake in 1692 that helped form the island&#8217;s\u00a0Palisadoes\u00a0tombolo.<br \/>\nAmong the variety of terrestrial, aquatic and marine ecosystems are dry and wet limestone forests, rainforest, riparian woodland, wetlands, caves, rivers, seagrass beds and coral reefs. Among the island&#8217;s protected areas are the\u00a0Cockpit Country,\u00a0Hellshire Hills, and Litchfield forest reserves. In 1992, Jamaica&#8217;s first marine park, covering nearly 15 square kilometres (5.8\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), was established in\u00a0Montego Bay.\u00a0Portland Bight Protected Area\u00a0was designated in 1999.\u00a0The following year\u00a0Blue and John Crow Mountains National Park\u00a0was created, covering roughly 300 square miles (780\u00a0km2) of a wilderness area which supports thousands of tree and fern species and rare animals.<br \/>\nThere are several small islands off Jamaica&#8217;s coast, most notably those in\u00a0Portland Bight\u00a0such as\u00a0Pigeon Island,\u00a0Salt Island,\u00a0Dolphin Island,\u00a0Long Island,\u00a0Great Goat Island\u00a0and\u00a0Little Goat Island, and also\u00a0Lime Cay\u00a0located further east. Much further out \u2013 some 50\u201380\u00a0km off the south coast \u2013 lie the very small\u00a0Morant Cays\u00a0and\u00a0Pedro Cays.<br \/>\n<strong>Climate. <\/strong>The climate is tropical, with hot and humid weather, although higher inland regions are more temperate.\u00a0Some regions on the south coast, such as the Liguanea Plain and the Pedro Plains, are relatively dry\u00a0rain-shadow\u00a0areas.<br \/>\nJamaica lies in the\u00a0hurricane belt\u00a0of the\u00a0Atlantic Ocean\u00a0and because of this, the island sometimes suffers significant storm damage.\u00a0Hurricanes\u00a0Charlie\u00a0and\u00a0Gilbert\u00a0hit Jamaica directly in 1951 and 1988, respectively, causing major damage and many deaths. In the 2000s (decade), hurricanes\u00a0Ivan,\u00a0Dean, and\u00a0Gustav\u00a0also brought severe weather to the island.<br \/>\n<strong>Flora and fauna.<\/strong> Its plant life has changed considerably over the centuries; when the Spanish arrived in 1494, except for small agricultural clearings, the country was deeply forested. The European settlers cut down the great timber trees for building and ships&#8217; supplies, and cleared the plains, savannas, and mountain slopes for intense agricultural cultivation.\u00a0Many new plants were introduced including sugarcane, bananas, and citrus trees.<br \/>\nJamaica is home to about 3,000 species of\u00a0native flowering plants.\u00a0Areas of heavy rainfall contain stands of bamboo, ferns, ebony, mahogany, and rosewood. Cactus and similar dry-area plants are found along the south and southwest coastal area. Parts of the west and southwest consist of large grasslands, with scattered stands of trees. Jamaica is home to three terrestrial\u00a0ecoregions, the\u00a0Jamaican moist forests,\u00a0Jamaican dry forests, and\u00a0Greater Antilles mangroves. It had a 2019\u00a0Forest Landscape Integrity Index ranked it 110th globally out of 172 countries.<br \/>\nJamaica&#8217;s fauna includes bats\u00a0of which at least three endemic species are found only in Cockpit Country. The only non-bat native mammal extant in Jamaica is the\u00a0Jamaican hutia, locally known as the coney.\u00a0Introduced mammals such as\u00a0wild boar\u00a0and the\u00a0small Asian mongoose\u00a0are also common. Jamaica is also home to about 50 species of reptiles,\u00a0the largest of which is the\u00a0American crocodile; however, it is only present within the Black River and a few other areas. Lizards such as\u00a0anoles,\u00a0iguanas\u00a0and snakes such as racers and the\u00a0Jamaican boa\u00a0(the largest snake on the island), are common in areas such as the Cockpit Country. None of Jamaica&#8217;s eight species of native snakes is venomous.<br \/>\nCoral reef ecosystems are important because they provide people with a source of livelihood, food, recreation, and medicinal compounds and protect the land on which they live.\u00a0Jamaica relies on the ocean and its ecosystem for its development. However, the marine life in Jamaica is also being affected. Jamaica&#8217;s geological origin, topographical features and seasonal high rainfall make it susceptible to storm surge, slope failures (landslides), earthquakes, floods and hurricanes.\u00a0Coral reefs in the Negril Marine Park (NMP), Jamaica, have been increasingly impacted by\u00a0nutrient pollution\u00a0and macroalgal blooms following decades of intensive development as a major tourist destination.\u00a0Another one of those factors could include tourism: being that Jamaica is a very touristy place, the island draws numerous people traveling here from all over the world. The Jamaican tourism industry accounts for 32% of total employment and 36% of the country&#8217;s GDP and is largely based on the sun, sea and sand, the last two of these attributes being dependent on healthy coral reef ecosystems.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DEMOGRAPHICS <\/strong><br \/>\nBlack or Black Mixed 92.1%, Mixed non-Black 6.1%, Asian .8%.<br \/>\nAfrican or partially African descent trace their origins to the West African countries of\u00a0Ghana\u00a0and\u00a0Nigeria. It is uncommon for Jamaicans to identify themselves by race as is prominent in other countries such as the United States, with most Jamaicans seeing Jamaican nationality as an identity in and of itself, identifying as simply being &#8220;Jamaican&#8221; regardless of ethnicity.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Jamaican Maroons\u00a0of Accompong and other settlements are the descendants of African slaves who fled the plantations for the interior where they set up their own autonomous communities.\u00a0Many Maroons continue to have their own traditions and speak their own language, known locally as\u00a0Kromanti.<br \/>\nAsians form the second-largest group and include Indo-Jamaicans and Chinese Jamaicans.\u00a0Most are descended from indentured workers brought by the British colonial government to fill labour shortages following the abolition of slavery in 1838.<br \/>\nThere are about 20,000 Jamaicans who have\u00a0Lebanese\u00a0and\u00a0Syrian\u00a0ancestry.\u00a0Most were Christian immigrants who fled the\u00a0Ottoman\u00a0occupation of Lebanon in the early 19th century. Eventually their descendants became very successful politicians and businessmen.<br \/>\nIn 1835,\u00a0Charles Ellis, 1st Baron Seaford\u00a0gave 500 acres of his 10,000 acre estate in Westmoreland for the Seaford Town German settlement. Today most of the town&#8217;s descendants are of full or partial German descent.<br \/>\nThe first wave of\u00a0English\u00a0immigrants arrived to the island 1655 after conquering the Spanish. Jamaica has more people using the Campbell surnames than the population of\u00a0Scotland\u00a0itself, and it also has the highest percentage of Scottish surnames outside of Scotland. Scottish surnames account to about 60% of the surnames in the Jamaican phone books.<br \/>\n<strong>Languages.<\/strong> Jamaica is regarded as a\u00a0bilingual\u00a0country, with two major languages in use by the population. The official language is\u00a0English, which is &#8220;used in all domains of public life&#8221;, including the government, the legal system, the media, and education. However, the primary spoken language is an\u00a0English-based creole\u00a0called\u00a0Jamaican Patois\u00a0(or Patwa). &#8220;Pure&#8221; Patois, though sometimes seen as merely a particularly aberrant dialect of English, is essentially mutually unintelligible with standard English and is best thought of a separate language.<br \/>\n<strong>Emigration.<\/strong> Many Jamaicans have\u00a0emigrated\u00a0to other countries, especially to the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada. In 2004 that up to 2.5 million Jamaicans and Jamaican descendants live abroad.<br \/>\nJamaicans in the United Kingdom\u00a0number an estimated 800,000 making them by far the country&#8217;s largest\u00a0African-Caribbean group. Large-scale migration from Jamaica to the UK occurred primarily in the 1950s and 1960s when the country was still under British rule. Jamaican communities exist in most large UK cities.\u00a0Concentrations of\u00a0expatriate\u00a0Jamaicans are quite considerable in numerous cities in the United States, including\u00a0New York City,\u00a0Buffalo, the\u00a0Miami\u00a0metro area,\u00a0Atlanta,\u00a0Chicago,\u00a0Orlando,\u00a0Tampa,\u00a0Washington, D.C.,\u00a0Philadelphia,\u00a0Hartford,\u00a0Providence\u00a0and\u00a0Los Angeles.\u00a0In Canada, the Jamaican population is centred in\u00a0Toronto,\u00a0with smaller communities in cities such as\u00a0Hamilton,\u00a0Montreal,\u00a0Winnipeg,\u00a0Vancouver\u00a0and\u00a0Ottawa.\u00a0Jamaican Canadians comprise about 30% of the entire\u00a0Black Canadian\u00a0population.<br \/>\nA notable though much smaller group of emigrants are\u00a0Jamaicans in Ethiopia. These are mostly Rastafarians, in whose theological worldview Africa is the promised land, or &#8220;Zion&#8221;, or more specifically Ethiopia, due to reverence in which former Ethiopian Emperor\u00a0Haile Selassie\u00a0is held.\u00a0Most live in the small town of\u00a0Shashamane\u00a0about 150 miles (240\u00a0km) south of the capital\u00a0Addis Ababa.<br \/>\n<strong>Crime. <\/strong>When Jamaica gained independence in 1962, the murder rate was 3.9 per 100,000 inhabitants, one of the lowest in the world.\u00a0By 2009, the rate was 62 per 100,000 inhabitants, one of the highest in the world.\u00a0Gang violence became a serious problem, with organised crime being centred around\u00a0Jamaican posses\u00a0or &#8220;Yardies&#8221;. Jamaica has had one of the highest murder rates in the world for many years, according to\u00a0UN\u00a0estimates.\u00a0Some areas of Jamaica, particularly poor areas in\u00a0Kingston,\u00a0Montego Bay\u00a0and elsewhere experience high levels of crime and violence.<br \/>\nAfter 2011 the murder rate continued to fall, following the downward trend in 2010, after a strategic programme was launched.\u00a0In 2012, the Ministry of National Security reported a 30 percent decrease in murders.\u00a0Nevertheless, in 2017 murders rose by 22% over the previous year.<br \/>\nMany Jamaicans are hostile towards\u00a0LGBT\u00a0and\u00a0intersex\u00a0people, and mob attacks against gay people have been reported.\u00a0Numerous high-profile dancehall and\u00a0ragga\u00a0artists have produced songs featuring explicitly homophobic lyrics.\u00a0Male homosexuality is\u00a0illegal\u00a0and punishable by imprisonment.<br \/>\n<strong>Religion.<\/strong> Christianity\u00a0is the largest religion practised in Jamaica.\u00a0About 70% are\u00a0Protestants;\u00a0Roman Catholics\u00a0are just 2% of the population.<br \/>\nThe Rastafari movement has 29,026 adherents. The faith originated in Jamaica in the 1930s and though rooted in Christianity it is heavily Afrocentric in its focus, revering figures such as the Jamaican black nationalist\u00a0Marcus Garvey\u00a0and\u00a0Haile Selassie, the former Emperor of Ethiopia.\u00a0Rastafari has since spread across the globe, especially to areas with large black or African diasporas.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CULTURE<br \/>\n<\/strong>Though a small nation, Jamaican culture has a strong global presence. The musical genres\u00a0reggae,\u00a0ska,\u00a0mento,\u00a0rocksteady,\u00a0dub, and, more recently, dancehall and\u00a0ragga\u00a0all originated in the island&#8217;s vibrant, popular urban recording industry.\u00a0These have themselves gone on to influence numerous other genres, such as\u00a0punk rock\u00a0(through reggae and ska),\u00a0dub poetry,\u00a0New Wave,\u00a0two-tone,\u00a0lovers rock,\u00a0reggaeton,\u00a0jungle,\u00a0drum and bass,\u00a0dubstep,\u00a0grime\u00a0and American\u00a0rap\u00a0music.<br \/>\nBob Marley\u00a0is probably the best known Jamaican musician; with his band\u00a0The Wailers\u00a0he had a string of hits in 1960s\u201370s, popularising reggae internationally and going on to sell millions of records.<br \/>\nIan Fleming\u00a0(1908 \u2013 1964), who had a home in Jamaica where he spent considerable time, repeatedly used the island as a setting in his\u00a0James Bond\u00a0novels, including\u00a0Live and Let Die,\u00a0Doctor No, &#8220;For Your Eyes Only&#8221;,\u00a0The Man with the Golden Gun, and\u00a0Octopussy and The Living Daylights.[210]\u00a0In addition, James Bond uses a Jamaica-based cover in\u00a0Casino Royale. So far, the only James Bond film adaptation to have been set in Jamaica is\u00a0Doctor No.<br \/>\n<strong>Cuisine.\u00a0<\/strong>The island is famous for its\u00a0Jamaican jerk spice,\u00a0curries, and\u00a0rice and peas, which is integral to Jamaican cuisine. Jamaica is also home of\u00a0Red Stripe\u00a0beer and\u00a0Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sport.\u00a0<\/strong>Sport is an integral part of national life in Jamaica and the island&#8217;s athletes tend to perform to a standard well above what might ordinarily be expected of such a small country.\u00a0While the most popular local sport is\u00a0cricket, on the international stage Jamaicans have tended to do particularly well at\u00a0track and field athletics.\u00a0Over the past six decades Jamaica has produced dozens of world class sprinters including Olympic and World Champions.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>JAMAICA May 4-7, 2022 I flew from Sao Paulo to Fort Lauderdale (United via Chicago O&#8217;Hare and Washington Dulles, 22 hours, CAD$680, by far the cheapest route) on May 2-3, 2022.
