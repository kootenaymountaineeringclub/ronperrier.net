Beauty abounds with bluffs overlooking pretty harbors, sandy-cliffed beaches and tranquil rocky coves where fish provide the beauty.<br \/>\nThere is no real border, only monuments and signs. Phoning between sides is an international call.\u00a0<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong>Beaches\u00a0and Snorkelling\u00a0are a main attraction.

Sandy was so nice to pick me up on Feb 22 and then drive me to the airport on March 4, return after the cancelled flight and then again on March 5. <\/em><br \/>\n<em>I flew on WestJet from Comox via Vancouver and Toronto to Phillipsburg, Sint Maarten and met Leon at the airport. We took a share taxi ($2) all the way to the cruise port on the south side of the town. <\/em><br \/>\n<em>I had assumed that my positive PCR (Feb 11 in Salvador Brazil) which was good to enter Sint Maarten would be accepted by MSC but they required a negative 48-hour PCR and I was refused boarding. There were other people in the same boat and I went with two women from Belgium in a taxi to find flights to Barbados (the destination of the boat on March 7). There were no obvious flights and we returned to Phillipsburg. They got an expensive hotel and I decided to walk out to the cruise terminal to see if they were any other options. With none, I walked back into town and got a hotel room (Hotel Caribbean $50\/night) for 2 nights. I booked a flight to Dominica on March 8 to meet the boat arriving on March 9. I got a PCR at St Maarten Laboratory on the 7<sup>th<\/sup> but learned it would be over 48 hours old when I arrived in Dominica so did another one on the 8<sup>th<\/sup> ($US 75 per test) on my way to the airport. <\/em><br \/>\n<em>There isn\u2019t anything to do in Sint Maarten and I basically spent 1\u00bd days reading.<\/em><br \/>\n<strong>Yoda Guy Movie Exhibit.<\/strong> In the NM Museums series, this was a dated waste of time. Who cares about a bunch of Star Wars characters now 30 years old. $5<br \/>\n<strong>Sint Maarten Museum<\/strong>. The usual local museum with history, ethnography and archaeology. $3<\/p>\n<p><em>On March 8, I had my PCR and continued by share taxi to a Burger King and the airport to catch my flight to Dominica at 4pm (WinAir $306). It was late and I arrived at the airport at dusk. I didn\u2019t have the required accommodation and booked an Air BnB in about 20kms from the airport. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>On March 13, the boat returned to Sint Maarten. I had rented a car and finally connected with them at 9:30. We drove around the entire island. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>SAINT MARTIN\u00a0<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Maho Bay\u00a0beach\u00a0<\/strong>(Dutch) is at the end of the airport\u2019s runway with large aircraft flying just feet over the beach. Holding on to the fence is not recommended due to flying gravel\u00a0and people have been injured, a very few killed doing.<br \/>\nUnfortunately, the wind direction was such that planes were landing over the beach and not taking off.<br \/>\n<strong>Cupecoy Beach*<\/strong>\u00a0in the far western tip.

Pic du Paradis is the highest point on the island (1400ft\/427m) with two viewing areas that provide great views. One looks down on the French side with views all the way to Philipsburg. The other view is on the other side of a fenced microwave tower and looks down to the north with views from the airport and east. The road is steep but is paved and can be done by any car. Many people walked up from the farm.<br \/>\n<strong>National Nature Reserve.\u00a0<\/strong>Protects the five main ecosystems: coral reefs, mangroves, seed plant herbariums, swamps, and dry coastal forests in 3,000 hectares of marine territory and 150 hectares of land.

Famous Creole Rock, facing Grand Case Bay and the marshlands of Orient Bay\u2019s Fish and Salt Ponds are part.<br \/>\nDive from Creole Rock, or meander about with your snorkel.

Enjoy lunch, swim on a beautiful Beach and watch the airplanes land at Tortuga at Maho.<br \/>\nSave money: 15% may be added to your bill as Tax or SC (Service charge) but the island has no dining tax\u00a0so the restaurant may be taking advantage of North American tourists and is your tip. Water is assumed to be bottled water \u2013 US$4-5 per bottle, more expensive than beer or wine.
