Long not used, it was re-developed by Brian Cross, owner of Carlyle Mountain Backcountry Lodge. What has resulted is a 4 day\/3 nite backcountry adventure. Described as &#8220;glamping&#8221;, accommodation is provided in 2 remote camps and the main lodge. Participants need only carry a daypack. Following either on, or very close to the ridge line, the trip offers views of glaciers in every direction &#8211; Kokanee, Whitewater and Woodbury. Other attractions are wildflowers in season and the brilliant alpine larch display in late September when the larch drop their golden needles.<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>HISTORY<br \/>\n<\/strong>After the California gold rush of the 1849\u2019s, it seemed as though fortune-seeking prospectors had made their way into every nook, cranny and outcrop the American West had to offer. Known as \u201csourdoughs\u201d (seasoned miners that knew a thing or two about bush-craft and DIY baking) many were drawn north when news of significant strikes in British Columbia\u2019s \u201cSilvery Slocan\u201d made their way south of the border in the 1890\u2019s. Americans, Canadians, Swedes, Norwegians, the Chinese and a dozen other nationalities converged on Sandon, Slocan, New Denver and other boom-towns in the region.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Payne Mine, Reco, and a dozen other claims became famous throughout the Western world, but most mines and old sourdoughs were destined to live out their days in relative poverty and anonymity. Today the boom times are a memory, but many of the towns and settlements live on alongside ghosts of cities past; Three Forks and Sandon are gone, as are Comaplix, the Alamo and Zincton, but Kaslo, Silverton, New Denver and others persevere.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The backcountry skiing and snowboarding are endless, as are the sledding, fishing, biking and hiking. The old forgotten track\/path crossing Silver Ridge has been &#8220;rediscovered&#8221; as the Sourdough Traverse, an adventure that pays homage to the amazing history of the &#8220;Silvery Slocan&#8221;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Rating:\u00a0\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u25ca<br \/>\nLocation:<\/strong> Follows the high altitude alpine Silver Ridge between Idaho Peak and Mount Carlyle and then descends on an excellent old miner&#8217;s trail to Cody, just above Sandon.
