Thompson Rim Trail is\u00a0the Creston Valley\u2019s most iconic hike. Its common knowledge that most\u00a0trails offering epic views involve hiking up a mountain. This one breaks the mold by allowing the hikers to do most of the hard work\u00a0in their 4x4s.<\/em><br \/>\n<em>There is no water on the trail.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Location:<\/strong>\u00a0 The ridge that forms the west skyline of the Creston Valley.<br \/>\n<strong>Difficulty:<\/strong> B1<br \/>\n<strong>Elevation Gain:<\/strong> 150m (rolling terrain)<br \/>\n<strong>Distance:<\/strong> 7.4kms round trip<br \/>\n<strong>Time:<\/strong> 5 hours<br \/>\n<strong>Season:<\/strong> July to September<br \/>\n<strong>Access:<\/strong> Copious parking.<br \/>\n<strong>Map:<\/strong> 82F\/2<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nDrive:\u00a0<\/strong>Drive east out of Creston on Hwy 3 and turn south (right) onto Canyon-Lister Rd.\u00a0 Zero odometer.<br \/>\n<strong>0.0km.\u00a0<\/strong>Canyon-Lister Rd.<br \/>\n1.1 km. Turn east (left) on Whimster Rd, go 750 m<br \/>\n1.85km. Continue on Mt Thompson Forestry Rd (gravel, steep grades) for 12 km.\u00a0 Upon arriving at the top of Mt. Thompson you will likely experience mixed feelings, as while the view is stunning, it\u2019s hard to ignore the cellphone and radio towers. Don\u2019t let them get you down, as they\u2019ll be quickly out of view.<br \/>\n14kms. Head past them to the trailhead.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Route\/Trail.<\/strong> The trail descends quickly along the ridge into some truly unreal sections of trail.\u00a0Views are expansive on both sides, stretching from the southern tip of Kootenay Lake to the north, and well past the US border to the south.\u00a0Its as close to an aerial\u00a0view of the Creston Valley as you can find\u00a0without knowing a pilot \u2013 and you didn\u2019t even have to hike up a mountain.<br \/>\nAfter hiking for a couple hours or so you\u2019ll get to the trail end which is another tower. From here you can look down on the Skimmerhorn and get a totally different perspective of the bumps and cliffs along its ridgeline. Going back is no easier or harder than the first half of the hike, but its a trail where one appreciates equally impressive views going both ways so the trip back is just awesome.<\/p>\n<p><strong>References:<\/strong><br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/crestoncommunityforest.com\/thompson-rim-trail\/\">http:\/\/crestoncommunityforest.com\/thompson-rim-trail\/<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Mt.
