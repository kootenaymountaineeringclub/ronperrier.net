Some of these earliest Breton pioneers settled along the rugged coast of Pembrokeshire in Wales. It may have been their descendants, some 40 generations later, who built the first edition of Stonehenge.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"ngm-section-2\">\n<p class=\"ngm-section-text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span class=\"ngm-dropcap-2\">A<\/span><span class=\"ngm-section-boldPhrase\">RCHAEOLOGISTS<\/span>\u00a0know to look to Wales for the start of the story primarily because of a sharp-eyed geologist named Herbert Thomas. Think of Stonehenge and you\u2019ll almost certainly envision its huge sarsen trilithons. But another, much smaller, type of monolith huddles within the horseshoe of trilithons\u2014the bluestones. Unlike the sarsens, which are made of local silica-rich stone, the bluestones are entirely alien to the landscape. There are no rock types like them anywhere near Stonehenge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The bluestone monoliths weigh an average of two tons each. Where they came from, and how they came to be arranged in a ring in the middle of Salisbury Plain, was already a centuries-old mystery when Thomas was shown a sampling of them in 1923. Among the pieces was a type of bluestone called spotted dolerite, and he recalled seeing outcrops of that same rock many years earlier while hiking in the Preseli Hills, a wild moorland in Pembrokeshire some 175 miles from Stonehenge. After further examination, Thomas narrowed down the source of the bluestone to rocky outcrops called Carn Meini.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"ngm-2207-stonehenge-interactive-story_stonehenge-graphic\" class=\"ng-graphic-wrap\">\n<div id=\"g-ngm-2207-stonehenge-interactive-story_stonehenge-graphic_ai2html-box\" class=\"ai2html\">\n<div id=\"g-ngm-2207-stonehenge-interactive-story_stonehenge-graphic_ai2html-medium\" class=\"g-artboard\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.507\" data-min-width=\"960\">\n<div><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"g-ngm-2207-stonehenge-interactive-story_stonehenge-graphic_ai2html-medium-img\" class=\"g-aiImg\" src=\"https:\/\/interactives.natgeofe.com\/high-touch\/ngm-2207-stonehenge-interactive-story\/builds\/main\/ngm-assets\/img\/ngm-2207-stonehenge-interactive-story_stonehenge-graphic_ai2html-medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https:\/\/interactives.natgeofe.com\/high-touch\/ngm-2207-stonehenge-interactive-story\/builds\/main\/ngm-assets\/img\/ngm-2207-stonehenge-interactive-story_stonehenge-graphic_ai2html-medium.jpg\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"g-ai0-1\" class=\"g-MAP g-aiAbs\">\n<p class=\"g-pstyle0\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Stonehenge, the most complex and famous stone circle in the British Isles, is just one of about 1,300 of these prehistoric monuments.

One stone in particular\u2014number 62 in the nomenclature of Stonehenge archaeologists\u2014could possibly be traced directly to Waun Mawn. The claim, which aired on a British TV special, created a stir in the press and divided archaeologists. Some were skeptical that Waun Mawn was a stone circle at all, but merely a few isolated stones. And so Parker Pearson returned to Waun Mawn to firm up his theory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ngm-section-text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The evidence is certainly tantalizing. Stone 62 is one of only three bluestones at Stonehenge made of non-spotted dolerite, the type of stone used to build Waun Mawn. Moreover, stone 62 has a peculiar pentagonal cross section that appears to match the imprint left by one of the stones that were removed from the ancient Welsh circle.

Aligned on the axis of the summer solstice sunrise and the winter solstice sunset, the prehistoric stone circle has long been a place of seasonal celebrations. Stonehenge visitor Hanna Lingard greets the sun as a chilly dawn breaks on the morning of the autumn equinox. To protect the fabled monument from damage, most visitors are not allowed near the stones. But solstice and equinox are open-house occasions, and celebrants relish the opportunity to venture inside the stone circle.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A woman holds a crystal at sunrise over Stonehenge on the first morning of autumn, September 23, 2021, during equinox celebrations at the site.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"ngm-img-wrap-11\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"ngm-image\" src=\"https:\/\/interactives.natgeofe.com\/high-touch\/ngm-2207-stonehenge-interactive-story\/builds\/main\/ngm-assets\/img\/lg\/section3\/image11.jpg\" alt=\"Photograph by Alice Zoo.\" data-src=\"https:\/\/interactives.natgeofe.com\/high-touch\/ngm-2207-stonehenge-interactive-story\/builds\/main\/ngm-assets\/img\/sm\/section3\/image11.jpg\" data-src-900=\"https:\/\/interactives.natgeofe.com\/high-touch\/ngm-2207-stonehenge-interactive-story\/builds\/main\/ngm-assets\/img\/lg\/section3\/image11.jpg\" \/><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Some stones have been patched, others leave nooks for people, such as this napper on the autumn equinox, to commune closely with the site.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">On the evening before the autumn equinox, a crowd of Druids, pagans, and pilgrims gathers to chant and celebrate the change of seasons. Says Druid Arthur Pendragon, \u201cStonehenge is at once a great solar clock, a pagan temple, a sacred burial site, and a place of Druid reverence and ceremony.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As for the creators of Stonehenge, the Durrington pits, and countless other monuments, one can\u2019t help but think they would have loved the tunnel idea, given the havoc they wreaked on their surroundings by their building binge. Britain\u2019s ancient forests bore the brunt of it, not only in the thousands of huge oak trees felled to build those enormous palisades but also in the thousands more needed to erect Stonehenge and other megaliths. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize the vast amount of timber that would have been required,\u201d Pitts says.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"ngm-section-text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In the case of Stonehenge, transporting dozens of huge sarsen blocks weighing on average 20 tons each for 15 miles and then erecting them on-site would have required great wooden sleds, an enormous amount of scaffolding, and possibly miles of wooden tracks over which the heavily burdened sleds could be dragged. (Contrary to popular myth, the one method they didn\u2019t use was rollers. \u201cRollers just don\u2019t work,\u201d says Pitts, citing evidence from many experiments. \u201cThey jam up constantly.\u201d)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ngm-section-text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Whatever the means of transport, the movement of the massive stones across the landscape likely attracted crowds of festive onlookers. \u201cIt would have been like watching the space shuttle go by,\u201d Pitts says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ngm-section-text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span class=\"ngm-dropcap-2\">A<\/span><span class=\"ngm-section-boldPhrase\">S IMPRESSIVE<\/span> as Stonehenge is, you need to drive another 20 miles to the north to the mega-henge at Avebury to grasp the sheer scale and diversity of the building boom. While Stonehenge has global name recognition and those famous sarsen trilithons, Avebury, as the 17th-century antiquarian John Aubrey put it, \u201cdoes as much exceed in greatness the so-renowned Stonehenge [sic], as a Cathedral doeth a parish church.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"ngm-section-4\">\n<p class=\"ngm-section-text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Avebury henge is almost a mile in circumference, so large that nearly its entire namesake village\u2014including a pub, thatched cottages, and pastures dotted with sheep\u2014fits comfortably in its embrace. The stone circle within it, at more than a thousand feet in diameter, is the largest in the world. Two more circles lie inside that, and a grand avenue of standing stones leads away from it, stretching a mile and a half across the countryside to an outlying stone and timber circle. And for good measure, the eerie mass of Silbury Hill, composed of 500,000 tons of soil and the largest human-made mound in prehistoric Europe, is only a 20-minute walk away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ngm-section-text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Hidden beneath this sleepy patch of bottomland along the River Kennet, just a mile or so downstream from Avebury, lies what<a class=\"ngm-text-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.southampton.ac.uk\/people\/5x82f6\/professor-josh-pollard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u00a0Josh Pollard<\/a>, a professor of archaeology at the University of Southampton, refers to as the \u201csleeping giants\u201d of the Avebury landscape: a series of wooden palisades that were built from the trunks of more than 4,000 ancient oaks. During excavations last summer, Pollard and his team discovered yet another timber enclosure, some 300 feet in diameter, and within it the footings of an enormous rectangular great house more than a hundred feet long, with walls made of gigantic timbers towering as much as 40 feet above the ground. \u201cThis would have been a truly astonishing sight,\u201d Pollard says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ngm-section-text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Yet for all Avebury\u2019s grandeur, and that of the other monuments nearby, it\u2019s the River Kennet, flowing through the sleepy Wiltshire countryside a few hundred yards away, that Pollard believes to be the key to understanding the minds of the Neolithic people who built all these things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ngm-section-text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cI think the river was more important to them than the monuments they built along it,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can see it in the creation of Silbury at its source, and in the river\u2019s relationship to the palisades. It has a connecting role with the monuments here just as the River Avon does with the monuments in the Stonehenge landscape.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ngm-section-text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">By the dawn of the 25th century B.C., the people of Britain surely must have been aware of the momentous technological changes unfolding on the Continent with the development of metalworking. They already may have been using copper tools acquired by trade.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ngm-section-text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine something like the Avebury palisades being made without copper tools,\u201d says Pollard, adding that any such tools would almost certainly have been reused and recycled many times over during the centuries that followed, making it unlikely that any will be unearthed at Neolithic building sites.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"ngm-section-5\">\n<p class=\"ngm-section-text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span class=\"ngm-dropcap-2\">W<\/span><span class=\"ngm-section-boldPhrase\">HAT SPARKED<\/span>\u00a0the extraordinary building boom, and how and why it came to an end, remain unsolved mysteries. But archaeologists note an intriguing connection in time with the rise of the Bronze Age, which arrived in Britain by way of another mass migration from the Continent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ngm-section-text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cThe dates are awfully close,\u201d says English Heritage\u2019s Susan Greaney. \u201cWas this splurge in monument building a reaction to the changes they knew were coming? Did they sense this was the end of the era? Or could it have been the monument building itself that caused a collapse in the society or its belief system that left a vacuum that others came to fill? Was there some kind of a rebellion against an authority that was ordering all this unsustainable construction?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ngm-section-text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A more chilling possibility is that a pandemic may have played a role. Scientists have found plague bacillus in a Neolithic tomb in Sweden, and earlier this year it was identified in a Bronze Age grave in Somerset. The ancient variety doesn\u2019t appear to be as virulent as the one that swept Europe in the 14th century, but there\u2019s no telling what its effects might have been on Britain\u2019s Neolithic people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ngm-section-text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cIt could be that unbeknownst to them, the diaspora who were on the move at the dawn of the Bronze Age were spreading an epidemic, wiping out populations and opening up new areas for people to move into,\u201d says the University of York\u2019s Jim Leary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ngm-section-text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">One way or another, within a century of Stonehenge\u2019s completion, waves of genetically distinct settlers once again were coming over from the Continent. History was repeating itself a hundred generations later, except this time the newcomers\u2019 ancestry stretched back thousands of years to the Eurasian steppes instead of to Anatolia. The so-called Beaker people brought new beliefs, new ideas, their distinctive beaker-shaped pottery, and metallurgical skills that would define the coming age.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ngm-section-text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Neolithic farmers who built Stonehenge and scores of other monuments faded into history, their DNA all but vanishing from Britain\u2019s gene pool. The landscape around Stonehenge would continue to be an important burial site, but the era of mega-monuments was over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ngm-section-text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cMonument building is usually a kind of peak of a civilization,\u201d Leary says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think this was the peak of a civilization. I think it was the mad, manic, final throw of the dice of a society that knows its time is up.\u201d<br \/>\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"FITT_Article_main  \">\n<div class=\"dHdHP jLREf zXXje aGO eCClZ nTLv jLsYA gmuro TOSFd VmeZt sCkVm hkQai wGrlE MUuGM fciaN qQjt DhNVo Tgcqk IGLAf tWjkv \">\n<div class=\"PrismArticleBody SingleColumn xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES \" data-testid=\"prism-article-body\">\n<div class=\"FITT_Article_main_group_wrapper VZTD UeCOM jIRH oimqG DjbQm UwdmX Xmrlz ReShI KaJdY lqtkC ssImf HfYhe RTHNs iJVrZ \" data-testid=\"prism-GridContainer\">\n<div class=\"Kiog kNVGM nvpSA qwdi bmjsw \" data-testid=\"prism-GridRow\">\n<div class=\"theme-e oBTii mrzah \" data-testid=\"prism-GridColumn\">\n<h2 class=\"RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK \">The origins of Stonehenge\u2019s \u2018altar\u2019<\/h2>\n<p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">The Neolithic monument of Stonehenge in the southwest of England first rose to\u00a0<a class=\"zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE \" href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/premium\/article\/magic-merlin-wizard-camelot\" data-testid=\"prism-linkbase\">fame in the Middle Ages<\/a>, but new techniques are revealing more details about its construction.
