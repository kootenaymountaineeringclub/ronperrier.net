Almost wherever he speaks, he risks a clamour of boos and jeers, many from members of his own party, the African National Congress (ANC). A rally organised by the country\u2019s main trade union federation, which is formally allied with the ANC, should have been a perfect opportunity for him to drone on about the party\u2019s achievements since ending white-minority rule in 1994. But he never got the chance to speak; union members shouted him down. Two of his closest supporters were also heckled at May Day rallies in different cities on the same day. Unionised workers, who in past elections made up most of the activists going door-to-door to canvas for the ANC, are turning against a tainted president, and against a party that excuses his many scandals.<\/p>\n<p>Mr Zuma\u2019s second and final term of office still has two years to run. Yet the race to succeed him is already on. A lot rests on this transition. It could determine whether the country\u2019s democratic institutions are revived, or whether South Africa descends further into a swamp of corruption and stagnation. \u201cThey are demanding bribes to get anything done,\u201d laments one businessman, adding that it was not nearly as bad under previous ANC presidents.<\/p>\n<p>Many people assume that the ANC will win a majority of the national vote in 2019 and that the party leader will therefore be the next president. That party leader will be picked at a congress in December. Mr Zuma hopes to anoint a successor who will shield him from the 783 charges of fraud, corruption and racketeering he faces, which predate his presidency. He is backing his ex-wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, a former head of the African Union.<br \/>\nHer main opponent is Cyril Ramaphosa, Mr Zuma\u2019s deputy and a former trade-union boss turned tycoon (the two are pictured either side of Mr Zuma). Mr Ramaphosa is capable and rails against corruption. He has backed a call by Thuli Madonsela, a former public protector, for a judicial inquiry into allegations that Mr Zuma\u2019s rich friends have unduly influenced cabinet appointments and state contracts. Pravin Gordhan, a popular finance minister fired by Mr Zuma, has spoken in favour of Mr Ramaphosa. So too have both of the ANC\u2019s allies, the South African Communist Party and the Congress of South African Trade Unions.<\/p>\n<p>That said, Mr Ramaphosa may not win over enough delegates at the party congress. Many have benefited from the looting of state resources that has proliferated during Mr Zuma\u2019s presidency. Mr Ramaphosa has complained about car boots full of cash being used to buy support. A survey by Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) predicts that Ms Dlamini-Zuma will be the next leader of the ANC.<\/p>\n<p>However, it is not only ANC grandees who will vote. So, in the general election, will ordinary South Africans. Some party members fear that in 2019, for the first time, Africa\u2019s oldest liberation movement will fail to win a majority. The party, which won 62% of the vote in 2014, has lost its lustre under Mr Zuma.<\/p>\n<p>Last year it lost power in several of South Africa\u2019s biggest cities. Municipal IQ, a research firm that has analysed the results of local elections in 2011 and 2016, when support for the ANC slumped from 62% to 54%, reckons it could fall below 50% nationally in 2019. RMB\u2019s survey found a \u201cmeaningful probability\u201d that the ANC would lose power.<br \/>\nMany in the ANC are nervous. Discussion documents released ahead of a party policy conference that will be held from late June fret about \u201cinternal squabbles, money politics, corruption and poor performance in government\u201d, and even \u201cthe hollowing out of the capacity of the democratic state\u201d. Zweli Mkhize, the ANC\u2019s treasurer, accepts that the ANC \u201cneeds to put its house in order\u201d. However Mr Mkhize, like many other senior figures in the ANC, is unwilling to criticise Mr Zuma openly.<\/p>\n<p>He\u2019s still the boss<br \/>\nThis deference is partly due to tradition\u2014during the ANC\u2019s many years in exile, internal dissent was stifled\u2014but also because potential rebels are afraid. Mr Zuma wields immense formal powers. As president, he can sack cabinet ministers. And Mr Zuma remains the boss of the ANC, which can kick MPs out of parliament by expelling them from the party if they break ranks on a big vote.<\/p>\n<p>However, a case before the Constitutional Court may weaken Mr Zuma\u2019s hold. Opposition parties have asked the court to allow MPs to cast secret votes in a motion of no-confidence. Mr Zuma has already survived four no-confidence votes and two motions for impeachment because of his iron grip on the party. But secrecy might make ANC MPs braver. And only a quarter of them would have to side with the opposition to kick Mr Zuma out.<\/p>\n<p>However, even if Mr Zuma and his cronies are on their way out, they can still do enormous harm. Take the case of Brian Molefe, who just a few months ago was forced to resign as head of Eskom, the state-owned electricity monopoly, after the public protector found he had a \u201ccosy relationship\u201d with pals of the president who had won big contracts from the utility. This week he was reappointed to the post to push through Mr Zuma\u2019s plan to spend as much as 1trn rand ($76bn) on Russian nuclear power plants that will not help at all with South Africa\u2019s immediate energy needs. \u201cThe ANC is simply incapable of reforming itself,\u201d says Mzukisi Qobo of the University of Johannesburg, a co-author of \u201cThe Fall of the ANC: What Next?\u201d \u201cWe are in for a rough ride.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>ANC &#038; CORRUPTION In the twilight of his unpopular presidency, Jacob Zuma has to vet his crowds carefully.
