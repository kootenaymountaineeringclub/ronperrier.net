Despite being adjacent to\u00a0Saudi Arabia\u00a0and on the same peninsula as the\u00a0United Arab Emirates, Yemen is definitely a place apart.<br \/>\nAs of February 2020, it is not possible to travel as an independent tourist to Yemen. Obtaining a tourist visa is very difficult without a tour operator. Given the limited tourism infrastructure, you can\u2019t travel independently to many destinations. The only option is to have a driver and guide take you around. Travel permits are necessary for almost everywhere. You have to pass through many checkpoints and you are only allowed in certain regions that are deemed safe for foreigners.<br \/>\nForeigners are not allowed to visit too many places. The only parts of the country that can be visited as a tourist are the island of Socotra and the eastern part of the Yemeni mainland (Hadramout governorate). It is not possible to visit Aden and Western part of Yemen.<br \/>\nYou are generally not allowed to use public transportation. The guards will not let you through the checkpoints if you are on a bus. You need to have a licensed driver who can obtain the necessary permits for you to travel to parts of the country so this is not the kind of country where you can simply travel around by bus unfortunately.<br \/>\nRequire double entry Yemen visa (e-visa).<br \/>\nHotel in Salalah: Al Dyafa, 214 Central Ave, Salalah<\/p>\n<p><strong>Capital:<\/strong> Sana\u2019a<br \/>\n<strong>Currency:<\/strong> Yemeni rial (YER). Banknotes circulate in denominations of 50, 100, 200, 250, 500 and 1000 rials, and you are also likely to come across 10 and 20 coins. The rial is freely convertible and subject to frequent fluctuations.<br \/>\n<strong>Population:<\/strong> 26.1 million<br \/>\n<strong>Language:<\/strong> Arabic. Independent visitors need some Arabic if traveling outside the capital as the bilingual signs common throughout most of the Middle East are commonly absent.<br \/>\n<strong>Country code:<\/strong> +967<\/p>\n<p><strong>GET IN<br \/>\nVISA.<\/strong> Visa regulations change quite regularly, and an embassy should be contacted to make certain that the relevant documentation is obtained (it is recommended also to ask one of the licensed tour operators in Sana\u2019a). Citizens of most countries must obtain visas in advance. The easiest way to get the visa is directly from Embassy of Yemen in your home country. Most visas are valid for 30 days from the date of issue (3 months for European Union).<br \/>\nAnother way of getting visa is via one of the licensed tour operators, as they are allowed to prepare pre-visa paper in the Ministry of Foreign affairs on the mainland or Socotra Island for a visa on arrival. Require a colour copy of passport and a personal photo (passport size). Takes 5-7 working days. Such pre-visa paper is valid for 30 days from the day of issue and upon this a real visa is issued at the Sana\u2019a or Socotra airport.<br \/>\nNote that require an Oman one year multiple entry visa &#8211; easy to get online for 50 OMR. It took 2-7 days to process.<br \/>\n<strong>By plane.<\/strong> As of fall 2018, most flights to Yemen are suspended due to the official no-fly zone. Yemenia\u00a0runs a skeleton service based in\u00a0Aden\u00a0with flights from Amman, Cairo, and Riyadh. Other airports are either closed permanently or operates only infrequently.<br \/>\nSocotra. Yememia Airways has a flight from Cairo to Socotra Island once a week (every Wednesday).<br \/>\n<strong>By car.<\/strong> East Yemen. Flights from Cairo to Salalah, Oman \u2013 cross Yemen-Oman border by car. Crossing from\u00a0Saudi Arabia\u00a0in a car is substantially more difficult, as regulations for getting a car into Saudi are very intricate.<br \/>\n<strong>By train.<\/strong>\u00a0There are no trains to or within Yemen.<br \/>\n<strong>By bus.<\/strong>\u00a0Some buses operating throughout the Arabian peninsula connect to Yemen. Tourists (especially from non-Arab countries) are not allowed to use public transport on roads linking the East and the West of Yemen:\u00a0Mukallah\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Aden\u00a0and\u00a0Say\u2019un\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sana\u2019a. If flights exist, tourists have to take a plane to come from the west to the eastern part of the country. Buses from\u00a0Salalah, Oman go\u00a0to\u00a0Sayu\u2019n\u00a0in\u00a0Wadi Hadramawt\u00a0and\u00a0Mukallah\u00a0on the Indian Ocean.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TOURS<\/strong> &#8211; Eastern Yemen &#8211; Hadramout governorate. There are several tour operators. The two main ones offering trips to Shibam and Wadi Dawan in February 2020 seemed to be these two. Both included: pick up at the airport in Salalah and driving back, car and driver, accommodation, food and drinks, visa to Yemen, tour guide.\u00a0The best itineraries divide day one and five into two days each &#8211; 750km and 675kms and make it a 7-day trip.<br \/>\n1.

Apparently Abdul&#8217;s brother runs part of the trip &#8211; he has lots of issues and abandoned a woman with 2 days left in her trip. The only positive reviews on Trip Advisor were from one traveler whose only TA reviews were these two and occurred immediately after the bad reviews. Their 5 day itinerary does not make sense as Day 1 and 5 are both incredibly long drives from Salalah, Oman to Seijun.<br \/>\n2.

This is not a tour company.<br \/>\nTheir main activity is an 8-day trip to Socotra Island involving a trek $3900 Oct 20-29, 2020 and again in February 2021. They offer an &#8220;add-on&#8221; trip to the Yemen mainland in the east $2200 Oct 15-21 and again preceding their Socotra trip. It sounds identical to the trip offered by Kais.<br \/>\n<strong>Itinerary in East Yemen<\/strong><br \/>\n<em>Day 1, 2<\/em>: Salalah, Oman &#8211; Seiyun, Yemen. Salalah, Oman, cross border, Al Ghardha, overnight in Shihan. 220kms on day one. Day two is 550kms on broken road, long drive to Seiyun.<br \/>\n<em>Day 3:<\/em> Seiyun \u2013 Tarim \u2013 Shibam \u2013 Seiyun. From Seiyun drive to Tarim &#8211; built before Islamic era. From Tarim driver to Shibam. On the top of the mountain we will watch the beautiful sunset. In the evening time we will go around Shibam and then drive back to Seiyun. Only 25kms between towns. Overnight in Seiyun.<br \/>\n<em>Day 4:<\/em> Seiyun \u2013 Wadi Dawan \u2013 Al-Hajjarein \u2013 Saif \u2013 Beit Bukshan. From Seiyun drive to Wadi Dawan \u2013 one of the largest southern valleys full of date palms and small villages on both side of rivers. Al-Hajjarein City located in the wadi built before Islamic era and at this time with many beautiful mosques. Then drive to Saif \u2013 small village in the middle of Wadi Dawan. In the evening arrival in Beit Bukshan. Overnight in Beit Bukshan or Al Mukalla. 350kms\u00a0 Al \u2013 Khoreiba &#8211; village with beautiful architecture.<br \/>\n<em>Day 5,6:<\/em>\u00a0Al Mukalla to Surfeet. 675kms<br \/>\nDay 7. After breakfast drive to Salalah (Oman).<\/p>\n<p><strong>GET AROUND<\/strong><br \/>\nIndependent travel is possible in Socotra and to Hauf (just barely past the Oman border) in east Yemen. Before the travel restrictions, the local transport (taxis, buses, aircraft) was perfect to get around on the cheap. More intrepid travellers could take advantage of the local intercity bus service, which was comfortable, and a wonderful way to see the country. The buses usually took a pit stop every hour or so, making this a slower but much more interesting way to travel for those who are up for an adventure and some friendly conversation. The biggest company in Yemen is Yemitco, their offices can be found in major cities. Now it is not possible to travel past Hauf by bus.<br \/>\nMore expensive, but now the only real way to see much of the country, and a more efficient travel is to book your tour via one of the registered tour operators, that are found on the\u00a0Yemen Ministry of Tourism webpage. Be aware that there are many non-registered tour operators in Yemen. For trips outside the capital, many travellers prefer a car (preferably 4WD) and may choose to hire a driver through a local travel agency.<br \/>\nFor trips outside Sana\u2019a, however, a 4-wheel-drive is almost mandatory as most roads away from the routes connecting main cities are not paved. Travellers should also give serious consideration to hiring a local driver\/guide, as maps tend not to be as useful as they can be in other countries. A city limits border pass is required as only the cities are well protected by the military. It is also worth noting that Yemen has one of the largest populations of armed civilians outside of\u00a0Texas\u00a0so be polite.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GEOGRAPHY<br \/>\n<\/strong>Central Plateau. From the Yemeni mountains and highlands of the west, the land descends slowly eastwards and eventually levels off at the Central Plateau with an elevation of 915-1,525 m (3,000-5,000 ft). The plateau is bisected by valleys and wadis, or streams. This terrain is not as rough as the central or western highlands, but vegetation is only possible in the valleys or near wadis, for they provide a lot of irrigation water from precipitation that only occurs in the remote areas. Flash floods are very common. This extends from Shabwah though Hadhramaut and Al Mahra, continuing into Dhofar in Oman, which also revered by many Yemenis as part of Greater Yemen, not to mention also Najran, Jizan, and Asir in Saudi Arabia.<br \/>\n<strong>Desert:<\/strong>\u00a0Rub Al-Khali, aka the Empty Quarter, the most treacherous desert in the world, and also the largest expanse of sand in the world, is in northeastern Yemen, southeastern Saudi Arabia, and northwestern Oman. It receives no rain at all for periods of years, and little to no vegetation exists. Temperature can reach 61\u00b0C (142\u00b0F).<\/p>\n<p><strong>SEE \u2013 <\/strong>Hadhramaut<br \/>\n<strong>Hauf National Park:<\/strong>\u00a0The only natural forest in the Arabian Peninsula due to the seasonal monsoon rains that also affect India.

Hundreds of adobe homes ranging from 5-11 storeys high are boxed into a walled area that is simply marvellous. The tops are painted with gypsum, a mineral commonly found in Yemen. Some of the buildings are over 700 years old.<br \/>\n<strong>Tarim and Say\u2019un:<\/strong>\u00a0These nearby towns are made almost entirely of adobe.
