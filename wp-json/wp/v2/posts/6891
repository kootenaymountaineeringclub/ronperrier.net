The first recreational use of the trail began in the 1930s when the only way into the original hot springs was by foot or horse up this trail.<br \/>\nThis is a good mountain bike trip.

From the junction of Hwy 6 and 23 in Nakusp, travel east on Highway 6 towards New Denver for 2km. Turn left onto Alexander Road at Carson&#8217;s Corner Store. Follow this road for 2.3km. Turn right at a brown 4&#215;4 post with white lettering, signed Kuskanax Cr Trail. Follow this rough, 2-WD dirt road for 1.4 km to a fork. Go right for 1km suitable for 4WD vehicles only. If parking your vehicle here, be sure to leave room for others to park, pass or turn around. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Alternate access is from Nakusp Hot Springs. Park in the parking lot for the Nakusp Hot Springs pools. Walk up the road that continues past the pool parking lot, Shortly you will cross Kuskanax Creek on a suspension bridge. One across the bridge, follow the sign marked &#8220;To Springs&#8221;. Within 200m the trail will fork, take the right fork, signed &#8220;To Town&#8221;.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Trail:<\/strong> The trail begins on the edge of an old clearcut. In the spring and early summer, the daisies and fireweed put on quite a show. As you enter the forest, the character of the trail changes. Some unusual flowers you may be lucky enough to spot under the canopy are broom-rape, coral root, candy stick or twayblade. This quiet trail climbs gently high above Kuskanax Creek, all the way to the original hot springs. The trail is eventually joined by the trail from Nakusp Hot Springs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Bike:<\/strong> The old horse trail is not steep or technical except for one short section of switchbacks. The trail bed is firm. Requires a mountain bike. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Park anywhere in Nakusp and ride Hwy 23 to the Nakusp Hot Springs Rd. Follow it for 12 km to the hot springs. Find the signed source trail to the right &#8211; it is rough and rocky to the foot bridge and easier to portage your bike for this 50m. Trail generally good, narrow in places, mossy and soft. After 9km, pop out into a clearcut, descend the main skid trail\/road (rocky but ok on a mountain bike + brush so wear glasses). Reach pavement on Alexander Rd. Straight or right takes you to Hwy 6.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This historic route was initially used by miners at the turn of the century.
