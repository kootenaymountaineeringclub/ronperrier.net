This tiny stone\/brick church sits on a rocky outcrop at the very west end of the Old Town.

In retrospect, the best way here is to continue from St John the Theologian up through a park and end up at the fort, then walk back down through the whole of the Old Town from above.

October 11, 1941, is the day the Yugoslav communists in Vardar began to organize an armed insurrection against their Bulgarian occupiers with an attack on the local police station in Prilep. This launched the war for national liberation from fascist occupation, which coincided with the subsequent rise of the Macedonian communist resistance movement in the following years. It lasted until late 1944. It is a national holiday in Macedonia.<br \/>\nThe glorification of the Communist Partisan movement became one of the main elements of post-war Yugoslav political propaganda. The very Macedonian nation, state and language were the result of Yugoslav communist policies. Since Macedonia gained independence in 1991, the picture has not changed significantly. It is all a myth as the Bulgarian army entered Vardar Macedonia on April 19, 1941, and was greeted by the locals as liberators. In the October 11 attack, only a local policeman was killed. Soon after most of the leading pro-Yugoslav communists were annihilated or arrested and imprisoned until the 1944 Bulgarian coup d\u2019etat. The resistance movement then fell virtually under Bulgarian communist control. Through 1942 and 43, the resistance was weak and sporadic and the Macedonian partisans were not a significant military force.<br \/>\nThe Holocaust Museum in Scopje gave a slightly different story explaining the role some Jewish citizens who had escaped being sent to Nazi concentration camps played in the resistance movement.<br \/>\nThe above is from Wikipedia and is a significantly different story than what is presented in the museum. \u00a060 Den<br \/>\nGoogle Maps directed me to the Monument of the Partisans south of the city but could not find a route to it.

This has so many locations, it became confusing. Google Maps initially placed it about 25 km east of Prilep on the top of a mountain. The Prilep locals referred to it as the rocky summit north of town where there is a large steel frame cross and a ruined fort, part of a complex built by the Slavs in the 10<sup>th<\/sup> and 11<sup>th<\/sup> centuries.<br \/>\nUNESCO refers to it as a granite and gneiss rocky mass estimated to be 720 million years old. It has many shapes resulting from erosion into fissures, faults and bending producing peaks, bare rocks, columns, spurs, mushrooms, balls, caverns and passage recesses.
