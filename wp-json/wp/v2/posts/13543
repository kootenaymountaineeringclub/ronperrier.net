The glacier forms the south boundary of Glacier Creek.<\/em><br \/>\n<em>Probably the trail and area\u2019s greatest use was in the \u201cold days\u201d when the annual KMC mountaineering course spent a weekend here learning glacier travel, crevasse rescue and then climbing either Cauldron or Truce. There has always been a trail that follows the crest of this moraine. It tops out at almost 8,500 feet before hitting ice.
