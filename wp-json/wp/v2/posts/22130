They called it Qhapaq \u00d1an. The Qhapaq \u00d1an traverses one of the world\u2019s most extreme terrains, including the driest non-polar desert on earth (the Atacama), steamy rainforests, desiccated salt flats and some of the highest Andean peaks beyond the Himalayas.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The only Inca trail most people have ever heard of is the 26-mile path from Piscacucho (near Cusco,\u00a0Peru) to the jungle-clad ruins of Machu Picchu. One of the planet\u2019s most iconic treks, it lures some 25,000 hikers each year. Meanwhile, the trails of the greater\u00a0Qhapaq \u00d1an\u00a0network have gone largely unnoticed, unused, and unprotected.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">This extraordinary feat of preindustrial engineering allowed the Inca\u00a0to communicate, exchange goods, and consolidate power during the height of the empire in the late 15th century. It was a line chart for administering an empire.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">More than a simple path, the Incas crafted it\u2014in many cases, atop existing paths\u2014with a series of stone structures roughly nine miles apart. Called tambos, they were motels, military checkpoints, and supply hubs rolled into one. It rarely heads straight up or down, navigating geographic obstacles (mountains, river valleys) in such a mannered way that groups of soldiers or caravans of llamas could easily tackle it, trudging from tambo to tambo. The Incas perfected everything, from the lengths to the angles, altitudes, steps, and gradients. You couldn\u2019t ask for a better route from point A to point B. The Inca built the trails in very high places because the higher you go in the Andes, the fewer ravines you have to cross and the fewer hassles encountered. There are also more springs, lakes, and water. It was built on the backs of Inca men performing mit\u2019a or mandatory public service. They chewed coca leaves to ward off altitude sickness. It\u2019s hard to understand how these monumental stone paths have been all but forgotten by time.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The sprawling network\u2019s main Peruvian corridor is the 1,800-mile Great Inca Trail. It runs from Cuenca,\u00a0Ecuador, in the north, to Cusco, Peru, in the south. The higher-altitude sections through the center of Peru\u2014between 11,000 and 15,000 feet, behind the perennially snowcapped peaks of the Cordillera Huayhuash and Cordillera Blanca mountains are the best preserved due to their relative isolation and small population centers. Yet, even here, villagers have removed stones from paths to create corrals for animals or bases for mud-brick homes. Mining companies have also paved over sections of the Qhapaq \u00d1an to build access roads.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Today, the Great Inca Trail could become an epic tourist route akin to the\u00a0Pacific Crest Trail. In Peru, the Qhapaq \u00d1an cuts a swath through the Andes between the Inca archaeological sites of Hu\u00e1nuco Pampa, an Inca city notable for its stone storehouses and a ceremonial\u00a0ushnu\u00a0or pyramid and Huarautambo. Work is concentrating on the roughly 100-mile stretch in the middle, offering five-day 50-mile treks north and south of\u00a0Hu\u00e1nuco Pampa, Temperatures in the winter high season (May to September) can swing from the 60s with blazing sun to the low teens with frost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>INCA TRAIL to Machu Picchu<\/strong>\u00a0January 17-21, 2012<br \/>\nOne of the seven modern wonders of the world, Machu Picchu is probably the most important archaeological site in the western hemisphere and a Unesco World Heritage Site since 1983.<br \/>\nIt is on everyone\u2019s bucket list and can be visited in many ways including by bus or train (the fastest, easiest and cheapest), or by several trekking routes.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The <strong>Inca Trail<\/strong> is a 47 km walk, 80% using the original stone pavers of the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu. At the time it was the only route to Machu Picchu. This is the hardest and most expensive way ($645) and is as much part of the experience as the actual ruins. 500 permits are given per day for the Inca Trail and need to be booked weeks in advance, especially in the busy dry season from May to September. Only 200 permits are for tourists, and the other 300 are for the porters and guides. As it was the rainy season, it rained most days. I used an umbrella, the best way to hike in the rain as it allows great ventilation.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">SAS is the biggest company offering the Inca Trail. They provided 2 guides and 21 porters including the cook. The porters carried 27 kg each and had SAS uniforms. There were 15 in our group \u2013 I was 62 and the next oldest was 36. By day 2 everyone but me and a fellow from Wales employed porters to carry personal stuff. We carried our sleeping bag, pad and all personal gear while the porters carried the tents, and all cooking and dining gear (including a big eating tent, table and chairs). We were up at 5 every day to eat and start walking by 6:30. The sumptuous meals were almost of gourmet quality. and most of us gained weight despite all the exercise.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The route goes through incredibly steep terrain and narrow valleys.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><u>Day 1<\/u>. Up at 5 am to bus 3 hours to km 82 on the rail line (elevation 2380m), the trail followed the Urubamba River briefly before starting to climb. Passing 3 Inca ruins, we camped at 3300m in a steep-walled valley.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><u><br \/>\nDay 2<\/u>\u00a0started with a stiff climb over Dead Woman`s Pass, at 4200m, the highest part of the trail, then a descent to 3600m, another ascent to 4000m and then a descent to 3600m again to camp.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><u><br \/>\nDay 3<\/u>\u00a0was another ascent to 4000m and then a steep knee-destroying descent to 3000m to\u00a0<strong>Wui\u00f1ay Wuayna<\/strong>\u00a0with its tremendous ruin often dubbed \u00a8little Machu Piccu\u00a8. There were 50 terraces each supported by 5-8 foot stone walls, 14 fountains, many houses, and intricate stonework on the upper ruins.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" nofocus\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/38\/dc\/9a\/38dc9a3d423fe7909b6978f78009f5a4.jpg\" alt=\"Winay Wayna Peru | Inca trails, Machu picchu, Picchu\" width=\"619\" height=\"464\" aria-label=\"Winay Wayna Peru | Inca trails, Machu picchu, Picchu\" data-bm=\"7\" \/><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" nofocus\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https:\/\/dreamy.tours\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/1-1.jpg\" alt=\"Winay Wayna in Per\u00fa - Cusco - South America\" width=\"618\" height=\"386\" aria-label=\"Winay Wayna in Per\u00fa - Cusco - South America\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><u>Day 4<\/u>\u00a0We were up at 3:45 to eat and hurry up and wait for the control point that opened at 5:30.
