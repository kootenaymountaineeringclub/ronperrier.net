The seven hikers agreed: it had all the pleasures of a higher altitude hike without too much effort, and it was promptly added to personal lists of favourite hikes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The trail passes through a pleasant mossy subalpine forest, then ascends steeply to an alpine meadow with a steep drop-off, giving stunning views to the north and east after less than an hour&#8217;s hiking. Another 30 minutes up, a boulder-strewn slope brings you to the top with 360 views which included Kootenay Lake, Crawford Bay, the West Arm, Kokanee Glacier, and a sea of peaks to the south and east. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">A short walk along the narrow ridge top brings you to a viewpoint where you can look down at olive-green Oliver Lake, 1200 feet below.
