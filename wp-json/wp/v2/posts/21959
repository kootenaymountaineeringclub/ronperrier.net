Karst will not develop in chalk, as chalk is highly porous rather than dense, so groundwater flow is not concentrated along fractures. Karst develops where the water table is relatively low, such as uplands with entrenched valleys, and where rainfall is moderate to heavy. This contributes to the rapid downward movement of groundwater, which promotes dissolution of the bedrock,<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><span id=\"Chemistry_of_dissolution\" class=\"mw-headline\">Chemistry of dissolution. <\/span><\/strong>The carbonic acid that causes karst forms as rain passes through Earth&#8217;s atmosphere picking up carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2<\/sub>), which readily dissolves in the water. Some of the dissolved carbon dioxide reacts with the water to form a weak carbonic acid solution, which dissolves calcium carbonate. The oxidation of sulphides leading to the formation of sulfuric acid can also be one of the corrosion factors in karst formation. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><br \/>\nMorphology.<\/strong> The karstification of a landscape may result in a variety of large- or small-scale features both on the surface and beneath it.<br \/>\nOn exposed surfaces, small features may include solution flutes, runnels, limestone pavement, kamenitzas collectively called karren or lapiez.<br \/>\nMedium-sized surface features may include sinkholes or cenotes (closed basins), vertical shafts, foibe (inverted funnel-shaped sinkholes), disappearing streams, and reappearing springs.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Large-scale features may include limestone pavements, poljes, and karst valleys. Mature karst landscapes, where more bedrock has been removed than remains, may result in karst towers, or haystack\/eggbox landscapes.<br \/>\nErosion along limestone shores in the tropics, typical karst topography includes Thailand&#8217;s Phangnga Bay and Halong Bay in Vietnam.<br \/>\nBeneath the surface, complex underground drainage systems (such as karst aquifers) and extensive caves and cavern systems may form.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Calcium carbonate dissolved In water may precipitate out where the water discharges some of its dissolved carbon dioxide. Rivers that emerge from springs may produce tufa terraces, consisting of layers of calcite deposited over extended periods. In caves, a variety of features collectively called speleothems are formed by deposition of calcium carbonate and other dissolved minerals.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><span id=\"Kegelkarst.2C_salt_karst.2C_and_karst_forests\"><\/span><strong><span id=\"Kegelkarst,_salt_karst,_and_karst_forests\" class=\"mw-headline\"><br \/>\nKegelkarst, salt karst, and karst forests. <\/span><\/strong>Kegelkarst is tropical karst terrain with numerous cone-like hills, formed by cockpits, mogotes, and poljes without strong fluvial erosion processes.

The karst terrain is difficult for humans to traverse, so ecosystems are often relatively undisturbed.

Surface water containing natural\u00a0carbonic acid moves down into small fissures that lead to progressive enlargement of openings forming a conduit system that drains the aquifer to springs. Groundwater flow rate in karst aquifers is much more rapid than in porous aquifers. Groundwater in karst areas is easily polluted as Karst formations are cavernous and highly permeable, resulting in reduced opportunity for contaminant filtration.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Farming in karst areas must take into account the lack of surface water. The soils may be fertile enough, and rainfall may be adequate, but rainwater quickly moves through the crevices into the ground, sometimes leaving the surface soil parched between rains.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><b><br \/>\nSOUTH CHINA KARST<\/b> A UNESCO\u00a0World Heritage Site\u00a0since June 2007,<sup id=\"cite_ref-UNESCO_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup> this spans the provinces of Chongqing, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan.

The Polish couple on the trip got into the rice moonshine and were so hung over the next morning, they skipped the <strong>Ken Cave<\/strong>. After a 200m swim, we explored another half-kilometre dry cave with some good formations at the end and then had the same swim back. It was a rough hike back across rugged karst mountains.<br \/>\nThe guide, food, caves and company were all excellent and well worth the expensive $250 cost. We crossed many flat fields on the way back \u2013 all cultivated for crops other than rice. It seems women do all the work and men ride around on motorbikes, play cards and checkers, and drink rice wine. After the fields were plowed they broke up the clods by standing on a simple frame of 2 boards pulled by a water buffalo.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 16px;\">PHONG NHA KE BANG National Park<\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"> has a pristine jungle with over 90% primary forest and hundreds of caves in the oldest karst landscape in SE Asia, including the largest cave in the world.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">I went on a one-day national park tour.

It has an internal, fast-flowing subterranean river.<br \/>\nHang S\u01a1n \u0110o\u00f2ng was founded by a local man in 1991. The whistling sound of wind and the roar of a rushing stream in the cave is heard through the entrance. The steep descent prevented the local people from entering the cave.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Only in 2009 did the cave become internationally known after a group of cavers from the British Cave Research Association surveyed Phong Nha-K\u1ebb B\u00e0ng. Their progress was stopped by a large, 60-metre (200 ft) high flowstone-coated wall, which was named the Great Wall of Vietnam. It was traversed in 2010 when the group reached the end of the cave passage.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The main S\u01a1n \u0110o\u00f2ng cave passage is the largest known cave passage in the world by volume \u2013 38.4\u00d710<sup>6<\/sup> cubic metres. It is more than 5 kilometres long, 200 metres high and 150 metres wide. Its cross-section is believed to be twice that of the next largest passage, in Deer Cave, Malaysia.<br \/>\nIt has 2 large dolines, areas where the ceiling of the cave has collapsed and allows sunlight to enter resulting in the growth of trees.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The cave contains some of the tallest known stalagmites in the world, up to 70 m tall and cave pearls the size of baseballs, an abnormally large size.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In early August 2013, the first tourist group explored the cave on a guided tour at a cost of US$3,000 each. Permits are required to access the cave and are made available on a limited basis, with 1000 permits available for the 2019 and 2020 seasons, which runs from February to August. As of 2017 only Oxalis Adventure Tours have permission to enter the cave for tourism purposes.

The Yucatan is flat and low and is made of limestone bedrock that allows the rainwater to filtrate the soil allowing underground lakes and rivers. They are former caverns whose roofs have caved in. Their water is unbelievably clear and may have stalactite and stalagmite formations making them a favourite for divers and snorkelling. Bring a mask and snorkel to see all the rock formations and fish.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div class=\"richImage loading\">\n<div class=\"mainContainer \">\n<div class=\"imgContainer\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Maya used the cenotes as precious and unique water sources and as sacred places for their religious ceremonies. It was the residence of the gods, who had direct influence over human affairs. Perhaps none of the area\u2019s features was of more sacred importance than the cenotes, the distinct Yucat\u00e1n sinkholes where the ancients believed it was possible to commune with the rain god Chaac.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Some 6,000 of these cenotes, whose name derives from the Mayan ts\u2019onot, cover the peninsula, an abundance partially owed to the geological impact of the dinosaur-destroying Chicxulub asteroid that hit the area 65 million years ago. Mayan settlements were typically established in the vicinity of cenotes, for both practical purposes, namely a water source, and ritual purposes, such as sacrificial offerings to Chaac and calculation of harvests.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br \/>\n<em>Getting there.<\/em> Cuzam\u00e1 may be reached by a 1.5-hour bus that departs from the Noreste terminal in M\u00e9rida, but travel by car is recommended. The cenotes are open daily from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.; the last cart leaves the departure point at 3:30 p.m. The price for a ride on the cart, which carries four people was 300 pesos (but may be more now).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Three completely separate cenote complexes around Cuzama are run by three different cooperatives: X\u2019Tohil, Cuzama, and Chunkan\u00e1n. It&#8217;s easy to get them confused with one another. All three Cuzama cenote cooperatives provide similar experiences with a horse-pulled cart ride, yet they visit different cenotes. Competition is fierce and you\u2019ll experience people flagging you in as you approach.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Cuzum\u00e1 cenotes are in a remote jungle area distant from the idyllic town. Getting there is half the fun. Pari and arrive at the Decauville train track system &#8211; rickety, crooked, and narrow (2\u2019) rail lines with mall railway trolleys pulled by horses.

Now the ghost rails that once hauled the \u201cgreen gold\u201d of the Yucat\u00e1n to the ports of Mexico lug sweaty tourists to the cenotes.

A 50-foot vertical ladder descends into apparent blackness. The crystal blue waters, illuminated by a small hole in the ceiling, stretch out like a glass floor. Thirsty tree roots dip down from the dome-like ceiling for a drink; they mingle with tooth-like stalactites.

It was easy to recognize shells and corals, especially brain corals.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" nofocus\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https:\/\/www.floridastateparks.org\/sites\/default\/files\/media\/image\/GEOwindley.png\" alt=\"GEOL 204 The Fossil Record: Clocks in the Rocks: The Geologic Record &amp; Geologic Time\" width=\"620\" height=\"413\" aria-label=\"GEOL 204 The Fossil Record: Clocks in the Rocks: The Geologic Record &amp; Geologic Time\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The 2009 camp was just west of Height of the Rockies Provincial Park.

It is known for its karst formations with pinnacles and magnificent caves. Its altitude varies from 27m at the park headquarters on the floodplains to 2,377m at Mulu summit with topography from flat but deeply cut floodplains to the steep mountain slopes and vertical cliffs of the limestone gorges.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Tropical rainforest (jungle) exists only under 22.5 degrees \u2013 it requires high daily temperatures and at least 200mm of rainfall per month.

Many cave-living species are unique.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Most visitors to tropical rainforests expect to see huge numbers of birds, mammals and reptiles scurrying about on the forest floor and swinging through the trees \u2013 but that is not what they are like. Despite high biodiversity, there is low species abundance. The animals are all there but are generally very shy of us predatory humans and most of us are not very clever at spotting them. We smoke, wear insect repellent, antiperspirants, and perfumes and make noise. Animals know we are coming long before we are close enough to see them.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Mulu is best known for its caves, the largest caves in the world. The caves were first discovered in 1856 but forgotten until 1961. It wasn\u2019t until 1978 that they were actively explored.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Why are Mulu\u2019s caves so big? The upper limestone layer here is 1500m thick and extremely fine-grained and thus very hard. The limestone under it is thin and much more fragile. With movement of the earth\u2019s crust, the area was tilted and folded 30 degrees producing cracks and fractures, allowing easy water movement through the hard limestone. With lots of rain, cave formation occurs rapidly in geologic time. The cave passages at Mulu are generally long, straight, and wide and tend to be circular in cross-section with little roof collapse. They show 1.5 million years of geologic history. The giant doline of the Garden of Eden is one of the world\u2019s finest examples of the collapse process. Cave fauna has evolved because of the transfer of food energy from the forest to caves by bats and swiftlets. Millions of bats and swiftlets entering and leaving the caves is a spectacle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The geologic highlight of the park is the <strong>Pinnacles<\/strong>, a fantastic collection of razor-sharp limestone formations that rise to 50m. It was entirely booked out when we were to be in Sarawak. This is a 3-day\/2-night trip that entails a longboat trip and then an easy 9km walk to a camp. From camp 5, the trail to the ridge overlooking the Pinnacles is 2.4 km and a 1200m vertical climb. The last section is vertical with several ladders and ropes to climb. If the guide thinks you can\u2019t reach the top in time before being able to descend by dark, it is necessary to return to camp. The trip back down is often much harder. You have to supply your food, water and sleeping bag.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2017\/06\/04\/sarawak-the-trip\/4242978817_8ae8cb7424_b\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6323\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6323 lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sp-ao.shortpixel.ai\/client\/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024,h_683\/http:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/4242978817_8ae8cb7424_b.jpg\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sp-ao.shortpixel.ai\/client\/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024\/https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/4242978817_8ae8cb7424_b.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sp-ao.shortpixel.ai\/client\/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_300\/https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/4242978817_8ae8cb7424_b-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sp-ao.shortpixel.ai\/client\/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_768\/https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/4242978817_8ae8cb7424_b-768x512.jpg 768w\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"414\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sp-ao.shortpixel.ai\/client\/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024,h_683\/http:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/4242978817_8ae8cb7424_b.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/sp-ao.shortpixel.ai\/client\/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024\/https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/4242978817_8ae8cb7424_b.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sp-ao.shortpixel.ai\/client\/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_300\/https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/4242978817_8ae8cb7424_b-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sp-ao.shortpixel.ai\/client\/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_768\/https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/4242978817_8ae8cb7424_b-768x512.jpg 768w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Instead of the Pinnacles which required 3 full days, we booked many cave tours.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u2018<strong>Show Caves.<br \/>\n<\/strong>1.

We finally reached the actual cave and walked past the walkway along the rocky bank for several hundred metres including an area of rockfall. It was then swimming time \u2013 we swam back down to the walkway with the current. Anna can\u2019t swim so we used a dry bag inside a small backpack to add flotation and gave a brief lesson on breaststroke. She floated on her back and did fine.

Each bat weighs about 15 grams and eats approximately 2\/3s of its body weight in insects every night \u2013 that equals about 20 tonnes of insects per night for the whole colony. Bats also play an active role in pollinating plants \u2013 fruits favoured by bats hang upside down, and have flowers that open at night and are white.<br \/>\nThe cave also has swiftlets, the birds whose saliva makes their nests and is valued as bird\u2019s nest soup. They also use echolocation to navigate the dark caves but have an audible click whereas the sound bats use is outside the range of the human ear. As swiftlets feed during the day, the residents of the cave provide 24-hour, around-the-clock insect control. Deer Cave is always visited late in the day to see the bat exodus.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_6328\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 611px;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/2017\/06\/04\/sarawak-the-trip\/rha-120-3319\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6328\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-6328 lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sp-ao.shortpixel.ai\/client\/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_2000,h_1333\/http:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/steamworkshop_webupload_previewfile_147054426_preview.jpg\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sp-ao.shortpixel.ai\/client\/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_2000\/https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/steamworkshop_webupload_previewfile_147054426_preview.jpg 2000w, https:\/\/sp-ao.shortpixel.ai\/client\/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_300\/https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/steamworkshop_webupload_previewfile_147054426_preview-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sp-ao.shortpixel.ai\/client\/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_768\/https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/steamworkshop_webupload_previewfile_147054426_preview-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sp-ao.shortpixel.ai\/client\/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024\/https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/steamworkshop_webupload_previewfile_147054426_preview-1024x682.jpg 1024w\" alt=\"\" width=\"611\" height=\"407\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6328\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sp-ao.shortpixel.ai\/client\/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_2000,h_1333\/http:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/steamworkshop_webupload_previewfile_147054426_preview.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/sp-ao.shortpixel.ai\/client\/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_2000\/https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/steamworkshop_webupload_previewfile_147054426_preview.jpg 2000w, https:\/\/sp-ao.shortpixel.ai\/client\/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_300\/https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/steamworkshop_webupload_previewfile_147054426_preview-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sp-ao.shortpixel.ai\/client\/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_768\/https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/steamworkshop_webupload_previewfile_147054426_preview-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/sp-ao.shortpixel.ai\/client\/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024\/https:\/\/www.ronperrier.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/steamworkshop_webupload_previewfile_147054426_preview-1024x682.jpg 1024w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" \/><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-6328\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Tiny figures show the scale of the Deer cave looking back to the mouth of the Deer cave, Mulu National Park, Sarawak, island of Borneo, Malaysia<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It is a truly huge cave up to 125m high.

Ten of the world\u2019s 46 species of hornbill are found in Malaysia, many in small, isolated populations.

There are two great viewpoints. We had lunch of a bunch of bananas in the \u201ccathedral\u201d, an area at the bottom of the tsingy in the shade.
