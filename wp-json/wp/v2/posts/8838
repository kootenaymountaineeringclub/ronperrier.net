It was the first trading post in the region. From it, Thompson explored the Columbia River from source to mouth. <\/em><em>Kinbasket, a chief of the Shuswap Indians, had led his people over this route in the early 1800s to their present home near Invermere.\u00a0<\/em><em>Then in 1866, the route over the Purcells to the head of Kootenay Lake was examined for a possible railway line but was judged unfeasible because a long tunnel through the divide was needed. <\/em><em>During the late 1800s and early 1900s, this trail was an important access and supply route from the east, with cattle even being driven over it from Invermere.<\/em>\u00a0<em><br \/>\nDuring a visit to BC in 1908, Earl Grey (1904-1911), perhaps better known for his donation of football&#8217;s Grey Cup than as\u00a0<\/em><em>Governor-General,\u00a0<\/em><em>crossed the Purcell Mountains from Invermere to Argenta on Kootenay Lake by the trail up Toby Creek and down Hamill Creek. He was so impressed with the 10,000-foot peaks and extensive glaciers that he recommended the area for inclusion in a proposed national park. Not only that, he sited and paid for a public cabin near the start of the trail. The cabin was sturdily built and in good condition until the 80s. This trail and the high pass (then called Wells Pass) were later named in Earl Grey&#8217;s honour.<br \/>\nPublic interest in the pass and trail was revived in 1972 by a group of local students who published the Earl Grey Pass Project.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Location:<\/strong> Purcell Wilderness Conservancy<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Difficulty:<\/strong> D1<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Elevation gain:<\/strong> 1525m (5000&#8242;)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Key elevations:<\/strong> West trail register 805m (2640&#8242;); Earl Grey Pass (44km) 2280m 7480&#8242;; East TH\u00a01174m (3850&#8242;)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Distance:<\/strong> 61kms (38 miles)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Time:<\/strong>\u00a03-5 days\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Access:<\/strong> Easy<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <strong>Season:<\/strong> early July to late September<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Maps:<\/strong> 82K\/2 Lardeau, 82K\/7 Duncan Lake and 82K\/8 Toby Creek<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Drive<\/strong>:<br \/>\n<strong>East Access:<\/strong> From Invermere, drive through town towards Panorama Ski Resort.

Continue beyond the Post Office, following signs to the corner in the logging road. With a high-clearance vehicle, drive the rough road 1km to the trailhead.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Trail:<\/strong> Follow the old road down to the trail which descends nearly 300m (985&#8242;) to Hamill Creek. At the bottom of the hill, the trail intersects the original wagon road that came up Hamill Creek. Take time to walk back along the moss-covered trail to the bridge site. Parts of it may still be standing. After returning to your pack, continue along the trail, crossing Clint Creek and making your way along several renewed cribbed sections. The cable car, installed prior to 1929, but refurbished since then, zooms across the creek. Remember to leave the cable car hanging free after use. There are six cable cars on the complete trail.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Soon after leaving the cable car, you reach the compressor site.<br \/>\nDuring the 1905-1906 period, a 10-drill Allis-Chalmers compressor was installed, driven by a large Pelton wheel which originally had a 35m (115&#8242;) head of water. High-pressure air was pumped 1200 m (3940&#8242;) up to the Argenta lead-silver mine on Lavina Ridge above Hamill Creek! All these materials were brought by wagon up the road\/trail through the canyon, In the fall of 1907, the mine closed and soon after the lower canyon became impassable for wagons.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">From the compressor site, the trail leads to McLaughlin&#8217;s Cabin, built in 1906, and the second cable car. From this point the trail follows the creek, often close to it, but sometimes well back amongst the huge cedars and hemlocks. Some old cabins exist as do remains of OFY trail maintenance camps of the early 1970s. Opportunities For Youth (OFY) was a federal government employment project that saw students working on the trail for one or two seasons. This was the first major work the trail had seen for decades. Numerous large slide paths are crossed; follow ribbons and previously cut alder and be careful at creek crossings. The BC Forest Service maintains the first 14.5 km of trail, the BC Parks maintained the remainder. Because the trail is classified as wilderness, it is not maintained as well as some trails in other provincial parks.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">17km, start the climb slowly to the pass on a rougher trail.<br \/>\n32.5km, near the end of the valley, referred to as &#8220;north forks&#8221;, walk through an ancient cedar forest for half a day, and climb about 823m (2700&#8242;) in the final 8.5kms to Earl Grey Pass. The pass is underwhelming &#8211; below the tree line, straddling the ridge in a tiny notch with poor views. The panoramas are outstanding with chances of seeing mountain goats, elk and bears. Plan on camping at the toe of Toby Glacier below the pass for at least one night, if not two. There is a lot to wander around and see.<br \/>\nFor encompassing views, climb Slate Peak from the pass. Fast strong day hikers can make it to Earl Grey Pass via the shorter eastern approach.\u00a0Earl Grey Pass (44km) 2280m 7480&#8242;.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">From the pass, one descends into the Toby Valley, passing Toby Falls. The trail follows the original route for the most part, slowly winding down the valley. Parts of the trail are used by guide outfitters and outdoor enthusiasts from the Invermere region.\u00a0Often the trail is a muddy horse-tromped mess.\u00a0Because of the frequent creek crossings on Hamill Creek, horses do not go on this side and the trail is better preserved. The predominately spruce forest on this drier eastern side is underwhelming. Unbridged tributaries and overgrown avalanche paths round out the adventure. Near the end of the trail a cabin is passed, built for Governor General Earl Grey. Soon after you reach Jim MacKay&#8217;s horse corral and the end of the trail.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Campsites &amp; Milestones:<\/strong> There are few level spots to put up a tent. This is especially so from Rock Creek on the Hamill side over the pass and down Toby Creek. Try to reach and use the established campsites, most small with room for only two tents (keep groups down to 4 or fewer people). There are no outhouses. Leave no trace. There is no water at the pass, except perhaps from a seasonal creek 100m down the west side.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>8km &#8211; Garnet Beach campsite.<\/strong> 910m (2980&#8242;).

These routes formed the lifelines of a fledgling colonization that would change the region forever. The Earl Grey Pass Trail, which traverses over a 2,256-metre pass in the Central Purcells to link East and West Kootenay, is one of the few historic routes not replaced by a road. It remains one of the region\u2019s premier wilderness, adventure experiences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\"><a class=\"cursor-init\" href=\"https:\/\/kootenaymountainculture.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/earl-grey-trail-west.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-13127\" src=\"https:\/\/kootenaymountainculture.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/earl-grey-trail-west-1200x874.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"472\" \/><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The trail begins southwest of Invermere and travels 61 kilometres west to Argenta. Over the years, it\u2019s been rerouted around avalanche debris and blowdown, boardwalks were built along steeper sections, and, cable cars were placed over dangerous creek crossings. And this summer, to celebrate Canada\u2019s anniversary, Earl Grey is getting a special upgrade. Thanks to funding from the Canada 150 Program, Columbia Basin Trust and the Regional District, recent washouts will be repaired, as will damaged cable cars in Hammill Creek. Interpretive signage will also be installed to explain traditional Ktunaxa Nation knowledge of the route, along with other historical highlights.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\"><a class=\"cursor-init\" href=\"https:\/\/kootenaymountainculture.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/early-grey-trail-east.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-13128\" src=\"https:\/\/kootenaymountainculture.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/early-grey-trail-east-1200x709.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"652\" height=\"385\" \/><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Even with these upgrades, which will be done by BC Parks and the\u00a0Kaslo\u00a0and District Community Forest Society\u00a0Youth\u00a0Crew,\u00a0the\u00a0trail is a grind. It\u2019s\u00a0full of runoff\u00a0debris, head-high stinging nettle, and other surprises,\u00a0so hikers\u00a0who complete\u00a0it\u00a0earn substantial backcountry cred.\u00a0It\u2019s hard to imagine one cow, let alone a whole herd, travelling this trail and\u00a0arriving intact at the other end. But that\u2019s exactly what used to happen. Here\u2019s a look at the\u00a0story behind\u00a0of one of the\u00a0Kootenays\u2019\u00a0most significant\u00a0byways.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_12820\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-12820\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-12820\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Albert Henry George Grey was the first to propose the central Purcell range be set aside as a national park.<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The Earl Grey Pass Trail began as a well-worn, hoof-and-claw path that showed the way to Ktunaxa hunters and traders. They in turn guided early miners across the Purcells, and the trail was expanded to allow horse travel in the Kootenay mining boom of the late 1800s. The route was known as the \u201cBeef Trail\u201d in the early days, as cattle were driven across from the ranches in the east to feed hungry miners in the west.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The region saw its first brush with fame in 1908 when Albert Henry George Grey, Canada\u2019s ninth Governor General and the fourth Earl of Grey, visited and fell in love with it. That summer he travelled on horseback up Toby Creek from Invermere, through the ancient forests of Hammill Creek, to the mining settlement of Argenta.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">So stoked was he with the forests, game, glaciers, and towering peaks of the Central Purcells, he had a family cabin built on Toby Creek a year later. Governor General Grey even wrote to then Premier of British Columbia, Richard McBride, making the case to set the region aside as a national park. The proposal did not bear fruit, however, and for the next five decades the still remote, Central Purcells were visited by climbers, prospectors, hunters and trappers. That changed when Toby Creek\u2019s Mineral King Mine, first staked in 1898, was substantially developed in the 1950s.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">This development, along with an explosion of forestry roads into the heart of the Purcells, prompted the Invermere Rod and Gun Club along with Argenta hippies to push for the protection of the remaining wilderness. In the early 70s, Federal funds were received via the Opportunities for Youth project to reroute the trail past burned-over areas. Invermere resident Pat Bavin lead the project in 1972. \u201cIn July of that year, we took a 10-horse, pack train of dried food up to the Toby Glacier outwash, and worked for 10 days on, out for four, all the way through to September,\u201d he says. \u201cRestoring the trail\u2026was quite a challenge since it was totally overgrown with numerous avalanche debris zones.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Bavin\u2019s\u00a0crew also mapped the headwaters of Toby Creek and created a\u00a0master\u00a0plan\u00a0for a future,\u00a0alpine-protected area.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Finally,\u00a0in\u00a01974, after a first-of-its-kind,\u00a0grassroots conservation effort that saw hunters and trappers united with hippy tree-huggers, an Order-in-Council literally stopped\u00a0bulldozers in their tracks with the creation of the Purcell Wilderness Conservancy. The Earl Grey Pass\u00a0Trail traverses\u00a0its\u00a0northern limits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Hikers will still find Earl Grey\u2019s family cabin perched at the edge of a massive avalanche path, looking west past the dramatic Pharoah Peaks to the headwaters of Toby Creek. The intervening century has left the log structure in a ruinous state, although, miraculously, much of the roof still remains. A stone hearth welcomes. Bits of beds and furniture are still visible through a mountain of packrat middens. Behind it lies the remains of an outhouse and what must have been either a log barn or servant\u2019s quarters, or both. The essence and the romance of the wild Purcells are still strong here, carried on by the very sense of discovery and awe by the trail\u2019s early explorers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">For more information about the Earl Grey Pass Trail, log on to the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.env.gov.bc.ca\/bcparks\/explore\/parkpgs\/purcell\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">provincial government park\u2019s website<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Dave Quinn <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Born in Cranbrook, British Columbia, Dave is a wildlife biologist, educator, wilderness guide, writer and photographer whose work is driven by his passion for wilderness and wild spaces.
