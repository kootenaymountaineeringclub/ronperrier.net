Investigation of allegations of collusion between the big four were started in July.<br \/>\nFive large institutional shareholders with overlapping holdings discourage vigorous competition resulting in ticket prices up to 11% higher than they would be otherwise. Operating margins for North American carriers exceed 14%, around double those of airlines from Europe and Asia. The overlap of institutional shareholders in these carriers is much lower than in NA. In Europe, low-cost carriers (Ryan Air, Easy Jet, Norwegian Air and Wizz Air) compete fiercely with older airlines.<br \/>\nThe US also has a rule banning foreigners from owning more than 25% of voting shares in a domestic carrier. Besides preventing the likes of Ryanair and Air Asia fro creating wholly-owned American subsidiaries. The rule starves domestic challenger airlines of foreign capital. Virgin America would have attacked the domestic incumbents if its British owner, Virgin Group could have injected more capital.<br \/>\nA shortage of take-off and landing slots at America\u2019s busiest airports makes it hard for challengers to achieve a decent market share.

In Brazilian and not in English.irlines in SA.<br \/>\n<strong>Why the continent\u2019s airlines are losing so much money<\/strong><br \/>\nWhen phone footage came to light last year of a stripper opening the throttle during the take-off of a commercial jet operated by Aerol\u00edneas Argentina, the public outcry was predictably fierce. Argentina\u2019s state-owned flag carrier swiftly sacked the pilots who had invited her into the cockpit and the lady herself was banned from the airline for five years. Endangering the safety of passengers is a serious concern. Yet the company\u2019s assault on the public finances is almost as reckless: Argentines have tolerated vast subsidies and huge losses at their national airline.<br \/>\nEven without the drag of state ownership, other South American airlines have recently either lost money or made only meagre profits. Airlines in Latin America as a whole (whose performance is flattered by the inclusion of Mexico\u2019s mostly profitable flyers) even surpassed Africa\u2019s beleaguered carriers in their ability to lose money in 2015. That marks them out at a time when the tailwinds of growing passenger numbers and cheap fuel have carried many other airlines to unusual heights of profitability.<br \/>\nThe region\u2019s airlines don\u2019t lose money because flights are cheap. Air fares are eye-wateringly pricey\u2014an internal flight in Brazil can cost as much as one to Europe. Travellers have not benefited from the ascent of low-cost carriers (LCCs) because budget airlines are thin on the ground. Outside Brazil\u2019s domestic market, where Azul and Gol carry passengers between the country\u2019s far-flung cities, there are few LCCs and their impact has been limited. As a result, the continent\u2019s growing middle-classes have not taken to the skies as enthusiastically as in the rest of the world.<br \/>\nThis is partly attributable to a lack of infrastructure. There are few secondary airports of the sort frequented by LCCs in Europe or specialist low-cost terminals at bigger airports that are common in Asia. That lands LCCs with the same high airport fees as big carriers. Gol, the largest Brazilian LCC, made a loss of 4.29 billion reais ($1.3 billion) in 2015.<br \/>\nIn some countries, budget carriers have been kept at bay by state-run incumbents. Cash-rich left-wing governments in the region set up or revived flag carriers as money poured in when commodity prices were high. In Bolivia and Venezuela state-owned airlines are virtually the only means of domestic air travel. Appointing cronies has ensured inept management.<br \/>\nThe standard of service on state airlines is often woeful. Aerol\u00edneas cancels three times more flights than the industry average, and loses roughly twice as many bags. Venezuelan travellers have the added problem that foreign airlines are leaving the country in a dispute over how to repatriate money from sales because the government cannot find the dollars to pay them for tickets issued in the country.<br \/>\nElsewhere publicly listed airlines provide much better service but are just as hard to dislodge. LAN Chile set up subsidiaries in Peru, Argentina, Ecuador and Colombia before merging with TAM, Brazil\u2019s biggest airline, in 2012. LATAM is now the largest airline across swathes of the continent. In smaller markets such as Peru, Chile, and Ecuador LATAM and Avianca, a Colombian carrier, already have big networks that leave little space for LCCs to operate domestically. Barriers to entry are high: dealing with a slew of differing regulations makes setting up new cross-border routes expensive.<br \/>\nWhy then are the incumbents not making more money? LATAM lost $219m in 2015; Avianca lost $140m. As passenger numbers grew during the commodities boom, most airlines ordered lots of expensive new planes. But just as they arrive on the tarmac, demand for air travel is stumbling. South America is still reeling from the bursting of the commodities bubble. This has hit domestic and cross-border air travel alike. Worries about the spread of the Zika virus have also deterred visitors to the continent. In 2016 growth in passenger traffic in Latin America is likely to lag every other region, according to IATA.<br \/>\nSome of the continent\u2019s politicians have woken up to the industry\u2019s structural problems. In Argentina, Mauricio Macri, the victor in November\u2019s presidential election, has announced plans to withdraw a $500m subsidy from Aerol\u00edneas. The airline\u2019s new management plans to cut capacity and return to profit by 2020. Brazil is negotiating with the EU for an \u201copen-skies\u201d deal that would boost competition by allowing airlines from those countries to serve any airport in Brazil. Before her impeachment the country\u2019s president, Dilma Rousseff, was said to be considering raising the share foreigners can own in local airlines from 20% to 100%, allowing better-run foreign carriers to buy domestic ones.<br \/>\nMichel Temer, Brazil\u2019s interim president, is also said to be considering a relaxation of foreign-ownership rules. And intrepid budget carriers will doubtless try to overcome the difficulties and set up routes in more countries. But unless more politicians in the region turn their attention to aviation, South America will continue to be the continent of sky-high fares and limited choice.<\/p>\n<p><strong>WHY DO THINGS TASTE DIFFERENT?<\/strong><br \/>\nThe high decibel level in the cabin interferes with how people perceive taste. The palate registers sweets such as soft drinks less intensely, while the taste known as umami is heightened. Thirsty passengers may find they yearn specifically for rich and savoury, and frequently choose tomato juice. Lufthansa estimates they serve as much tomato juice as beer aboard its flights.<br \/>\nThis phenomenon is not unique to aircraft &#8211; other loud environments also alter taste perception &#8211; this may explain why dinner at a noisy restaurant doesn&#8217;t always hit the sweet spot.  <\/p>\n<p><strong>THINGS to BRING AND DO on EVERY INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT<\/strong> (And 3 Things Not To)<br \/>\nTraveling is exciting, but for many travellers, the flying part of the journey can be brutal. With tiny seats and limited legroom, flying is no longer something I look forward to \u2014 instead, it\u2019s something I know I have to endure in order to visit my next travel destination.<br \/>\n1. <em>Noise Cancelling headphones<\/em> (or earplugs). Not all noise cancelling headphones are the same. Cheap ones are rarely worth it &#8211; the Bose QuietComfort 20 and over-ear 25s are comfortable, good and tiny. Ear plugs are a cheap alternative.<br \/>\n2. <em>USB cable<\/em>. USB plugs at every seat are becoming common. They won\u2019t recharge very quickly. Not all USB cables are the same as some don\u2019t let your phone charge at it\u2019s maximum. Check out Wirecutter\u2019s pick for some cheap cables that do.<br \/>\nIf you\u2019re an Apple user, this counts for Lightning cables too (as they\u2019re basically just USB with an expensive connector).<br \/>\n3. <em>USB battery pack<\/em>. Use this external battery to recharge your various mobile devices. Never run out of juice again. Necessary to watch movies on your tablet for the whole flight.<br \/>\n4. <em>Camera<\/em> (or your phone) especially if you\u2019re in the window seat.<br \/>\n5. <em>An extra layer<\/em>. Airplanes can get cold, especially at night. Bring a long sleeved pullover or fleece, window seats especially those on an exit row are cooler than those on the aisle..<br \/>\n6. <em>Travel Pillow<\/em>. Neck pillows, your own pillow or inflatable pillows.<br \/>\n7. <em>Eye mask<\/em>. Mandatory for a good sleep.<br \/>\n8. <em>Pen.<\/em> To fill out immigration forms, make notes, whatever.<br \/>\n9. <em>Passport.<\/em> Always travel with this most precious document on your person. Memorize you number, date of issue and expiry.<br \/>\n10. <em>Address<\/em> where you\u2019re staying.<br \/>\n11. <em>Entertainment.<\/em> You want to keep your mind occupied to attempt to forget about the fact that your seat barely reclines and you will have zero personal space for the next several hours: in-flight movies or reading with a Kindle, paperback or audiobooks (download from Audible to your phone).<br \/>\n12. <em>Hydration.<\/em> Plane air is dry like the desert &#8211; it\u2019s extremely easy to get dehydrated. Stick with water while you\u2019re in the air. Bring a collapsible water bottle and ask the flight attendants to fill it up. Keep your nostrils hydrated with saline nasal spray. Bring moisturizers like lip balm and a simple skin moisturizer.<br \/>\n13. <em>Sleep.<\/em> Surprisingly, boarding the plane relatively rested is key. Don\u2019t plan on using the flight as a way to catch up on your sleep (unless you are one of the lucky few who has no problem sleeping in an upright position). For red-eye flights, consider a sleep aid like Melatonin. It\u2019s one of the few sleep aids that won\u2019t make you groggy if you don\u2019t catch a full 8-hours of sleep on the plane. Eye masks, neck pillows and blankets are a must on overnight flights. If a neck pillow feels like too much to carry, blow up an inflatable beach ball and place it on top of your tray table.<br \/>\n14. <em>Exercise.<\/em> Try to get up and walk around every couple of hours to stretch your legs. This is where an aisle seat comes in handy. If you are in a window seat and you don\u2019t want to bother your seat mates every couple of hours, do some neck and ankle stretches while sitting down.<br \/>\n<strong>Things you SHOULDN\u2019T BRING:<\/strong><br \/>\n1. Fruit (and often nuts and seeds). This varies by country, but usually these are prohibited. New Zealand and Australia allow nothing.<br \/>\n2. Water\/beverage. The only liquids allowed through security are under 30ml\/1oz. Get new water past security.<br \/>\n3. Anything that smells: kimchi, durian, yourself (including your feet). Shower before your flight. This isn\u2019t your living room. Don\u2019t clip your toenails. <\/p>\n<p><strong>JET LAG<\/strong><br \/>\nWe all feel jet lag differently \u2013 some barely notice the effects on their circadian rhythms, while others are almost incapacitated and feel like a zombie for a week.<br \/>\nJet lag is a chronobiological problem, as is shifting your body clock when undertaking shift work. When we travel long distances, our circadian rhythm (internal body clock) is temporarily out of synch with the new destination\u2019s time. This means that internally we anticipate dawn and dusk to fall at certain times, which are suddenly at different times than what\u2019s happening outside. The desynchronization affects not just sleep, but also body temperature, blood pressure, hormone regulation, when we get hungry and how hungry we are. Jet lag is the lag time between our internal body clock and the place we are now inhabiting.<br \/>\nOur body clocks run on a slightly longer than 24-hour cycle, with a \u201cmaster clock\u201d in our brain that uses our exposure to light to coordinate all of the workings of our organs. Consisting of a group of nerve cells in the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (or SCN), this master clock is located in the hypothalamus. Genes also influence the body\u2019s clock and circadian rhythms, which helps explain the variance in adjusting to time change from one person to another.<br \/>\nThe body\u2019s production of melatonin, a sleep hormone produced by the pineal glad to signify to our body that soon it will be time for rest, affects our body\u2019s internal time measurement system. That system is also influenced by the direction we travel; heading west is easier on our body than flying east. It takes about a day to adjust to each time zone we cross. For some, crossing a few time zones might be harder on our body clocks than a larger gap.<br \/>\nFor example, it would take you about eight days to recover from a westward trip across nine time zones, if you did nothing to fight it. But if you cross the same number of time zones going east, recovery could take more than 13 days. This recovery time is worse with crossing more time zones.<br \/>\nThis is all because the body\u2019s internal clock has a natural period of slightly longer than 24 hours, meaning that the body has an easier time with lengthening the day (heading west) than shortening the day (heading east).<\/p>\n<p>These tips are a compilation of tips and experimentation that may work for you. Many have had no scientific study. If you don\u2019t deal with jet lag well, these will likely help.<br \/>\n<strong>1. Melatonin<\/strong><br \/>\nWhen night falls and there is less light input to the SCN, melatonin secretion increases. At dawn, the levels of melatonin drop again and the body\u2019s daytime circuits take over. Just like jet lag itself, we all respond to melatonin in our own individual way. Personal experimentation may be necessary to figure out your dose. But the suggested dose is much smaller than the dosing recommendations on the bottle. Taking too much risks having the effects spill over to the next day &#8211; irritability, hunger, and generally no fun.<br \/>\nFor jet lag, start with 1\/4 of a 3mg tablet just before bed. If you wake up in the middle of the night wide awake because you master clock thinks it\u2019s daytime, take another 1\/4 of a 3mg tablet.<br \/>\nMalatonin is also available for transdermal use as Sprayable Sleep.  For super sensitive people, you can control the dosage even further.<br \/>\n<strong>2. Restrict Blue Light Exposure at Night<\/strong><br \/>\nPart of regulating circadian rhythms is to get in the habit of signalling to your SCN and your body when it\u2019s time for bed and when it\u2019s time to wake. Artificial \u201cblue\u201d light (even though it looks white), present in LEDs, fluorescent lighting and the backlit screens of our portable devices, is a daylight signaler to our minds. Without travel it can get confused, but can be even more confusing when your body clock thinks it\u2019s halfway around the world.<br \/>\nEvening use of light-emitting eReaders negatively affects sleep, circadian timing, and next-morning alertness. People produce 55% less melatonin when using an iPad at night and they need extra time to fall asleep. Further, the sleep had less rapid eye movement (REM) time. The next morning, iPad users feel sleepier and have difficulty feeling awake. And the next night the same iPad users had their circadian rhythms delayed by over an hour, causing them to feel tired later. In contrast, those who read books wake with more alertness.<br \/>\nBy restricting blue light at night, it is a lot easier to shift your body\u2019s clock when needed, sleep is more sound, and morning alertness is better. Here are some ways to restrict blue light at night:<br \/>\n<em>a. F.lux on Your Laptop.<\/em> F.lux automatically blocks blue light from your screen at sunset based on your location, and lightens it in the morning. It\u2019s basically pillows for your eyes. Although it\u2019s a free programme, please donate. If you are more productive in the evenings and can happily work away well into the night, your sleep may become impaired from all the blue light exposure. F Lux can make a huge difference to the way that you can work productively in the evening without feeling terrible the next day.<br \/>\n<em>b. iOS\u2019 \u2018Night Shift\u2019 or Android\u2019s Twilight App.<\/em> Both block blue light, essentially \u201cFluxifying\u201d your device for evening use, which can help you sleep.<br \/>\n<em>c. Blue-blocking Glasses.<\/em> Uvex Skyper Blue Light Blocking Computer Glasses with SCT-Orange Lens block blue light and allow you to read on all your devices.<br \/>\n<strong>3. Shift Your Time Zone Early<\/strong><br \/>\nPreemptively signal to your body that you are \u201cin\u201d that new time zone will shorten your adjustment period considerably.<br \/>\na. Set F.lux to the new time zone 5 days before leaving, so your laptop blocks blue light during that country\u2019s nighttime hours.<br \/>\nb. If it\u2019s a particularly important trip where jet lag needs to be lessened maximally, wear the blue blocking glasses around the house during nighttime at your new destination. They are not attractive so you may not want to leave the house with them.<br \/>\nc. At the same time as you start your F.lux schedule, take melatonin at what will be the beginning of dusk in your new destination. You will struggle more with sleep during those few days, but the process truly limits time\u2019s impact upon landing.<br \/>\nd. The free <em>Jet Lag Rooster<\/em> app will show you exactly how to shift your schedule based on your bed time, waking hours, and travel plans.<br \/>\ne. <em>Re-Timer glasses<\/em> emit green light and aim to slowly shift the time of day that light is received by your eyes to complement your travel schedule. Wear about 50 minutes per session. Retime your body clock in small steps before you travel and continue the process after you arrive.<br \/>\n<strong>4. Morning Light &#038; Exercise<\/strong>.<br \/>\nAfter arriving, work out in the mornings to get your blood flowing and wake you up even more. Even if you are more awake at night, refrain from exercising then as it will simply wake you up further.<br \/>\nRather than succumbing to the desire to crawl under the covers and stay there, expose yourself to natural morning light, especially in the initial days. Stick your head out the window and open the curtains, to help remind your body that it\u2019s actually day-time.<br \/>\n<strong>5. Food and Alcohol<\/strong><br \/>\nThe SCN affects not only sleep but also hunger. Eating at the wrong times can signal to your body that you\u2019re not where you actually are.<br \/>\nAirlines try to serve meals for the coming time zone shift, offering breakfast before a dawn landing for example. After arrival, you may crave food during your home\u2019s dining hours but stick to the new time zone\u2019s meal hours.<br \/>\nAlcohol dehydrates you and interferes with regulation of time zones. Stick to water. <\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, jet lag isn\u2019t that bad. It\u2019s temporary state and allows us to let go of life\u2019s reigns a little bit, and sink into disorder.<br \/>\nAs Pico Iyer summarized it best. \u201cFourteen hours later, I\u2019m on a different continent and hardly able to imagine the life, the home, I left this morning. It\u2019s as if I have switched into another language \u2014 a parallel plane \u2014 and none of the feelings that were so real to me this morning can carry through to it. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to hear them; it\u2019s that they seem to belong now to a person I no longer am.<br \/>\nThere is something gloriously discombobulating about emerging from a long flight into the fog of a new place. So even if the impacts of jet lag lessen but never go away fully, there are far worse states of mind to inhabit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>WHERE&#8217;S the SAFEST PLACE to SIT on a PLANE?<\/strong> (17 accidents since 1985 with both fatalities and survivors were studied)<br \/>\nWhile it depends on the nature of the accident, middle seats in the rear of the plane have been historically had the best survival with a 28% fatality rate. The last row is the best of these as it is closest to one of the exits in case of a fire. Front seats have 38% fatalities, middle 39% and rear 32%.<br \/>\nEmergency Exits. Fires can be deadly in 2-3 minutes. Regulations state that a plane must be able to evacuate in 90 seconds. The five row rule says that sitting more than five rows from a viable exit have a greater chance of dying than living.<br \/>\nSafety Cards in Back Seat Pockets. 89% of passengers don&#8217;t read the emergency procedures on the cards. And only half watch the preflight safety presentation.<br \/>\nNumber of commercial airline accidents in the US since 1985: 368. Survival rate in those accidents: 96%. Lifetime odds of dying from an air-transport accident: 1 in 8015.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How to Find a Cheap Flight Other Websites Useful When Flying How to Stay Cool on Your Next Flight Country\/Continent Specific Information Why do Things Taste Differently?
