In 1994, the manual added Pervasive Developmental Disorder\u2014Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) and Asperger\u2019s syndrome.<\/p>\n<p>By recasting the DSM criteria, children were excluded from accessing support for education, behavioural therapy, insurance reimbursement, and other essential services. By the end of the decade, however, the startling rise in diagnoses \u2013 and the alarms in the media that autism had become an epidemic \u2013 took all by surprise.<\/p>\n<p>Infantile autism was added to the DSM-III in 1980, removing the swamp of schizophrenia, and establishing it as the core of a new category of \u201cpervasive developmental disorders\u201d. Autism was framed narrowly in terms of its two cardinal signs: \u201cpervasive lack of responsiveness to other people\u201d coupled with \u201cresistance to change\u201d. The onset was specified as before 30 months,\u201d which ruled out virtually all the kids who would be later diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s syndrome.<\/p>\n<p>To accommodate kids who suffered a loss of skills after 30 months, there was \u201cChildhood-Onset Pervasive Developmental Disorder\u201d (COPDD). It was described as being even rarer than autism. Few clinicians bothered with the ill-conceived diagnosis.<\/p>\n<p>In the 1987 DSM-III-R, the word infantile was finally gone for good, and the COPDD diagnosis was also dropped. Crucially, the non-negotiable checklist had been replaced by a banquet of options to pick and choose from: at least eight of the following 16 items, including two from A, one from B, and one from C. This ensured that fewer children would slip through the diagnostic net. The descriptions of these behaviours were also made less absolute. The new criteria could be applied to a larger and more diverse population. This triggered a significant rise in diagnoses, as it was better at picking up on cases of autism at every level.<\/p>\n<p>However, PDD-NOS was subthreshold autism. It quickly eclipsed autistic disorder to become the most used PDD diagnosis. Like Asperger\u2019s syndrome, it was an autism diagnosis that didn\u2019t contain the word autism and thus was more readily accepted by parents and healthcare workers.<\/p>\n<p>By the end of the process, autism had been transformed into something that Kanner would have barely recognized.<\/p>\n<p>Estimates of autism prevalence began to increase worldwide after the publication of the DSM-III and DSM-III-R. This was no surprise to Lorna Wing: awareness of autism among professionals was dramatically growing at the same time that the boundaries of the condition were expanded, realigning themselves with the reality of the spectrum, to 1 in 100 children. In England, between 1990 and 2000, cases increased by an average of 22% per year and continued to rise.<\/p>\n<p>A similar evolution was taking place in the United States, prompted by amendments to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Clinicians applied the diagnosis more readily and increased awareness among school teachers and staff. Few parents could afford Lovaas\u2019s forty hours of ABA a week to achieve \u201cfull recovery\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>TEACH introduced the\u00a0Child Autism Rating Scale\u00a0(CARS) in 1980, which was particularly good at distinguishing autism from other forms of developmental delay, such as intellectual disability. The scale was highly reliable and consistent, and its scores correlated well with assessments by other means. New raters could be trained in a single one-hour session. CARS also provided an accurate picture of the child\u2019s strengths, which is crucial for developing an appropriate education plan. The second edition of CARS was introduced in 1988 and was easier to use, allowing it to be applied to diagnose both teenagers and adults.<\/p>\n<p>An international team introduced the\u00a0Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)\u00a0to assess communication, social interaction, and play in children and then extended it to teenagers and adults.<\/p>\n<p>The clinical population was changing enormously, but the clinical outcome barely changed \u2013 50% of the autistic population are mute and remained that way. Even high-IQ autistic adolescents sustained rudimentary social relationships. The outlook looked relentlessly monochrome.<\/p>\n<p>Asperger\u2019s syndrome knowledge was still in its infancy as it shaded into subclinical eccentricity \u2013 was it truly a mental disorder or a common personality type? Asperger\u2019s was a disorder of social impairment subject to social context.<\/p>\n<p>The term Aspie would become a badge of honour and defiant pride within a decade. The genie of autistic intelligence was poised to escape the bottle in which it had been trapped for 50 years. The DSM-IV added Asperger\u2019s, resulting in more families gaining access to services.<\/p>\n<p>The DSM-IV was an international smash that earned $100 million. It was a 900-page behemoth that found its way everywhere. Instead of requiring that a child display impairments in social interaction, communication, and behaviour before getting a diagnosis of PDD-NOS, the criteria substituted the word \u201cor\u201d for \u201cand\u201d. This typo went uncorrected for 6 years, and about 75% of children identified as not having the disorder (true negatives) were incorrectly identified as having it, creating a true autism epidemic and a statistical nightmare.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A strategic series of revisions to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual on Mental Disorders, prompted by Lorna Wing and her colleagues in London, was chipping away at Kanner\u2019s monolithic edifice from the inside.
