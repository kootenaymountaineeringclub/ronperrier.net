Asperger may have been the first clinician to notice that his patients\u2019 imaginations occasionally anticipated developments in science by decades, forcing him to amend his statements that their interests were \u201cremote\u201d from real-world concerns. Many turned their youthful obsessions with science fiction into careers in science. For many people on the spectrum in the years when they were still invisible to medicine, science fiction fandom provided a community where they finally felt like savvy natives after years of being bullied and abused by their peers for seeming naive, awkward, and clueless.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Another community that enabled autistic people to make the most of their natural strengths was amateur radio. By routing around the face-to-face interactions they found so daunting, even people who found it nearly impossible to communicate through speech reached out to kindred spirits, found potential mentors, and gained the skills and confidence they needed to become productive members of society.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>SCIENCE FICTION<br \/>\n<\/strong>From Hugo Gernsback\u2019s Amazing Stories grew pulp fiction and the first fandom in the modern sense, with its elaborate customs, art forms, specialized jargon, conventions, and absurdly bombastic internecine warfare. This fractious and fertile milieu nurtured the careers of many writers who went on to mainstream fame, including film critic Roger Ebert and screenwriter Leigh Brackett, celebrated for her work on <em>The Big Sleep, The Long Goodbye, and The Empire Strikes Back<\/em>. Other fans, including Ray Bradbury, Isaac Asimov, Frederick Pohl, and Ursula Le Guin, became science fiction immortals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Most importantly, magazines like <em>Amazing Stories and Weird Tales<\/em> fired up the imaginations of those who turned the extravagant visions of their favourite authors into cold facts. The original members of the British Interplanetary Society, founded in 1933 to promote space exploration, were avid readers of the pulps. Arthur C Clarke observed in 1948, that many American scientists were also fervent fans, and that \u201caeronautics would never have reached the stage it has now if it wasn\u2019t for science fiction, which has done much to break down the psychological barrier that retard our progress.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Darko Suvin, a leading scholar of the genre, described the subversive impulse at the heart of science fiction as an expression of \u201ccognitive estrangement\u201d from the mainstream. Fandom tapped into a deep yearning to rise above the circumstances of humdrum existence and become part of something noble, people-informed, and not widely understood. The thrill of being part of something few people could appreciate was particularly keen for those who had spent their lives being ridiculed. No one could make you a fan\u2013or prevent you from being one-but yourself, and no one could judge you but your peers of choice: your fellow \u201dfen\u201d. Early fans indulged these newfound feelings of confidence and superiority to the hilt, referring to the clueless nonfans who ran the world as \u201dmundanes\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Unlike cult followings based on sports teams or rock stars, science fiction fandom was rooted in an essentially solitary activity: reading. Traits typically viewed as pathological or pathetic in the mainstream (like obsessing over trivia while accumulating vast hoards of treasured ephemera) were rewarded in the community as signs of \u201ctrufan\u201d commitment. Fandom offered what every homesick space child yearned for: membership in an elite society of loners united by their belief in the future. For those who had felt like exiles their whole lives, forced to live among strangers, becoming a fan was like finally coming home.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><br \/>\nIn 1940, a Canadian, A.E. van Vogt, raised the bar and inaugurated the golden age of science fiction. He portrayed \u201cnormal\u201d human beings not as saviours but as the enemy. His tropes echoed through later generations of science fiction: the political machinations in <em>Dune<\/em>, <em>Star Trek\u2019s<\/em> half-Betazoid counsellor Deanna Troi, the hunt for rogue replicants in <em>Blade Runner<\/em>, the mutant superpowers of the <em>X-Men<\/em>. First-generation fans saw a reflection of their predicament in the tale of the superintelligent, supersensitive, and profoundly misunderstood mutants struggling to survive in a world not built for them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Claude Degler<\/strong> carried this notion further. At a young age, he was obsessed with electricity and plunged into science fiction. Precociously bright,\u00a0 Degler made the honour roll in high school, but when he was 15, his anxiety, depression, and violent outbursts \u2013 exacerbated by constant bullying &#8211; resulted in his expulsion. 1936 he was committed to the Eastern Indiana Hospital for the Insane.<br \/>\nAfter reading van Voyt\u2019s <em>Slan<\/em>, his true destiny became clear. He and his fellow fen were \u201cstar-begotten\u201d mutants trapped behind enemy lines. Science fiction was the first stirrings of a geek uprising against the mundanes who had oppressed them for so long. \u201cFight to make the world safe for science fiction\u201d.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">In the 1940s, he contributed to a dizzying array of publications. He advocated for forming all-fan households called Slan shacks, where his comrades could pursue their passions with minimal interference from pesky mundanes. One in Battle Creek, Michigan, attracted fans from everywhere to savour \u201cthe feeling of closeness, of being able to be open in our ideas.\u201d Slan shacks popped up all over the US and the UK.<br \/>\nHe fell out of favour when it became apparent that many organizations existed only in his brain. But there was more than a grain of truth in Degler\u2019s insistence that science fiction fans were mutants struggling to survive in the margins of a society that did not understand them. A significant minority of his fellow fans would likely have been eligible for a diagnosis of Asperger\u2019s syndrome had one been available. For people on the autism spectrum, the alternate universes of science fiction may have felt less alien than the baffling sea of mundania in which they found themselves marooned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>HAM RADIO<br \/>\n<\/strong>Many fans were also ham radio operators, and the two subcultures had a significant crossover. Many with keen interests in science and engineering worked in menial jobs because of their limited social skills. Fandom was an unusually accepting community of individual quirks and differences.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Gernsback\u2019s amateur radio network was a boon for those most likely to yearn for an Isolator. One ham alone in a garage with a spark transmitter was a nerd, but a network of hams was a force to be reckoned with. By chaining stations together in relays, a Chicago amateur could \u201cwork\u201d his equivalent in Christchurch, passing messages around the globe. Planet Earth suddenly became a small and convivial place for a ham.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">During WWII, the British spy agency MI8 secretly recruited a crew of teenage wireless operators to intercept coded messages from the Nazis. By forwarding these transmissions to the crack team of code-breakers at Bletchley Park, led by the computer pioneer Alan Turing, these young hams enabled the Allies to predict the movements of the German and Italian forces accurately.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">With the rise of wireless, the scattered members finally had a way to become a collective force in the public sphere. Ham radio was an activity that rewarded fascination with apparatus, systems, and complex machines, and amateurs with keen memorization abilities had an advantage because all hams in the United States were required to learn Morse code to earn their FCC licenses until 1990.<\/p>\n<p>With parts available by mail at reasonable prices, it was an affordable hobby that could be pursued in solitude. Hams who struggled with spoken language could avoid talking altogether by communicating in code. (a photo of an early gathering of hams showing two men sitting across a table from one another, communicating by tapping out dots and dashes on milk bottles with spoons).<\/p>\n<p>But those who enjoyed gabbing away could \u201cchew the rag\u201d with other hams for hours, employing a lexicon as witty and ritualized as the fandom jargon. The culture of wireless was also a strict meritocracy where no one cared about what you looked like or how gracefully you deported yourself in public. You were welcome to join the party if you knew how to set up a rig and keep it running.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">A new world opened up to him. First, he got a new name\u2014his radio call letters. Thenceforth, he had a new personality and new social status.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Wireless also offered ways into the job market for people who couldn\u2019t depend on their ability to charm interviewers or cultivate networks of in-person contacts. The society of hams also enabled shy introverts to study the protocols of personal engagement from a comfortable distance. They learned about communication between people \u2013 the give-and-getting process, which is what communication is all about.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">TV made its public debut in 1928, 172 spacecraft left the Earth\u2019s surface in 1967, and a new generation of visionaries raised on do-it-yourself electronics and pulp science fiction was laying the groundwork for a global network that would make the wireless revolution look quaint.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The curious fascination that many autistic people have for quantifiable data, highly organized systems, and complex machines runs like a half-hidden thread through the fabric of autism research.
