However, in 1891, Corbin persuaded the provincial legislature to pass a private act incorporating the Nelson and Fort Sheppard Railway by promising to connect the railway to the coast and by using a group of Canadian businessmen as a front for the railway.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">With the Columbia and Kootenay Steam Navigation Company providing boat access along the Columbia River to his railway, he had indirect access to the rich mining areas of the Kootenays. Concerned with this development, the Canadian Pacific Railway reacted by building the Columbia and Kootenay Railway (C&amp;K) between Robson (near Castlegar) and Nelson in 1891, the unnavigable section of the Kootenay River between Kootenay Lake and the Arrow Lakes.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div class=\"thumbinner\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/File:NelsonAndFortSheppardRailway.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"thumbimage\" src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/c\/c8\/NelsonAndFortSheppardRailway.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"633\" height=\"536\" data-file-width=\"321\" data-file-height=\"272\" \/><\/a><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br \/>\nIn 1893, Corbin received a charter from the Canadian government, declaring it to be a work for the greater advantage of Canada and transferring the railway corporation to federal jurisdiction. The connection to the coast was never built, but the railway did reach Nelson in 1893 as the Nelson and Fort Sheppard Railway (N&amp;FS). Fort Shepherd was a former Hudson&#8217;s Bay Company fort on the bank of the Columbia River on the United States border (note the different spellings). The N&amp;FS connected Nelson with the Canada\u2013United States border at Waneta, near Trail. It immediately crossed a 500-foot bridge over the Pend d&#8217;Oreille River that still stands. The railway climbed out of the Columbia Valley past the community of Fruitvale to Salmo. From Salmon Siding (now Salmo), the railway went north up the Salmo River valley to Ymir and then began the descent to Kootenay Lake. The line passed Nelson to the east as it descended along the hillside. The rail line was initially forced to use &#8216;Mountain Station&#8217;, located high above Nelson, with a steamer dock at Troup (also known as File Mile Point), 8 kilometres northeast of the &#8216;Queen City&#8217; on Kootenay Lake. In 1895, a rail loop was established at Troup with a line along the lake to the outskirts of a neighbourhood called &#8216;Bogustown&#8217; just outside of Nelson, now known as the Fairview neighbourhood.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Another significant step in railway expansion was the opening of the Great Northern Railway main line from Spokane to Seattle, also in 1893.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Construction was successful despite many reverses &#8211; the 1893 panic (put nearly all Western railroads in the hands of receivers), a railroad strike (which Corbin&#8217;s employees refused to join), and the great Columbia River flood of 1894 (which washed out much of the roadbed) &#8211; he still finished this road. Though he fell behind on his salaries, he paid every dollar he owed.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In the early days, the rail line formed a meaningful connection for the West Kootenay mining towns, allowing efficient shipping of their rich ores to the United States. With an all rail route to the United States and direct access to the Great Northern, the N&amp;FS could provide more direct access to markets than the CPR could with its C&amp;K. Business was so great on the S. F. and N. that they didn\u2019t have the equipment to handle the large volume of business &#8211; boxcars were used to haul people.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The railway line was operated by a variety of corporate owners following the Great Northern acquisition in 1898. When the Canadian Pacific Railway was built along Kootenay Lake in 1900, the section between Nelson and Troup Junction was sold to the CPR, and the GN was given trackage rights.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The railroad from Spokane to Oroville, built between 1903 and 7, was the main line of the SF&amp;N. Passengers had to change trains at Marcus for Northport and Canadian points. At Grand Forks, BC, for Phoenix, and the Kettle Valley depot.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The SF&amp;N was prosperous for about 15 years, with the hill country in the Kootenay\/Boundary its biggest shipper. In 1920, the mines in Phoenix closed down and were dismantled. Phoenix, with 4,000 people and once the largest copper mining town in Canada, was abandoned. This closed the smelters in Grand Forks and Greenwood, taking much revenue from the SF&amp;N.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Passenger traffic also flowed between Nelson and Spokane from 1893 to 1941.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The GN was merged into the\u00a0Burlington Northern Railroad\u00a0(BN) in 1970. The creation of the\u00a0Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway\u00a0(BNSF) in 1996 saw the N&amp;FS receive its third change in ownership.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">All train traffic into the region ceased in 1989, except in the section between Waneta and Ross Spur that continues to see active rail use to this day. In 1998, the rails and ties were removed between Ross Spur and Salmo, and in 1999, the final removal of the rails and ties between Salmo and Troup was completed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Drive:<\/strong> Parking areas for access to the Great Northern Rail Trail.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><em><strong>Salmo.<\/strong><\/em> Burlington Northern Railway Station on Railway Ave on Highway 6.

Running generally north-south, it extends from Salmo, on Highway 3, following Highway 6 to Nelson, then east to Troup Junction where it converges with the Canadian Pacific Railway on Kootenay Lake, about 8 kilometres east. Historically, and at present, this trail links the communities of Salmo, Summit, Ymir, Nelson and Troup.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Salmo<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Beginning in the Village of Salmo, the trail winds north through a picturesque rural area in the environmentally sensitive Salmo River Valley. Climbing for 30 kilometres at an average grade of 1%, the trail passes through the historic settlement of Ymir, a former mining town, to Summit, and then descends past Cottonwood Lake Regional Park, to form the southeastern boundary of the City of Nelson, linking in numerous places with the street system.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The trail&#8217;s gravel surface is highly degraded in the Salmo area but improves as the trail heads north, away from heavy motorized activity. The RDCK allows motorized use on the trail&#8217;s southern half from Salmo to roughly Hall Siding. Off-highway vehicles cannot legally cross highways (as of Winter 2014). The damage caused by motorized vehicles typically tapers off at the first highway crossing north of Salmo. The trail normally improves in quality as it approaches Mountain Station, above Nelson.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The trail is also part of The Great Trail (aka Trans Canada Trail). The section from Mountain Station to Cottonwood Lake is part of the Great Trail through route. The entire GN Trail from Troup to Salmo is considered to be a Great Trail spur.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Annual closure in effect April 15 to June 15 (approx) &#8212; Due to grizzly bear foraging each spring, the Salmo Great Northern rail trail usually is closed annually for 10 kilometres between Cottonwood Lake and Hall Siding (northern section, about 8 km south of Nelson) from mid-April to mid-June. The trail operator, the Regional District of Central Kootenay (RDCK), is responsible for this closure. Users are asked to use the highway as a bypass route when the closure is in effect.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The section of the Nelson-Salmo Great Northern Trail between Wildhorse Creek Road and Wesco Road is closed indefinitely due to flooding of the Salmo River, which has washed out a significant portion of the trail.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>RAIL TRAIL to TROUP BEACH<\/strong>\u00a0(5 Mile Point)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">An easy, gentle walk on an abandoned rail trail ending up at a great beach on the West Arm of Kootenay Lake, 8 km east of Nelson<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Difficulty:<\/strong> easy 2.4% grade<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Elevation Gain\/Loss:<\/strong> 164m<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Key Elevations:<\/strong> Svoboda Road parking 693m \/ 2274 feet.
