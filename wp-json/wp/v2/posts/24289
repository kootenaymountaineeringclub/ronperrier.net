The Gal\u00e1pagos are famous for their endemic species, which were studied by Charles Darwin in the 1830s and inspired his theory of evolution through natural selection.<\/p>\n<p>Darwin\u2019s voyage\u00a0on\u00a0HMS\u00a0<em>Beagle<\/em>\u00a0was part of an extensive British survey of the coasts of South America.\u00a0Ecuador formally occupied and claimed the islands on 12 February 1832<br \/>\nThere are 7 large islands, 7 small islands and many tiny islands all volcanic in origin and relatively recent in origin (1-5 million years old with the oldest islands in the east and the newest in the west) and there is still volcanic activity with the most recent eruption in 2010. Fernandina has been the most active volcano since 1790, with recent eruptions in 1991, 1995, 2005, and 2009, Straddling the equator, islands in the chain are located in both the northern and southern hemispheres, spread out over a distance of 220 km (137 mi).<\/p>\n<p>With no natural enemies for millions of years, all the wildlife is amazingly tame (or habituated or genetically primed to not respond to non-threatening humans). Absolutely nothing reacts to your presence.<\/p>\n<p>This was still the dry season (wet season January to May) and the islands all are very rugged and desolate. The main tree is the Palo Santos tree, and with no leaves, a grey twiggy tree covering the barren lava fields and multiple volcanic cones. Wildlife is everywhere but mostly consists of iguanas (land and marine), sea lions (common and fur) and many birds \u2013 pelicans, blue-footed and Nasca boobies, albatross, magnificent frigate birds, mockingbirds, G. falcons and of course the famous 13 varieties of finch).<\/p>\n<p>There are only 116 visitor sites in the Gal\u00e1pagos: 54 land sites and 62 scuba-diving or snorkelling sites. Small groups are allowed to visit in 2- to 4-hour shifts only, to limit impact on the area. All groups are accompanied by licensed guides.<\/p>\n<p>I had booked the cruise ship, the Galavan 1 for a total cost, including flight and NP fees of $2,000. Many ships cost $5-6,000 for the same trip. The boat is the second lowest of 5 levels of cost but turned out to be a great deal with good food, rooms, guides and itinerary. For the first 4 days, we had 13 on the boat and for the second 4 days, there were 18.<br \/>\nWith 54 sites that allow visits, we went to 2 to 4 sites every day, seeing slightly different critters at each.<\/p>\n<p>We also snorkelled 1\u20132 times per day, and I was able to identify 23 different kinds of fish by the end. Watching sea lions fishing a few feet away and cruising by you constantly was amazing. Several sites also had green sea turtles, and it was incredible to float above 2 or 3 at once. With significant distances between sites, much time was spent motoring for several hours every day, mainly at night. That is why several islands are inaccessible when travellers try to see the Galapagos from the two towns.<br \/>\nUnfortunately, I developed a severe case of \u00a8tourista\u00a8 that responded well to antibiotics available on the ship. I spent two extra nights in Puerto Ayora and then flew back to Quito.\u00a8The Beak of the Finch\u00a8 is fascinating reading, and it won the Pulitzer Prize several years ago.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 1.<\/strong>\u00a0Flight from Quito via Guayaquil to Isla Baltra, A short bus and boat ride to Santa Cruz and a one-hour bus ride took us to Puerto Ayora, the biggest city in the Galapagos. We went out to the Galaven 1, got our rooms and then bussed to Rancho Pemiso, a private ranch in the highlands with large numbers of giant\u00a0<em>tortoises<\/em>. They were everywhere and extremely tolerant of close approaches. Each island has its own species. Of the 14 original species, 3 are now extinct \u2013 they were a favourite of the buccaneers as they could be kept alive with no food or water on board a ship for up to a year and were a valuable source of protein. The ones on Santa Cruz weigh up to 600 lbs, live 200 years, are all herbivores and get all their water from the plants they eat. The ones on Santa Cruz have very domed shells and most of the others (where the cactus is taller and they have to stand on their hind legs to reach the pads) are called saddlebacks. Nearby are lava tubes \u2013 these are huge with 20-foot high ceilings and spiral shapes, with the longest 1 km long.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 2<\/strong>.\u00a0We motored from 3-6 AM to Santa Fe. We had a wet landing to see many\u00a0<em>Galapagos common sea lions<\/em> with many young as they are born from Oct \u2013 Dec. They have only 1 pup and breastfeed exclusively for 1 \u00bd years. There is one male to about 20 females. The M\/F sex ratio is 40\/60, but most of the males are killed in dominance battles. Habituated, they allow easy close-up looks. Many large tree-like prickly pears served as food for iguanas. We snorkelled for one hour, and the water was quite cold. In the PM, we motored to <strong>South Plaza Island<\/strong>\u00a0on the east side of Santa Cruz, a small island with many sea lions and\u00a0<em>marine and land iguanas<\/em>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"detailCanvas\" class=\"\">\n<div id=\"mainImageRegion\" class=\" isvctrl nsp mainImageRegionView\" data-ufmc=\"savim1\" data-sfmc=\"savim2\" data-svitminfp=\"{&quot;SourceAttr&quot;:&quot;data-m&quot;,&quot;Mapping&quot;:&quot;murl:MediaUrl,purl:PageUrl,mid:MediaId&quot;,&quot;Loc&quot;:&quot;C&quot;,&quot;ItemTagPath&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;AttachToElementSelector&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;AttachDelay&quot;:0}\" data-svptnk=\"Images\" data-svptnerinfo=\"{&quot;PredefinedCollectionType&quot;:&quot;ImageDefault&quot;,&quot;Title&quot;:&quot;Saved Images&quot;,&quot;CollectionId&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;ItemType&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;APIItemType&quot;:&quot;images&quot;,&quot;CollectionTagPath&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-svloc=\"mainImageWindow\" data-svattr=\"data-m\" data-svmdcmp=\"IDPMainImage\" data-svcptid=\"MainImage\" data-persbtncls=\"psvctrl\">\n<div>\n<div id=\"mainImageContainer\">\n<div id=\"mainImageViewer\">\n<div id=\"mainImageWindow\" data-m=\"{&quot;mid&quot;:&quot;AE3165D2860FD80B9A0D572589F2F079B10E3F6F&quot;,&quot;purl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/traveljust4u.com.au\/itinerary\/ecuador-amazon-jungle\/blue-footed-booby-galapagos-islands-bird-sula-animals\/&quot;,&quot;murl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.traveljust4u.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/blue-footed-booby-galapagos-islands-bird-sula-animals-1536x960.jpg&quot;,&quot;turl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/ts4.cn.mm.bing.net\/th?id=OIP-C.cYAgReAluNa-qFcv8qC53wHaEo&amp;pid=Api&quot;}\">\n<div class=\"mainImage wide notbkg current curimgonview\" role=\"main\">\n<div class=\"richImage \">\n<div class=\"mainContainer \">\n<div class=\"imgContainer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"nofocus lazyloaded\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https:\/\/www.traveljust4u.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/blue-footed-booby-galapagos-islands-bird-sula-animals-1536x960.jpg\" alt=\"blue-footed-booby-galapagos-islands-bird-sula-animals - Travel Just 4U\" width=\"623\" height=\"389\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.traveljust4u.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/blue-footed-booby-galapagos-islands-bird-sula-animals-1536x960.jpg\" aria-label=\"blue-footed-booby-galapagos-islands-bird-sula-animals - Travel Just 4U\" data-bm=\"6\" \/><br \/>\nBlue Footed Boobies<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>Day 3.<\/strong>\u00a0<strong>Cerro Dragon<\/strong>\u00a0(Dragon Hill) on the north side of Santa Cruz.

Red sand beaches with red lava and palo santos trees not yet in leaf give a grey look to lava in the distance. The punta cactus had very short trunks.

Black sand beach and a long walk on the shore to lava along the ocean with many arches and surge channels forming Darwin\u00b4s toilet. Many large groups of black marine iguanas and G fur sea lions. When snorkelling, we saw many\u00a0<em>green sea turtles,<\/em>\u00a0including three very close.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 5.<\/strong>\u00a0Took a panga to\u00a0<strong>Black Turtle Cove<\/strong>\u00a0on the N coast of Santa Cruz.

We returned to Baltra and dropped off 6 and picked up 11. We motored to\u00a0<strong>North Seymour<\/strong>\u00a0and saw many\u00a0<em>frigate birds<\/em>\u00a0\u2013 males with big red pouches and young.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 6<\/strong>.\u00a0After a long overnight boat ride to\u00a0<strong>Espanola,\u00a0<\/strong>we snorkelled\u00a0on\u00a0<strong>Bahia Gardner<\/strong>, a beautiful big white sand beach with many sea lions off the beach and deep water snorkelling along the wall watching 2 sea lions fish not very successfully at very close range.
