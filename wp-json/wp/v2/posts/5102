If only going to tropical destinations, you do not need a down jacket, warm tops, and warm sleeping bag that you need for Nepal or Mongolia. Spring and fall travel in temperate climates will also require warm clothing. The list is intended to be all-inclusive &#8211; remove or add things as indicated by the trip. This represents what I have found over 19 years of travel to be the lightest, most compact and essential gear to go just about anywhere &#8211; whether cold or warm, if trekking or going on the Camino.<br \/>\nI have accumulated many specialized things that could only be purchased in Western countries. Even finding simple things can be a chore when you don&#8217;t know the language. You can get T-shirts anywhere; however, avoid cotton (terrible in hot climates and only good for sleeping) and prefer merino or polyester sport tops<br \/>\nI have included other packing advice: How to Pack Light, Ways to Save Weight, An Ultralight List, Tech Gadgets, Bicycles, Laundry, How to Take More Stuff on Airlines, Gear for Women and Exercise Gear for Women.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BACKPACK<\/strong>: This is possibly the biggest decision one makes. Carry-on or check luggage?<br \/>\nBackpack or suitcase? Up until 2022, I always used a 50 or 60-litre Deuter backpack, necessary for multiday treks but too large to be used as a carry-on. Then, I traveled through the Caribbean and Central and South America on a quick trip and experimented to find the best carry-on for me. A classic rolling suitcase with a handle was awful as so much room and weight were consumed by the &#8220;suspension\/wheel\/handle&#8221; system, and there were no shoulder straps. A rolling suitcase only works well in airports and train stations, and even there, escalators are a pain. Pull it over a cobble road to see how bad they are.<br \/>\nTravel packs are too heavy and expensive, and the suspension system is only suitable for short carries.<br \/>\nA 35-litre daypack worked well as it satisfied all carry-on requirements but was only large enough as I had no shoes, sleeping bag and many other things.<\/p>\n<p><strong>G4 FREE Backpack.<\/strong> Amazon has many backpacks, and they seem to change the brand name regularly, but the version I found was the G4 FREE, an incredible backpack that costs only CA$40. It is the largest carry-on possible. The seams and sewing are all very strong. The shell is a relatively lightweight nylon (it is not that abrasion resistant, but at this price, just buy another one when it wears). A larger pocket on top with a zip pocket under, a front zip pocket and an inside &#8220;large flap pocket&#8221; against the back help divide up your stuff. Using small, thin nylon bags increases its efficiency &#8211; one for tops, one for pants, swim trunks, one for socks and underwear and one small one to carry all those miscellaneous things (first aid, drugs, spare items). Mine are in different colours to easily identify.<br \/>\nSupposedly 40l, this backpack has no padding next to the back, minimal padding on the shoulder straps and no waist belt. It is just a large sack that can only be accessed through the top (some people don&#8217;t like this).<br \/>\nI carry inside everything for complete travel: light shoes, sleeping pad, sleeping bag, hair trimmer, pack cover, binoculars, silk sleep sheet, pillow case, shoulder bag, plus all my clothes and toiletry.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nDeuter Futura Vario<\/strong> 50 litre +10 &#8211; the best pack in the world if one wants to go on longer treks where a suspension system is necessary. It is so good, I also purchased the 60 +10 pack for longer treks. Whether to use a rolling suitcase, travel pack or backpack for your travel luggage involves many personal decisions. But if you are going to trek or walk much with your luggage, a proper lightweight pack is mandatory for maximum carrying comfort.<br \/>\nThe Deuter Futura suspension system has VariFit, which allows for optimal weight transfer onto the hip belt and perfect positioning of the shoulder straps. It has a continuous adjustment of the back length. The pivoting hip belt follows complex body movements to provide freedom of movement. Contoured shoulder straps with a sternum strap and infinite adjustment of compression straps and stabilizer straps enable a perfect fit. There is great ventilation with full-length mesh that decreases sweating by 25%.<br \/>\nThe pack has many great features: lots of pockets (zippered front opening, bottom compartment with removable separator, 2 large side pockets, 2 pockets in the lid, 2 pockets on the hip belt). The large main compartment can be accessed from the top or can be completely opened from the front. An extendable lid increases storage volume by 10 litres in the backpack. There are many great features: built-in rain cover, hiking pole and ice axe loops and a hydration system. Big enough to carry everything for cold climates but not so big that you can buy many souvenirs. It&#8217;s perfect for trekking.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nPack cover<\/strong>: This is necessary to keep things clean, especially in dirty luggage storage in buses. Saves the built-in rain cover.<br \/>\n<strong>Combo Locks<\/strong> (eBags TSA Accepted Lock 4-Dial Combo): Use for lockers and while sleeping on trains or buses &#8211; one to lock my valuables in a section of my bag and the other to lock my bag to something secure.<br \/>\nCheap plastic zip ties can also be used for security. Tie them up to seat legs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Daypack<\/strong>: A pack with no padding (light, no bulk, and they often fit into their top pocket) is best. Serves as a day pack (carries travel guide, Kindle, computer, umbrella, sunscreen, water, snacks) and at night on air-conditioned buses (sleeping bag, down jacket, socks, travel books, headlight, TP, toothbrush, water, food, pillowcase).<br \/>\nThere are several of these on Amazon &#8211; the <em>Gonex 35l, New Outlander, and Zomake <\/em>are some of the brands of these virtually identical packs. With a front pocket, small zipper pocket, and interior sleeve, it carries a lot. Construction is very robust. The only negative is that the waterproof coating on the interior of the material frays.<br \/>\n<strong>Shoulder bag<\/strong>: I also have a shoulder bag (again, no padding) purchased at Decathlon. It is more convenient than a day pack in my usual walkabouts in large cities. It doesn&#8217;t have to be checked in museums.<br \/>\n<strong>Fanny Belt.<\/strong> Padless and also purchased at Decathlon. I rarely use this.<br \/>\n<strong>Money belt<\/strong>: I rarely use a money belt as I find it uncomfortable and hot around my waist. Use pants with zipper pockets that hold my passport and wallet, and distribute my money around several pockets. Or better yet, have a <strong>secret<\/strong> <strong>inside pocket<\/strong> sewn into pants and shorts.<br \/>\n<strong>Umbrella<\/strong>: The only thing to have in the rain. I skip a rain jacket. The usual comment is about wind &#8211; I have used it hiking and traveling for 50 years, and rarely has wind been an issue. Walking in driving rain is avoided. A good quality umbrella inverts rarely. When on the Camino, rain was often intermittent and an umbrella was much better than taking a rain jacket off and on.<br \/>\n<strong>Sleeping bag<\/strong>: The Western Mountaineering Mitilite is the perfect travel sleeping bag as the high-quality down packs down to a very small size. Warm to +4C. I have slept in it to -10C with extra clothes on. Zips out to make a great comforter. Mates with their Summer Coupler for two people to sleep together with 2 sleeves for sleeping pads. I sleep very warm, and the blankets in many beds are too hot. As a result, I use this almost every night.<br \/>\n<strong>Sleep sheet<\/strong>: essential as some accommodation has only one sheet or none, or dirty sheets. The silk\/cotton blend or pure silk (warmest) is very comfortable. Keeps your sleeping bag clean, and may give some protection from bed bugs and mosquitos. The Rab silk sleep sheet is great with the smallest pack size and a fold-over for a pillow.<br \/>\n<strong>Pillow<\/strong>: A small polyester pillowcase with a fold-over top sold in hiking stores for backpacking. Stuff with a down jacket and other clothes.<br \/>\n<strong>Sleeping mat.<\/strong> I first bought the Thermarest Uber light (550gm, fits into a 12oz drinking cup but it is very fragile and easily develops leaks that I could never find. Now, I use the <strong><em>Nemo<\/em><\/strong> pad, which is much stronger and only slightly bigger.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CLOTHES<\/strong> You can always buy clothing anywhere and buy T-shirts as souvenirs. Laundromats are available in every city and are most often organized through your hotel. I use antiperspirants like Drysol, never get body odor and use far fewer clothes. Use a layering system for maximum efficiency.<br \/>\n<strong>Hiking shoes<\/strong>, low-cut: Any brand with stiffer soles (essential for extra support if walking lots) and a large toe box are essential features. I usually buy ones with a waterproof liner like Gortex XCR. Broken-in shoes can be a life-saver, especially on long walks like the Camino de Santiago. Refer to my post, Treatment of Blisters with tips on buying shoes that fit.<br \/>\n<strong>Flip-flops<\/strong>: Chacos are the best flop-flops with a formed footbed. Read the post on flips. I wear them 12 months per year, almost 100% of the time. A problem with flip-flops is the heavy callus that develops on heels and will produce painful cracks (use a Microplane grater to deal with this).<br \/>\n<strong>Socks<\/strong> &#8211; 2 wicking polyester liner socks used when hiking &#8211; double socks are one of the best ways to prevent blisters, 1-2 thick hiking socks, 2 light ankle height, 1 with toes for flip-flops<br \/>\n<strong>Nylon shorts<\/strong> with zippered pockets or sewn-in interior pocket.<br \/>\n<strong>Long nylon pants<\/strong> with zip-off legs, zippered pockets and sewn-in interior secret pocket.<br \/>\n<strong>Long cotton\/khaki or nylon pants<\/strong>. Inside pocket.<br \/>\n<strong>Bathing suit<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Belt<\/strong> &#8211; Nylon with plastic buckle &#8211; never has to be removed in airports. Buy one with a hidden zipper for that emergency $200.<br \/>\n<strong>Underwear<\/strong> &#8211; 3-5 merino or cotton boxer shorts were my favourite, but I&#8217;ve found better.<br \/>\nI seem to be constantly in search of the perfect underwear. I\u2019ve tried everything but I always favour boxer-type underwear. Merino wicks, is cool in warm environments and doesn&#8217;t absorb odours, but they are expensive and wear very poorly.<br \/>\n2UNDR or SHEATHUNDERWEAR (and many others) are two brands of very supportive underwear. These are the most comfortable underwear ever and are half the price of Merino. Soft and very supportive, they\u2019re like a party in your pants.<br \/>\nThese are engineered to structurally hold everything up in a pouch to isolate your privates from your thighs. This prevents unwanted skin contact, decreases sweating, and produces a cool environment. A compression-fit blend of polyester\/spandex. A good roll-resistant band. Flatlocked stitching<br \/>\n<strong>Tops<\/strong> &#8211; Originally, I used 2-4 cotton t-shirts, 1 long-sleeved, but I have converted to light polyester sports tops.<br \/>\n<strong>Long-sleeved zip T poly tops<\/strong> &#8211; 1 for cooler climates, great for hiking. Merino preferable.<br \/>\n<strong>Synthetic long-sleeved shirt<\/strong>. Or dress shirt for when you need to dress up. I have an Icebreaker Merino shirt.<br \/>\n<strong>Light fleece top or hoodie. <\/strong>Not necessary with a puff jacket.<br \/>\n<strong>Marmot Dri clime<\/strong>: A light nylon shell with a light synthetic liner.<br \/>\n<strong>Rain jacket<\/strong>: Marmot Precip or similar with no liner that adds unnecessary bulk. I now rarely carry a jacket using an umbrella for rain.<br \/>\n<strong>Puff jacket<\/strong>: High-quality (800+) down. Stores in own pocket, small and warm. Patagonia 800 fill down.<br \/>\n<strong>Puff vest.\u00a0<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Baseball hat<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Bandana<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Toque (Canadian for wool cap), Outdoor Research Versaliner gloves <\/strong>(finger glove liner waterproof, windproof and breathable nylon outer glove that stores in a zipper pocket on the back of the gloves. For cold climates.<br \/>\n<strong>Silicon bags<\/strong> 4 small for dividing up clothes. 1 medium bag for dirty clothes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CLOTHES FOR HOT CLIMATES.<\/strong> On my West Africa trip from Morocco to Cape Town, I made terrible choices and bought very little that was appropriate for the heat and humidity on most of the trip. I bought too many pairs of long pants and never wore the two pairs once. I was prepared for wearing them at night when mosquitoes (and thus malaria) should have been a problem. But I am very insect tolerant, and mosquitoes are surprisingly rare (it was winter and not the rainy season for most of the trip). This was the most insect-free place I have ever been. Mosquitoes were much less of a problem than I imagined and I didn\u2019t use repellants for weeks at a time, no less clothing to cover up (this may not be so for others and some people used repellants and put on long pants, long-sleeved tops and wore socks every night, but I don\u2019t react much to bites). They were most problematic in big cities with standing water and were nonexistent when we were at any elevation, which was most of the time. I should have bought more shorts \u2013 strong, dark-coloured nylon with sewn-in inside pockets is much better than cotton.<br \/>\nCotton t-shirts and long tops are terrible in the heat and humidity. Light polyester tops, especially those vented for running, and the lightest Merino wool tops are much more serviceable. Merino is especially good as it does not acquire odours but is expensive and wears poorly. One long-sleeved shirt might be useful. Socks are a waste of time as I wear flip-flops 99% of the time. A fleece top or puff jacket was useful in Morocco and for early starts when the windows were rolled up. They were necessary again in South Africa.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HYGIENE<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Razor and spare blades<\/strong> (store in a separate plastic bag as rust easily),<br \/>\n<strong>Shave cream<\/strong>: Probably not necessary, as bar soap works fine. Gel is best. Often taken at immigration.<br \/>\n<strong>Toothbrush<\/strong> with holder, toothpaste, floss. Ultrasonic brush great for gum health &#8211; the Philips Sonicare comes in a case so it can recharge with a USB port. Dental brushes are useful for bridges, but a Waterpik works best.<br \/>\n<strong>Hair brush<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>S<\/strong><strong>oap box, bar soap<\/strong>. Use one of the small lock boxes for a soap box.<br \/>\n<strong>Shampoo<\/strong>, conditioner. In small, strong plastic bottles. Head &amp; Shoulders is my standby. Lush Solid Shampoo takes up little space and won\u2019t leak over your bag.<br \/>\n<strong>Nail scissors<\/strong>, sharp scissors, mirror, tweezers, nail clippers, hair ties<br \/>\n<strong>Drysol<\/strong>: The only antiperspirant to use. Completely prevents BO. Use once per week. Deodorant is not necessary. Shower less often. Clothes never smell so can wear them for several days. Reduces the need for laundry.<br \/>\n<strong>Sunscreen<\/strong>: Ombrelle Sport 30, alcohol base so not greasy.<br \/>\n<strong>Lip moisturizer<\/strong> with sunscreen<br \/>\n<strong>Towel. <\/strong>Microfiber towel, but they smell.<br \/>\n<strong>Microplane grater<\/strong>: Wearing flip-flops results in a thick callus that develops painful cracks. I used to use a pumice stone to control it but I have since used a microplanar grater. They are commonly sold as zesters. Incredibly efficient.<\/p>\n<p><strong>FIRST AID<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Ibuprofen<\/strong>. The best simple pain reliever. I call it Vitamin I.<br \/>\n<strong>Cortisone cream, antifungal cream. <\/strong>Polysporin (neomycin, antifungal, cortisone combination.<br \/>\n<strong>Drugs<\/strong>: antibiotics (amoxicillin, Levofloxacin) and antimalarials (CoArtem 3-day treatment &#8211; 2 courses (no prophylaxis).<br \/>\n<strong>First Aid &#8211;<\/strong> Bandaids, Kling, steri strips, variety Bandaids<br \/>\n<strong>Blister care<\/strong>: moleskin or duct tape<\/p>\n<p><strong>ACCESSORIES<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Headlight<\/strong>: Petzyl Zipca smallest spare batteries<br \/>\n<strong>Compass<\/strong>: very useful to find your way around and orientate yourself to a map, esp. at night, in the smog of China, or places where you cannot see the sun to orient yourself.<br \/>\n<strong>Knife<\/strong>: Leatherman or Swiss Army Knife. Not possible in a carry-on.<br \/>\n<strong>Alarm clock<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Watch<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Utensils<\/strong>: bowl, cup, knife, spoon, chopsticks: Useful in countries where breakfast not supplied. Essential if you are a coffee addict.<br \/>\n<strong>Water bottle<\/strong>: can usually be left at home. End up buying bottled water most places.<br \/>\n<strong>Steripen<\/strong> water purifier: rarely use as end up buying water most places. Buy one with rechargeable batteries or one that takes AA batteries. Buy bottled water.<br \/>\n<strong>Inflatable neck pillow<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Sleeping &#8211; earplugs, eye cover<\/strong>. Essential for noisy dorm rooms with snorers. Consider custom earplugs that really work. Try Moldex 6604 Sparkplugs Earplugs, the official earplugs of Nascar or Mack&#8217;s Ear Seals &#8211; washable and reusable.<br \/>\n<strong>Sunglasses<\/strong> with strap, case and cleaning cloth.<br \/>\n<strong>Ziplock plastic bags<\/strong>: at least 10 sandwich-size bags, 2-3 medium. Great for holding all sorts of things<br \/>\n<strong>Medium-sized silicon bag<\/strong> for dirty clothes.<br \/>\n<strong>Rubber doorstop.<\/strong> If you have a private room, you\u2019ll have a lock, but shoving a doorstop beneath the door will make it difficult for people to enter your room. Just in case.<br \/>\n<strong>Universal drain stopper.<\/strong> Do the laundry, and have a sink bath.<br \/>\n<strong>Clothes Line.<\/strong> The twisted cord type is very useful as it can avoid clothespins.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ELECTRONICS\u00a0<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Electrical adaptors<\/strong> appropriate for countries traveling in. Universal one with USB adapter best as covers everywhere. As I am now using a Mac Air 13&#8243;, I am using the Apple charging set &#8211; larger but much more functional.<br \/>\n<strong>Power bank.<\/strong> 28000mA. Light. Anker makes the best banks.<br \/>\n<strong>Solar charger.<\/strong> Big Blue 28Watt. The output current is displayed. Suitable for phones and small devices, but power banks charge very slowly and not for laptop computers.<br \/>\n<strong>Smart phone<\/strong>: A smartphone is invaluable at times especially to use Google Maps, Google Translate, camera, the many travel apps out there and as a phone!<br \/>\n<strong>Camera<\/strong>: I normally don&#8217;t travel with one. Camera phone or compact digital all that is necessary for most everyone.<br \/>\n<strong>Computer<\/strong>: essential if writing a blog. Pays for itself by avoiding Internet cafes. MacBook Air 13&#8243;. Graphite case?. Mouse?. DVD player?.<br \/>\n<strong>Amazon Kindle<\/strong>: My most valuable travel possession (I have left this to the last as I have written more about it).<br \/>\nYou may be fixed on paper books, but for travel, not carrying around a bunch of books makes life on the road so much easier. And you have access to any book ever written \u2013 read what most interests you rather than relying on what you find in your last hostel where many books are in a language you don\u2019t understand. You can still support your local bookstore at home.<br \/>\nI am a prolific reader, and travel gives you so much time to read on planes, trains, and in waiting rooms, on the beach, and evenings in guesthouses without much to do. I also have four magazine subscriptions (Time, Atlantic, Economist and National Geographix). Newspapers are also available.<br \/>\nA Kindle handles PDFs as well and can even be used for email. I can read more than one book at a time.<br \/>\n<em>Choosing a Kindle.<\/em> There are several different models of Kindles (and quite a few non-Kindle e-readers out there that are probably great, but I don\u2019t have the expertise to review them). My personal pick is the Paperwhite for one major reason: the frontlight, an internal white light with adjustable brightness. Read on dimly lit buses, planes, and trains and in dark hostel rooms. Front-lit screens are easier on the eyes with prolonged reading. The Kindle Fire has a backlit screen, which can cause eyestrain the same way as an iPad or computer monitor.<br \/>\n<em>Other Kindle Tips.<\/em> Buy a cover: it protects it against damage (I am now on Kindle #11 as I have fractured so many screens when I didn\u2019t use the cover) and acts as a bit of camouflage against would-be thieves. If your Kindle becomes unusable because of damage, you can get a new one by courier in about 5 days anywhere. As long as it is less than one year old, new ones are free. The battery life of Kindles is insane, recharging every week or two.<br \/>\n<em>How to Read Kindle Books for Free.<\/em> Kindle books can be pricey, especially as they are intangible. 1. Check Amazon for their Daily Deals. 2. Your local library may have a Kindle lending library. 3. Amazon\u2019s Family Library allows you to share your Kindle books between two adults and up to four children. Choose anyone with similar tastes to your own. 4. Become an Amazon Prime member to \u201cborrow\u201d one free book a month from the Kindle Lending Library. The selection is not very good, but once in a while, something is interesting. 5. Many classic books considered to be in the public domain are available for free. Amazon rotates their offerings and Project Guttenberg has over 50,000 public domain books. 6. The Internet Archive has the amazing Harvard Classics: https\/\/archive.org\/details\/harvardclassics 7. Download it for free. Acquire them on your computer and mail them to your kindle email address.<br \/>\n<strong>Wireless headphones<\/strong>. Noise cancelling headphones.<br \/>\n<strong>Plug-in inverter.<\/strong> For electronics that don&#8217;t charge with a USB (Mac Air and most computers, rechargeable batteries). It will drain the car battery. I bought a tiny one on Amazon.<\/p>\n<p><strong>PAPER<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Passport<\/strong> with visas and vaccination certificates. Consider carrying it in a protective waterproof &#8220;case&#8221;. If wet, the electronic strip can become damaged, or your front page photo may make you unrecognizable.<br \/>\n<strong>Wallet<\/strong>: small with debit card, credit card, wallet card (has every bit of information in my life + all my passwords.<br \/>\n<strong>Spare debit and credit cards<\/strong>: it is not unusual to lose or get a card locked. Two extra of each essential for that long trip. Store it in a second wallet with other cards.<br \/>\n<strong>Driver&#8217;s license<\/strong> and International Drivers License. Necessary to rent a car. Second picture ID. It can be left as security instead of a passport. Necessary for your travel medical insurance if you are injured in an accident.<br \/>\n<strong>$100-200 US or\u00a0\u20ac<\/strong>. Emergency money that can be used anywhere.<br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b>?Guide books. <\/b><\/span>*I no longer use paper guidebooks and create by site list with Nomad Mania.<br \/>\n<strong>Maps<\/strong>: I carry a National Geographic map of the continent I am on and mark my route traveled.<br \/>\n<strong>Notebook<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Pens<\/strong>: ballpoint, highlighter, coloured for drawing the route on maps<br \/>\n<strong>Zippered plastic pouch<\/strong>: for carrying all the paper you accumulate: itineraries, maps, loose-leaf paper for notes and plans<br \/>\n<strong>3 copies<\/strong> &#8211; credit card, debit card, driver&#8217;s license, itineraries, wallet card, passport. Better yet, scan cards and email them to yourself<br \/>\n<strong>Business cards:<\/strong> Great for businesses that travel or anyone tired of writing out their personal contact information all the time. Moo Cards www.moo.com\/uk allows you to upload your own photos (up to 50 of them per order) to the front of your card, as well as a headshot on the back. Good quality and durable, but expensive: for 50 &#8211; 13.19 pounds or 19.36US$, not cheaper for larger quantities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Snorkel and mask, flippers<\/strong>: especially when traveling in tropical countries like SE Asia and the Caribbean and plan on using a great deal<br \/>\n<strong>Mosquito net.<\/strong> It can be freestanding (bulky) or hanging from a tree branch. Impregnated with insecticide. For my West Africa trip, I brought an MSR Hubba one-man tent, much bulkier because of the fly but a complete tent. Too bulky and not used much so I don&#8217;t use one now. I have also used a Big Agnes one-man tent.<br \/>\n<strong>Sleep Pad.\u00a0<\/strong>I find this indispensable for sleeping in airports (which I do a lot. Initially, I used the Thermarest Uberlite Sleeping pad. At 220 gms and the size of a 10-oz glass, it has a nylon bag necessary to inflate the mattress and avoid moisture inside the pad. With a sleep sheet, sleeping bag, pillowcase, eye cover, and earplugs, you can be comfortable anywhere. The Nemo is almost as small and much tougher.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Big Agnes one-man tent.<\/strong> I brought this along for the first months of my 2022 travel and used it a lot to wild camp.

We all have individual needs and preferences but these are the things that worked well be me over many decades of backpacking and kayaking. I was completely happy with my choices.<br \/>\na. Sleeping bags. Temperatures vary from near freezing in Morocco to unbearably hot at night making it impossible to bring the perfect sleeping bag. Warm bags are really only necessary in Morocco and taking anything good for less than 0\u00b0C is overkill. One guy actually bought a -30\u00b0 bag, way too warm for anywhere. I have travelled for many years with a great sleeping bag, the Western Mountaineering MityLite with high quality down, but warm to only 4C. In Morocco, I wore long underwear, warm socks, a warm top and a touque to bed and did fine. Once we got to Western Sahara, this bag was perfect wearing normal bed clothes and by Mauritania, I unzipped it completely and used it as a comforter. Having a -15 degree bag or a mummy bag without a full zipper would not have worked well. Once we got to the heat of Guinea, I rarely used the bag and simply slept in the liner. Another trick at night is to go to bed in wet clothes.<br \/>\nMy +4\u00b0 bag was perfect. With the highest quality down, it packs very small. It is a barrel bag and unzips completely so that it can be used like a duvet which was useful. Buying a cheap blanket would also have worked well to add to the warmth.<br \/>\n<strong>b. Sleep sheet.<\/strong> I always use a liner to keep the bag as clean as possible (my skin never touches the bag) and this adds possibly 2 degrees to the bag. Cotton is preferable as it is cooler than silk. Using a sleeping bag alone is a disaster as they are difficult to clean and they should never be dry cleaned making the liner mandatory. It would have been impossible to wash my down bag before South Africa (down needs a dryer to get all the clumps out). Indeed I have not washed my bag in 6 years as it simply does not touch my skin.<br \/>\n<strong>c. Sleeping mat.<\/strong> I have the best, an Exped Down Mat, the ultimate in sleeping comfort. The Exped is very expensive but well worth it. They are best combined with an inflation system (dry bag with a Snozzle, available from Exped) as hand pumping would get very tiring doing it almost every night. But it is too big to travel with.<br \/>\nThe Thermarest Uber lite initially but Nemo better and only slightly larger. Cheap inflatable mats get punctures easily and often delaminate. A good closed cell foam would have been better but they are way too bulky for me. Something could be said for not bringing an inflatable mat as leaks are common and can be difficult to repair without a bathtub to find the leak. Bring a good repair kit.<br \/>\n<strong>d. Tent.<\/strong>\u00a0On my Africa west coast trip, I was the only one with my own tent, a MSR Hubba (free standing one-man tent), virtually identical to the free-standing mosquito nets encouraged by Oasis, but with a fly and able to stand up to most weather. It was one of the best things I bought. It is that erects quickly, dries quickly and allows you to sit up in it. It was a tough pack having to bring a sleeping pad, sleeping bag and a tent (or stand alone mosquito net) and everything needed for 6 months of travel in a 50l backpack.<br \/>\nWhen in Europe in 2018, I purchased a MSR Hubba Hubba NX, the lightweight version of their 2-man tent and used it on a 4 day trek in Iceland.<br \/>\nBig Agnes one-man tent. This is my favourite because of its lightness and small volume.<br \/>\n<em>Pillow.<\/em> I always carry a small backpacking pillow case that I normally stuff with my down puff jacket and other clothes. I purchased a small pillow in Morocco that fitted perfectly in this pillow case again making camping much more comfortable.<br \/>\n<em>Clothes pegs.<\/em> As all our clothes washing was done by hand, these are mandatory to hang them up. A rope line is also necessary.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>TRAVEL LIST This list is modified according to destination.
