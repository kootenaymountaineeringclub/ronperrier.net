Then the road rises to about 150m above the south side of Lemon Creek and descends to much nearer the creek the rest of the way to the trail, always on the S side for 16 km.

Join the Lemon Creek FSR before the trailhead.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Trail:<\/strong> Begin up an old road for about 1 km. The old original trail is at the road\u2019s end and from here, the relaxing 6.4 km of gentle trail rises up the valley passing giant cedars and hemlocks. There are many creek crossings so be wary of frost and wet bark.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The trail is not maintained and thus has deadfall.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The trail steepens sharply before the valley&#8217;s towering headwall. Start several switchbacks up to the crest. Within 1.6km, the trail crosses Lemon Creek where it cascades down the steep slope. This bridge has been washed out for many years &#8211; and as a result, this approach to Glory Basin is not used much.<br \/>\nThere are several options to deal with the washout if you have come this far or plan on hiking this way.<br \/>\n1. Follow the normal trail and try to cross the creek at the best place. Lemon Creek would be difficult to wade until later in the season. There is also less water early in the morning. The banks of the creek here are difficult because of the concrete-hard, steep walls formed by the steep creek. Crampons might be useful! but have an axe and someone to help.<br \/>\n2. Stay on the north side of Lemon Creek. Instead of crossing, skirt under the cliffs of the headwall to the north. Cross where it is easy between the Sapphire Lakes. If coming down Lemon Creek, cross on top and stay on the right (north) side. This is probably the best way.<br \/>\n3. Instead of crossing to the north side down the valley, stay on the south side of the creek and attack this side of the headwall. I have come down this way and it is no fun. Anything is possible with determination. The north side is easier.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">From the brim, there are splendid views down the valley.\u00a0<\/span>Another .8km leads to a ramshackle cabin, a reminder of old gold, silver and lead mining activities. These claims, known as the Silver Crest Group, were worked sporadically until the early 1920s. The cabin was last home to Mr McCleod, his family and 8 miners who worked the open cuts high on the ridge to the east in the summer of 1921.\u00a0 <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Beyond the cabin, ascend meadows to the Lower &amp; Upper Sapphire Lakes (9.6 km, 6 miles total), crystal tarns at the northwest end of a vast alpine basin &#8211; Glory Basin. Their cool blue waters invite the photographer and, in summer, the hardy swimmer. The campground at Sapphire Lakes is closed. It is a very fragile area.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The two Sapphire Lakes sit in Lemon Pass at 2271m, 7450 feet. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>What to do?<br \/>\n<\/strong>1. <strong>Glory Basin.<\/strong> From Sapphire Lakes, it can take a half day just to explore Glory Basin. The basin climbs three kilometres south to the Sunshine \/ Outlook col (2337m 7850 feet). East to west it is about 2 km wide at the level of the lakes and narrows to about a kilometre in width at its south end. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">2. Most of the day will be required to climb all the summits on the south end &#8211; all a short climb less than an hour from the basin: <strong>Sunshine Mt<\/strong> (2601m 8533&#8242;), <strong>Outlook Mt<\/strong> (2591m 8479&#8242;) and <strong>Mount John Carter<\/strong> (2602m 8540&#8242;) one km NNE of Outlook on the east edge of the basin.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">3. <strong>Mt Giegerich<\/strong> (2438m 8000&#8242;) is 1km NW of Sapphire Lakes. Beyond is a long ridge extending to the northwest towards Enterprise Pass: Mt Giegerich, <strong>Nansen Mt<\/strong> (2469m 8100&#8242;), <strong>Mt Robert Smith<\/strong> (2470m 8104&#8242;) and Boomerang Mt (8210;). <strong>Boomerang<\/strong> is normally climbed from Enterprise Creek and Heather Lake. Climb <strong>Mt Robert Smith and Nansen<\/strong> from Timber Creek.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">4. From Sapphire Lakes (Lemon Pass) <strong>Kaslo Lake<\/strong> and the core area of Kokanee Glacier PP is 3.2 km more &#8211; all downhill.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">5. <strong>Nilsik Creek trail<\/strong>. From the Sunshine \/ Outlook Col, this route can be difficult to find and follow. From the top, the trail begins high and to the right. The start of the Nilsik Creek Trail is 2.4 km (1.5 miles) from the car.<br \/>\n6. <strong>Ski Lemon Creek to Six Mile:<\/strong> Sometimes the roads on either end are plowed giving access to high points. But usually, skidoos track the route regularly making for easy skiing over the pass.
