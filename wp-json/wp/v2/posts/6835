The town was established in the 1880s as an ideal location for fruit growing, and it was extraordinary. It was located on a creek delta of rich soil and shielded from cold winds by the surrounding mountains. It was the ideal location for orchards in the region and was known for cherries, apples, pears and peaches. Originally named Dog Creek, the Mennonite settlers living there wanted a new moniker that would capture the spirit of their little farming community. Once they agreed on Renata, the first baby born shared that name.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Without electricity,\u00a0it was connected\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0rest\u00a0of civilization\u00a0by\u00a0a\u00a0three-car\u00a0ferry\u00a0and\u00a0a nearly\u00a0impassable\u00a0dirt\u00a0road that climbed up to the Kettle Valley Railway.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The Mennonite settlement in Renata began in 1907, when Frank F. Siemens from Altona, Manitoba, representing the Western Land Company, attracted 20 families from Herbert and Rosthern, Saskatchewan and southern Manitoba to take up land in the area. Several families were families from near Rosthern, Saskatchewan. Climatic and agricultural conditions were favourable and eventually, there were about 50 homes in this settlement. The main occupation of the settlers was fruit farming. Many Mennonites left Renata by the 1950s, leaving only about 10 Mennonite families. The government didn\u2019t want to provide services such as electricity, and it was getting to the point where they would have to do that if anyone stayed, so they wanted everybody out. There were mixed feelings within the population, but there was one common denominator: grief. Some people said, \u2018You know, there has to be progress.\u2019 For a lot of people, their bone to pick was more about how it was done than the fact that it was done.\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> It is impossible\u00a0to\u00a0say\u00a0whether\u00a0the people\u00a0involved\u00a0were\u00a0ever\u00a0truly compensated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">In the mid-1960s the community was relocated when the Hugh Keenleyside Dam flooded the valley and completely submerged the village. Renata\u00a0was\u00a0one\u00a0of\u00a0many\u00a0communities that\u00a0disappeared\u00a0following\u00a0the\u00a0Columbia River\u00a0Treaty.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> Depending on the water level you will find it either completely underwater or completely razed with the occasional house foundation and the remains of the orchard, almost as if it was never there at all.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> The\u00a0graveyard was\u00a0covered\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0slab\u00a0of\u00a0concrete\u00a0and\u00a0unmarked.\u00a0Residents\u00a0have\u00a0since\u00a0returned\u00a0to\u00a0place\u00a0a\u00a0plaque there\u00a0to\u00a0keep\u00a0their\u00a0memories\u00a0alive,\u00a0but\u00a0it\u00a0too\u00a0is\u00a0underwater\u00a0for\u00a0most\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0year.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This is a lovely waterfall that cascades delicately down about 10 metres over a rock ledge to a small pool guarded by huge rounded, granite boulders in a box canyon.
