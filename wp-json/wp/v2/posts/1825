Made up of 19 museums and galleries and a National Zoological Park. A visit requires at least three days of your time and some military-grade organisational skills. The information centre can help you plan but it\u2019s generally acknowledged that the museums of Natural History, the American Indian, American History, and Air and Space are not to be missed. Here\u2019s what\u2019s hot at the Natural History Museum: the \u2018Hope Diamond\u2019, the 8-tonne model of an African elephant, the Neanderthal man reconstructions, the mummies, and the live coral reef. At the American Indian Museum don\u2019t miss the Navajo paintings and the photographs by Leuman M Waugh. Get a taste of American History by seeing Edison\u2019s light bulb, George Washington\u2019s uniform and Dorothy\u2019s red slippers. Finish your whistle-stop tour at the Air and Space museum where you\u2019ll see planes piloted by both the Wright brothers and Amelia Earhart, an Apollo command module, and a model of Star Trek\u2019s USS Enterprise.<br \/>\n2. <strong>Whitney Plantation<\/strong>. 5099 Louisiana Highway 19, Wallace, Louisiana. www.whitneyplantation.com<br \/>\nNot every museum tells a happy story. This is one such place. However despite the serious subject matter this is a fascinating, illuminating and historically significant memorial to the practice of slavery in America. The museum began as a passion project of trial attorney John Cummings and his director of research, Ibrahima Seck. Cummings spent 16 years and close to US$8 million of his personal fortune to build the museum and educate visitors on the realities of slavery and its impact on modern America. This is an open-air museum, a 1700-acre property designed to allow visitors to experience the world of an 1830s sugar plantation through the eyes of the enslaved people who lived and worked here. There are restored plantation buildings, including the French-Creole main house, slave quarters and cages. One of the most moving exhibits is the recorded stories of residents of the plantation.<br \/>\n3. <strong>American Classic Arcade Museum<\/strong>. 579 Endicott St N, Laconia, New Hampshire. www.classicarcademuseum.org<br \/>\nThey\u2019re so addictive.

So many, it\u2019s hard to talk about it. Pac-Man is calling me, Tetris, Star Wars, Frogger, Galaga, Pole Position, Donkey Kong, the list goes on and on and on. There are around 300 arcade and pinball machines in the collection. It\u2019s the arcade of your life history, every pimply period of your gaming life covered. Play every game and relive all those high moments of teenage fame.<br \/>\n4. <strong>Burlesque Hall of Fame<\/strong>. 520 Fremont St, Las Vegas. www.burlesquehall.com<br \/>\nOnly in Las Vegas. Actually, this museum used to be on the site of an abandoned goat farm in California, but we\u2019re thinking those bucolic surrounds didn\u2019t sit well with the museum\u2019s subject matter. So it swiftly moved to the bright lights of America\u2019s sin city. Despite the exotic connotations, the once-private collection of retired dancer Jennie Lee is a fascinating historical account of the evolution of burlesque in America. Covering the early 19th century to the present day, the collection is a celebration of burlesque as art \u2013 the comedy, dance, music and costume \u2013 more than it is a glimpse into erotica. If you want to see burlesque in action you can head to any one of the numerous casinos on Las Vegas\u2019 iconic Strip or beyond. But if you want an insight into its famed costumes, jewellery, choreography, pioneering performers and much more, then you\u2019re in the right place here.<br \/>\n5. <strong>Grammy Museum.<\/strong>. 800 W Olympic Blvd, Los Angeles. www.grammymuseum.org<br \/>\nRock, pop, R&#038;B, hip hop\u2026here there\u2019s no stone left unturned. There are 160 genres of music to explore right from the get-go. It\u2019s a powerhouse museum, thoughtful, creative and engaging. It\u2019ll reignite your love of music and your admiration for those who make it. Go, explore! If you have an interest in music, you\u2019re going to be blown away by this place. Creating music, recording music, the stars themselves, the instruments they play\u2026you can see, experience, hear and touch your way through decades of popular culture as revealed through music. There are special exhibits as well, often focusing on particular artists, so you could visit a few times and experience something different on each occasion.<br \/>\n6. <strong>Musical Instruments Museum<\/strong>. 4725 E Mayo Blvd, Phoenix, Arizona. www.nim.org<br \/>\nThis Phoenix-based museum stakes its claim as one of the best by showcasing musical instruments from every country in the world. There are more than 15,000 instruments on display throughout five geographically arranged galleries. From an antique European charter horn to mechanical zithers to the iconic modern-day Fender guitar and everything in between. There\u2019s also an entire gallery devoted to world-famous artists. You can see instruments played by Elvis, John Lennon, Johnny Cash, cellist Pablo Casals and Taylor Swift. Visitors are given the opportunity to speak the language in the \u2018Experience\u2019 gallery: try your hand at playing guitars, Southeast Asian tribal drums, Japanese gongs \u2013 and even the quirky, electronic theremin.<br \/>\n7. <strong>Bicycle Museum of America<\/strong>. 7 W Monroe, New Bremen, Ohio. www.bicylemuseum.com<br \/>\nThis museum combines great exhibits and interested, interesting staff \u2013 before you know it, you\u2019ll be a spoke spotter yourself. The museum has a couple of hundred years of bicycle history covered. There are 300 bicycles on display and many, many more on rotation. Bicycles have come a long way since their mysterious first appearance (there\u2019s no verified claim to \u2018inventor of the bicycle\u2019). From the awkward big front wheel of penny farthings to the tough (tuff?) stability of a BMX, you won\u2019t believe the designs that have pedalled out of showrooms over the years. And you can see many of them here. The curators reckon that with about 1000 bikes in the collection, you\u2019ll probably see your own first machine here; prepare for a little nostalgia as you recall that first tumble off your bike&#8230;\u201d<br \/>\n8. <strong>Exploratorium<\/strong>. Pier 15, The Embarcadero, San Francisco. www.exploratorium.edu<br \/>\nThe stated mission of the Exploratorium is to \u2018change the way the world learns\u2019. It\u2019s a funhouse full of experiential science experiments; an immersive journey into the world of physics, human behaviour, and living systems. The museum, originally set up by Frank Oppenheimer (younger brother of Robert Oppenheimer, of atomic-bomb fame), is designed to encourage informal learning by allowing direct participation in the exhibits. Since the museum opened, there have been over 1000 participatory displays \u2013 600 of which are open to the public at any one time. Tackle the Tactile Dome \u2013 a pitch-black chamber that asks you to crawl, slide and bump your way through using only your sense of touch. Or explore the Monochromatic Room \u2013 a colourless world lit like an old sepia photograph. In the Tinkering Studio you can do things like make clothing out of old plastic, take apart your favourite toy, build digital jewellery or make electrical circuits on flat paper. Endless entertainment that just happens to make you smarter.<br \/>\n9. <strong>New Mexico Museum of Space History<\/strong>. 3198 State Rte 2001, Alamogordo, New Mexico. wwwnmspacemuseum.org<br \/>\nRocket sleds, space shuttles, satellites, suits&#8230;in the middle of the New Mexico desert in a space-age (ie \u201970s!) building. This region was home to a significant amount of development work for the space program. And, you know, Roswell is just 100 miles away: there\u2019s heritage here. Did you know Ham, the astrochimp, first ape in space, is buried here? He lived out his retirement in a zoo in Washington \u2013 nothing adventurous. But he\u2019s an inspiring little guy. There are four floors of exhibits and they will keep you busy. There are exhibitions on what it\u2019s like to live and work in space; there\u2019s a section on the history and development of rocketry. And the Space Hall of Fame remembers and celebrates the crazy, er, brave men and women who have dedicated their lives to exploring space. It\u2019s a blast!<br \/>\n10. <strong>New York City Fire Museum<\/strong>. 278 Spring St, New York City. www.nycfiremuseum.org<br \/>\nThe deal is almost 400 years of fire-fighting history brought to life with equipment and stories. New York\u2019s big-city nature was there from the start; many people and many buildings in a small space meant fires had catastrophic potential. This museum celebrates their bravery, most notably in its 9\/11 memorial to the 343 who lost their lives that day. It\u2019s also staffed by retired firefighters who can provide first-hand accounts of an NYC fireman\u2019s working life. Fire engines! Hand-pumper engines, horse-drawn carriages, motorised \u2013 you name it, they got it! Plus all the tools of the trade \u2013 tell me you\u2019re not keen to see the Jaws of Life in action. The museum also aims to educate its visitors on fire prevention.<br \/>\n11. <strong>Clown Hall of Fame &#038; Research Centre<\/strong>. 102 4th St, Baraboo, Wisconsin. www.theclownmuseum.com<br \/>\nIt\u2019s safe to say that this museum is certainly not for those who suffer from coulrophobia (fear of clowns).<br \/>\nThe Hall of Fame celebrates the art of clowning and all the antics and historical significance that go with it. There are performances from actual clowns during the scheduled tours. This clowning stuff is serious business. The museum documents clowns through the ages, from the earliest circus performers to representations of clowns in modern TV and cinema. There\u2019s particular mention of famous and long-standing members of the clowning elite \u2013 25 years\u2019 experience in the industry is needed in order to even be considered as an inductee into the Clown Hall of Fame. You remember Nat Wills, the Happy Tramp? Or Bruce Johnson, the Juggling Clown? Perhaps not, but that won\u2019t matter; the scores of fantastic photos and detailed historical footage is endearing and entirely entertaining.<br \/>\n12. <strong>International Cryptozoology Museum<\/strong>. 11 Avon St, Portland, Maine. www.cryptozoologymuseuim.com<br \/>\nThe name makes it sound like a museum dedicated to death \u2013 au contraire, this place is a celebration of life. If you ever had any doubt about the existence of Bigfoot, or the yeti, or even the elusive Iceman, this museum will make you\u2026 well, slightly less doubtful. Cryptozoology is the \u2018study of hidden animals\u2019, from the Greek word \u2018kryptos\u2019, meaning hidden. Here, at the world\u2019s only cryptozoology museum (we know, the only one \u2013 weird, right?) there are exhibits including \u2018actual hair samples\u2019 from the Abominable Snowman and foecal matter from everyone\u2019s favourite elusive cryptid, Bigfoot, but also displays about our lesser-known rare and extinct creatures like the coelacanth and thylacine. That\u2019s a type of fish and the Tasmanian tiger, for those not up on their strange creatures knowledge. It\u2019s totally kid-friendly. The life-sized sculptures of the Crookston Bigfoot, for example, and life-like models of a Sasquatch baby and FeeJee Mermaid are more fun than freaky.<\/p>\n<p><strong>COSTA RICA<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Unesco:<\/strong> 1.

Guatemala Basin (9 degrees North) &#8211; In the eastern Pacific between Mexico and the Galapagos, is an immense chain of underwater volcanos that produce superheated water at temperatures of more than 400C and a toxic mineral cocktail. Clouds of sulphides solidify into towering chimneys as tall as a 3-story house. It is home to some 50 species of incredible marine life including giant tubeworms, the world&#8217;s fastest-growing marine invertebrates that reach astounding lengths. Bacteria live at the razor-thin interface between the extremely hot and the very cold water. They can photosythesise in the absence of sunlight, using nothing more than the dim light coming from the hydrothermal vents. Only a few can come here &#8211; a degree in marine biology or oceanography plus training in deep sea exploration and the engineering of manned submersibles, Spanish language.<br \/>\nOcean vents are typically located near areas of tectonic plate movement known as ocean ridges. Below ocean depths of about 2200m, water reaches critical pressure and can no longer boil. Underwater eruptions account for more than three-quarters of the planet\u2019s total magma output. Bacteria at deep ocean vents thrive on hydrogen sulphide, a highly toxic chemical to most known organisms. Tubeworms are capable of absorbing life-sustaining nutrients directly into their skin.   <\/p>\n<p><strong>HAITI<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Unesco:<\/strong> 1.

Explanada del Panteon, Guanajuato. www.momiasdeguenajuato.<br \/>\nThe mummies at this Guanajuato museum have by no means been treated like kings. The Guanajuato mummies were all evicted from their resting places in the mountains around the town when their families were unable to pay a \u2018grave\u2019 tax. In case the families came into a miraculous windfall and were able to afford reburial, the bodies were kept in an underground crypt. When some were exhumed and found to be well-preserved, the crypt gained notoriety; locals began to pay to view the bodies. For many years bodies were just propped up on the walls but as the collection of bodies grew it was decided to exhibit them behind glass (as you see them today). These mummies have not been wrapped, embalmed or made ready for display like the Egyptian mummies \u2013 they are as they were found. It can be confronting. There are murdered mummies (some with weapons still embedded in the corpses); babies; corpses still fully dressed in their burial outfits\u2026 Generally not one for the kiddies.<br \/>\n2. <strong>National Museum of Anthropology<\/strong>. Cnr Paseo de la Reforma &#038; Calz  Gandhi, Mexico City. www.mna.inah.gob.mc<br \/>\nIf your travel companions are dragging their heels at the prospect of then prepare to play your trump card. This is not another boring anthropology museum, a two-bit, small-scale affair. Expect to be blown away by the world\u2019s largest collection of anthropological artefacts from the Mayan civilisations up to the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. Enter the interior courtyard, where a giant stone edifice has water cascading atmospherically into a central pool, and prepare to step back in time. Twelve rooms encircling the courtyard trace the evolution of the Hispanic civilisations. Magnificent artefacts include the Rock of the Sun \u2013 an ancient crucifixion table from the Mexico-Tenochtitlan period; the 20-tonne giant stone head from the Olmec civilisation of 1200\u2013600 BC; and the resplendent Mayan frescoes from AD 900\u20131250. With each room opening onto atmospheric gardens showcasing statues and temples, seemingly in situ, it\u2019s possible to imagine you\u2019re part of these impressively sophisticated cultures from thousands of years ago.<br \/>\n3. <strong>Soumaya Museum<\/strong>.

Money might not buy you love but it can buy just about everything else. Slim\u2019s collection numbers close to 70,000 pieces, at an estimated worth of more than US$700 million. There are works by famous Modernist and Impressionist masters like Picasso, Dal\u00ed, Renoir and Monet, as well as the world\u2019s largest assortment of sculptures by Rodin, over 380 pieces in fact. While works by the European masters garner a great deal of attention, there\u2019s actually a large selection of Mexican artworks \u2013 everything from musical instruments, furniture, photography, fashion, and decorative and graphic arts.
