The Mallorca Airport near La Palma was unbelievably busy with 75 arriving flights every 3.5 hours and seemed to continue without a break except for a few hours in the middle of the night. Wherever Ryan Air and the other budget airlines fly, there are many tourists.<br \/>\nI arrived at about 6 pm and decided to sleep in the airport on the soft rubber of an indoor playground near the only electrical plug on the entire landside part of the airport. There were 10 others with the same idea.<br \/>\nSpanish airports are notably deficient in the basics like plugs, restaurants and bathrooms on the landside.

I had specifically asked for a phone holder, but the owner had a one-tract mind and was unable to understand. As it turns out, his life involves only driving from his home and shop using the same 1km route. I doubt he could navigate the old city of Palma, even on a scooter. All he says is \u201cDon\u2019t go to the east, see the mountains, follow the signs.\u201d What a joke. I ended up checking Google Maps 5-25 times for each site I wanted to visit and probably drove 150 km lost. The key was to check your route at every roundabout \u2013 or in Palma, at every corner sometimes. Signs were only of value to find towns (unless you wanted to find a hotel, always well-signed). No individual sites had any signs.<br \/>\n<\/em><em>It took me at least 45 minutes to find my way out of Palma having checked Google Maps at least 20 times.

It was built in the 14th century for King\u00a0James II of Majorca and is one of the few circular castles in Europe. First serving as the residence of the\u00a0Kings of Majorca, and afterward long used as a\u00a0military prison\u00a0throughout the 18th to mid-20th century, it is now under civilian control, being one of the main tourist attractions of the island, as well as the seat for the city&#8217;s History Museum.<br \/>\nThe castle&#8217;s plan is a circular floor with round towers attached while the principal one is coupled to the complex by a high bridge over the surrounding moat.<br \/>\nThe castle originally served as a residence for the\u00a0Kings of Mallorca and was subsequently seldom used as a residence.

The Ma-10 highway north of A is one of the most stunning drives in the world. The range is rugged with dramatic mountains.<\/em><br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Cultural Landscape of the Serra de Tramuntana<\/strong> WHS. Located on a sheer-sided mountain range parallel to the north-western coast of the island of Mallorca. Millennia of agriculture in an environment with scarce resources has transformed the terrain into agricultural terraces and inter-connected waterworks \u2013 including watermills \u2013 as well as dry stone constructions and farm terraces for the management of water revolving around farming units of feudal origins. Several villages, churches, sanctuaries, towers, lighthouses and small dry-stone structures contribute to its actual character.<br \/>\nHarvesting and management were introduced by the Christian conquerors, who took over Mallorca in the 13th century AD \u2013 orchards, vegetable gardens and olive groves \u2013 initially organized around small farm holdings, and later in large estates<br \/>\nWaterworks for collecting and storing water featured qanats (underground channels to harvest and transport water), canals, ditches, storage basins, and terraces supported by dry-stone walls with a sophisticated drainage system to avoid soil erosion.<br \/>\nTheir land distribution and use pattern, comprising rocky areas on the tops of mountains, strips of woodland, slopes with terraces, extensive grazing land, fields for reaping, vineyards or fruit crops on flatter land, ensured over time the full exploitation of the existing resources. The Tramuntana pays testimony to the evolution of human settlement in a rugged and steep area of the island.<br \/>\nThis impressive range of mountains covers the west and north sides of the island. They<br \/>\nare rugged and appear to be limestone.<br \/>\nAs you drive around the park, there are ancient, stone-fronted terraces. The best examples are seen around the towns of:<br \/>\n<strong>Estellencia<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Banyalbufar.<\/strong> With the best terraces, most of the frequent cisterns were dry in August.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Valldemossa<\/strong> is a tourist hotspot with narrow lanes lined by stone houses topping out at a square with the George Sand and Frederic Chopin Museum.<br \/>\n<em>Above Vallemossa, the highway climbs to its high point at Clarinet Pass (485m) with distant views of Palma.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>SOLLER*<br \/>\n<\/strong><em>Around Soller were many olive groves with massive trunks.<br \/>\nI had a great Indian meal in Soller. <\/em><strong><br \/>\nSoller tramway line. <\/strong>This old-fashioned tram has two green cars and is a nice ride through the town. 3E<br \/>\n<strong>S\u00f3ller Botanical Garden<\/strong><strong> Fornalutx.<\/strong>\u00a0This small garden has many indigenous plants of most of the Mediterranean islands plus a nice alpine section of Mallorca plants.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nFornalutx.<\/strong>\u00a0Village NE of Soller<br \/>\n<em>After the short drive to Fornalutx, I slept at the lovely mirador above Soller with views down to the Port of Soller at night.\u00a0<\/em><em>Up early, I passed many bicycles, many more than cars.

The Roman conquest of the island began in 123 BC and was the beginning of urban life in Mallorca. The Roman town of Pollentia was built at a strategic location between the Bays of Alcudia and Pollenca. It was the most important city in the Balearics during the Roman period &#8211; between the 1<sup>st<\/sup> century BC and the 3<sup>rd<\/sup> century AD.<br \/>\nthe present site has little interesting to see with a residential area of low walls and a few columns, a small theatre and a forum.<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>S&#8217;Albufera de Mallorca Nature Park.\u00a0<\/strong>Birdwatchers come to this wetland in Mallorca from all over Europe to see rare migrants here like Montagu&#8217;s harriers and Eleanora&#8217;s falcons; species breeding here include stonechats, mustached warblers and the long-eared owl. Ospreys leave their breeding sites on the cliffs to come here to fish; peregrines and hoopoes live here all year round.<br \/>\nThe name derives from the Arabic for &#8216;lagoon&#8217;, but the site has been exploited since Roman times. Pliny writes of night herons, probably from S&#8217;Albufera, being sent to Rome as a gastronomic delicacy. The wetlands were drained for agriculture in the 19th century by a British company that went bankrupt; the network of canals dates from this time.<br \/>\nRice was introduced in the early 20th century, paper was manufactured from the reeds and sedges, and it is only since 1985, following fears that tourist development was damaging the area&#8217;s fragile ecology, that S&#8217;Albufera has been a protected nature reserve.

The majority of the mining sites are coal and iron ore mines, but metals such as copper, silver, lead, gold and mercury were also mined. Among the selected sites are also stone quarries and salt works. In the oldest of these sites, mining activity dates back to the Neolithic period. Quarries excavated stone for use in all types of construction from the earliest settlers in the Talayotic Period to the present.<br \/>\nExtraction is in the form of blocks which are subsequently broken into smaller pieces for different applications in construction. Traditional quarrying was the use of hand tools which left unique marks on the quarry wall.
