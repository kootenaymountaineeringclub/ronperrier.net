Departing at 9:20, we ascended south through timber, passed through a higher block where the road was snowed in, and continued (now on snow) through timber and up a ridge to reach a bump at 013-031. Then we walked southwest on snow over various lumps along a ridge system leading to the base of our objective\u2019s north ridge, which we surmounted without difficulty. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">On top by 1:35, we rested for 20 min. near the prominent green communications cone and tried our best to pick out landmarks in the murky, stormy weather, which eventually overtook us for a bout of light rain. We were treated to fine views of ferries plying Kootenay Lake below us, to indifferent vistas of the Purcells, and to cloud and mist in Kokanee to our west. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Retracing our steps, we reached the truck in 2 hrs. 45 min., making for a 7 hr. 20 min. day. The snow conditions were excellent. Cut blocks to the northeast of the summit in the upper reaches of Leake Creek would give easy access to this fine viewpoint later in the year, but the road to these blocks may be restricted (I don\u2019t think these cut blocks are the ones heli-logged since the terrain doesn\u2019t seem very steep. I\u2019ll leave it to someone else to explore this approach. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\"> Kim Kratky\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>BALFOUR KNOB (2253m\u00a0 7392\u2019) Map Crawford Bay 82F\/10 By Kim Kratky On Sunday, June 1st, Doug Brown, Sandra McGuinness, the dog Kumo, and I climbed this minor peak above Balfour in the Kokanee Group.
