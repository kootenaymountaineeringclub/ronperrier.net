So the idea of a permanent rink, housed inside a high-rise complex to minimize obstruction to pedestrians, would not have been expected to invite controversy. But one important stakeholder strenuously objected: the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, which decreed that\u00a0the new complex would undermine\u00a0central Vienna\u2019s \u201coutstanding universal value. Vienna\u2019s historic city center has been a UNESCO World Heritage site since 2001, one of\u00a0the organization\u2019s 1,154 unique landmarks around the globe deemed worthy of protection. Since announcing its objection to the high-rise rink in 2017, the World Heritage committee has kept Vienna on\u00a0its \u201cin danger\u201d list\u2014joining 50 other embattled sites, from the\u00a0ancient villages of northern Syria\u00a0to\u00a0Everglades National Park\u00a0in\u00a0Florida.

Its track record has been mixed, however, when it comes to preventing the flow of tourists from\u00a0becoming a deluge. For example, the once somnolent village of Hoi An, on\u00a0Vietnam\u2019s central coast, now faces a crush of visitors that its narrow streets cannot accommodate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Some locales have succeeded in managing overtourism on their own, like Dubrovnik,\u00a0Croatia, which, under pressure from UNESCO,\u00a0capped the number of visitors\u00a0in its historic center.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Then there are\u00a0Cambodia\u2019s 12th-century temples at\u00a0Angkor Wat, at one time accessible only to priests.

In\u00a0Laos, for example, the government has proceeded with plans to construct a dam on the Mekong River near the ancient capital of Louangphabang, despite UNESCO\u2019s insistence that a\u00a0heritage impact assessment\u00a0takes place beforehand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Climate Change Threatening World Heritage Sites<br \/>\n<\/strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Of late, UNESCO has had to confront a newer enemy: climate change. In 2007, it published a paper written by scientists who alerted the organization to growing threats in 26 different World Heritage sites. These included glaciers and biodiversity hotspots, but also archaeological landmarks such as the sprawling pre-Hispanic earthen city at Chan Chan,\u00a0Peru, due to intense precipitation brought by\u00a0El Ni\u00f1o.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">On this front as well, the organization has limited tools at its disposal. An example is\u00a0Australia\u2019s legendary\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/education.nationalgeographic.org\/resource\/great-barrier-reef\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Great Barrier Reef<\/a>, a World Heritage site\u00a0since 1981. Last year,\u00a0UNESCO threatened\u00a0to place the vast coral ecosystem on the \u201cin danger\u201d list if the Australian government did not more adequately work to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions\u2014the first time in its history that climate change factored into such a warning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">After intense lobbying from the Australians, the committee\u00a0deferred its decision\u00a0until late 2022. In March, UNESCO dispatched a monitoring team to the reef. Although the Australian government has reportedly pledged roughly $125 million to protect the reef, it remains to be seen whether Australia\u2019s historical aversion to a responsible national climate policy will be reversed.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/0ef4e11f-750d-4ba2-bfa5-294ff9510907\/NationalGeographic_2764874.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=1912\" alt=\"An ecologist prepares a collection net under water for the coming coral spawn at Moore Reef in the Great Barrier Reef\" data-src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/0ef4e11f-750d-4ba2-bfa5-294ff9510907\/NationalGeographic_2764874.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=1912\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\" style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span class=\"RichText\">An ecologist prepares an underwater collection net for the coming coral spawn at Moore Reef in Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef, a UNESCO World Heritage site since 1981.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--below-paragraph InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\" data-bumper-index=\"10\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\"><\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\" data-bumper-index=\"12\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/c6234df8-c38f-4d21-87de-de1d698841a7\/NationalGeographic_2734454.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=1706\" alt=\"An aerial view of the Great Barrier Reef\" data-src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/c6234df8-c38f-4d21-87de-de1d698841a7\/NationalGeographic_2734454.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=1706\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\" style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span class=\"RichText\">This aerial photo shows the size of the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Queensland.

The lagoon city has been simultaneously beset by stupefying overtourism (25 million visitors in 2019) and increasingly severe flooding exacerbated by climate change. Yet UNESCO decided last year\u00a0not to place Venice on its \u201cdanger\u201d list\u2014once again, an apparent victory for government lobbyists and a defeat for environmental groups, who argued that Italy\u2019s new ban on large cruise ships did not go far enough to address the crisis.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Following UNESCO\u2019s act of inaction, Venetian officials took matters into their own hands. Beginning in January, Venice will be the first city in the world to charge an entrance fee, in hopes that this will slow the daily avalanche of visitors. Will it work? If it does, UNESCO will have played a role\u2014indistinct and inconclusive, but still important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Flawed and at times powerless though it may be, the World Heritage program remains relevant, if only because of the principle it espouses.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">That principle is as simple as it is inconvenient: the world\u2019s diverse treasures require protection since they cannot protect themselves. So it matters to say, as UNESCO has, that an ice skating rink endangers Vienna\u2019s historic center. If, at such moments, the World Heritage Committee exists only as a focal point where conscience is summoned, then the next 50 years may find it more important than ever.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<\/article>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Some WHS are difficult to visit.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u2022 <strong>Thimlich Ohinga Archaeological Site WHS.\u00a0<\/strong>Situated 46 km northwest of the town of Migori, in the Lake Victoria region of Kenya, this dry-stone walled settlement was one of the first pastoral communities in the Lake Victoria Basin, which persisted from the 16th to the mid-20th century. <span lang=\"EN-GB\">The main outside wall is an impressive 3.5 m to 4.2 m high, with an average thickness of 1-3 m.<br \/>\nI put my name in the guest book \u2013 there had not been a visitor here since March 8 (ie over 2 months).

I came from the West \u2013 and that was not the way to come. Google Maps gave several options from this direction and I took the longest one approaching from the south. The last 8 km was a disaster of eroded dirt, huge holes, and massive ruts. It required high clearance and AWD.<br \/>\nWhen I left, I took the road to the east. It was 14 km of rough rocky road with only a few washed-out areas, then 14 km on good pavement to the main highway in the town of Uriri This was obviously the only way to come.<br \/>\n<em>About 5 km from Thimlich Ohinga, I got a flat. I could find the jack but not the spanner or key for the bolts. I\u00a0<\/em><\/span><em>was prepared to sleep the night and <\/em><em>called the rental company. It was raining very hard and I was soaked. Various locals came by and one of them was very handy. He searched the side pocket where the jack was and found the spanner and tool pouch with the key (I had felt all over and amazingly missed it all \u2013 I felt like a fool). He sent someone back to the village to get a large crescent wrench to use the jack, changed the tire for me and I gave him 2000KS, a great deal for both of us.
