Then it was necessary to check in online 48 hours before and get to the airport early. Fiji Air doesn&#8217;t issue a boarding pass in NAN for the SUV-FUN leg as it is international and requires a separate check-in. There were no problems on return.<\/p>\n<p><strong> Day 1<\/strong> Thur Oct 24<br \/>\nThe flight arrived at noon, immigration was routine and I walked 5 minutes to Esfam Hotel. There was a fan but AC was necessary for the intense heat and humidity. Sue&#8217;s Kitchen was recommended as the best food by a friend but it closes for dinner and the menu uninspiring. I walked down to the KY store and bought UHT milk (at AUS$2\/litre, some of the cheapest in the world). Also staying at the Esfam was Ned, a young English fellow and we went for dinner at Fast Food, a Chinese restaurant with surprisingly good food at a good price.<br \/>\nNed developed food poisoning from his fish and chips and vomited a few times. He smells fecal smells and rotten food that I don&#8217;t seem to notice. Funafuti is a messy place with few attractive homes or businesses and trash and old appliances in the yards.<br \/>\nNo one walks anywhere and there are many motorcycles.<br \/>\nOther tourists were a group of 8 on a Lupine tour and ex-pats, mostly UN, UNICEF and others.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 2<\/strong> Fri Oct 25<br \/>\nBreakfast was surprisingly good. Ned and I went for a walk. We finally found a good beach on the lagoon south of the &#8220;Government Buildings&#8221; and actually cut through the Prime Minister&#8217;s yard to access the beach. Locals don&#8217;t swim on the ocean side as it is too rough. The water was warm, the beach nice and we had a great swim. There was no one else swimming. We rinsed off in the PM&#8217;s outside shower and got our tops wet to endure the heat and humidity.<br \/>\nWe walked along the runway which has been repaved by Australians and Kiwis. Work was still ongoing between flights. We explored the Filamona (booked out by the paving crews) and it was nothing special.<br \/>\nI finished by doggy bag meal of sweet and sour chicken from the night before.<br \/>\n<strong>Teone Catholic Church.<\/strong> (Christ the King Parish). After dinner, I walked to the church, the only NM site on Funafuti. Google Maps is all wrong. The church is near the wharf on the lagoon side, a small white building with no sign. With good instructions, I missed on my first walk by. Inside is underwhelming with a small square room, three benches against the back wall and some stacked chairs. The Ways of the Cross are simple copies of paintings.

The origins of the people of Tuvalu are addressed in the theories regarding migration into the Pacific that began about three thousand years ago. During pre-European-contact times, Polynesians conducted frequent canoe voyages between the islands as their navigation skills enabled them to make planned journeys via double-hull sailing canoes or outrigger canoes.<br \/>\nScholars believe that the Polynesians spread out from\u00a0Samoa\u00a0and\u00a0Tonga\u00a0into the Tuvaluan atolls, with Tuvalu providing a stepping stone to further migration into the\u00a0Polynesian outliers\u00a0in\u00a0Melanesia\u00a0and\u00a0Micronesia.<br \/>\nIn 1568, Spanish navigator \u00c1lvaro de Menda\u00f1a was the first European to sail through the archipelago, sighting the island of Nui during his expedition in search of Terra Australis. The island of Funafuti was named Ellice&#8217;s Island in 1819; the name Ellice was applied to all of the nine islands after the work of English hydrographer Alexander George Findlay. Great Britain claimed control over the Ellice Islands within their sphere of influence in the late 19th century, as the result of a treaty between Great Britain and Germany relating to the demarcation of the spheres of influence in the Pacific Ocean. Captain Gibson of HMS Curacoa declared each of the Ellice Islands as a British Protectorate in 1892. In 1975, the separate British colonies of Kiribati and Tuvalu were formed and Tuvalu became fully independent as a sovereign state within the Commonwealth in 1978. On 5 September 2000, Tuvalu became the 189th member of the United Nations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DEMOGRAPHICS.<\/strong> Tuvalu consists of six atolls and three reef islands. The smallest, Niulakita, is administered as part of Niutao. Each island has its own high-chief, or ulu-aliki, and several sub-chiefs (alikis). The community council is the Falekaupule (the traditional assembly of elders) or te sina o fenua (literally: &#8220;grey-hairs of the land&#8221;). In the past, another caste, the priests (tofuga), were also among the decision-makers.<br \/>\n<strong>Population<\/strong> in 2020 puts the population at 11,342.\u00a0The population of Tuvalu is primarily of\u00a0Polynesian\u00a0ethnicity, with approximately 5.6% of the population being Micronesians speaking\u00a0Gilbertese, especially on\u00a0Nui.<br \/>\nLife expectancy for\u00a0women in Tuvalu\u00a0is 70.2 years and 65.6 years for men (2018 est.).<br \/>\n<strong>Heritage.<\/strong> The traditional community system still survives to a large extent on Tuvalu. Each family has its own task, or\u00a0salanga, to perform for the community, such as\u00a0fishing,\u00a0house building\u00a0or defence. The skills of a family are passed on from parents to children.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nECONOMY.<\/strong> Public sector workers make up about 65% of those formally employed. Remittances from Tuvaluans living in Australia and New Zealand, and remittances from Tuvaluan sailors employed on overseas ships are important sources of income for Tuvaluans.\u00a0Approximately 15% of adult males work as seamen on foreign-flagged merchant ships.\u00a0Agriculture in Tuvalu\u00a0is focused on\u00a0coconut\u00a0trees and growing\u00a0pulaka\u00a0in large pits of composted soil below the water table. Tuvaluans are otherwise involved in traditional subsistence agriculture and fishing.<br \/>\nDue to the country&#8217;s remoteness, tourism is not significant. Visitors totalled 1,684 in 2010: 65% were on business, development officials or technical consultants, 20% were tourists (360 people), and 11% were expatriates returning to visit family. In 2016, the number of visitors had increased to 2,000.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GET IN<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Visa.<\/strong> Nationals of all Schengen Area states may enter Tuvalu visa-free for a maximum 90 days.

You can sail here from Fiji or Samoa. Islands are very dispersed and travelling to some of them can take quite some time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GET AROUND<br \/>\nBy car.<\/strong> There are limited transport services in Tuvalu. There are about eight kilometres (5 miles) of roads. The streets of Funafuti were paved in mid-2002, but other roads are unpaved.<br \/>\n<strong>By boat.<\/strong> Funafuti is the only port, but there is a deep-water berth in the lagoon at Nukufetau.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GEOGRAPHY<br \/>\n<\/strong>Tuvalu is a volcanic archipelago and consists of three reef islands (Nanumanga, Niutao and Niulakita) and six true atolls (Funafuti, Nanumea, Nui, Nukufetau, Nukulaelae and Vaitupu). Its small, scattered group of low-lying atolls have poor soil and a total land area of only about 26 square kilometres (10 square miles) making it the fourth smallest country in the world. The highest elevation is 4.6 metres (15 ft) above sea level on Niulakita. Over four decades, there had been a net increase in land area of the islets of 73.5\u2009ha (2.9%), although the changes are not uniform, with 74% increasing and 27% decreasing in size. The sea level at the Funafuti tide gauge has risen to 3.9 mm per year, approximately twice the global average. The rising sea levels are identified as creating an increased transfer of wave energy across reef surfaces, which shifts sand, resulting in accretion to island shorelines. The Tuvalu Prime Minister objected to the implication that there were &#8220;alternate&#8221; strategies for Islanders to adapt to rising sea levels and criticized it for neglecting issues such as saltwater intrusion into groundwater tables as a result of sea level rise.<br \/>\nOn the atolls, an annular reef rim surrounds the lagoon with several natural reef channels. Surveys in 2010 of the reef habitats showed 317 fish species including 66 species that had not previously been recorded in Tuvalu, which brings the total number of identified species to 607. Tuvalu&#8217;s exclusive economic zone covers an oceanic area of approximately 900,000 km2.<br \/>\nThe predominant vegetation is the cultivated coconut woodland, which covers 43% of the land, the native broadleaf forest is limited to 4.1%. Tuvalu contains the Western Polynesian tropical moist forests terrestrial ecoregion.<br \/>\n<strong>Environmental pressures.\u00a0<\/strong>The eastern shoreline of Funafuti Lagoon was modified during World War II when the airfield (now Funafuti International Airport) was constructed. The coral base of the atoll was used as fill to create the runway. The resulting borrow pits impacted the fresh-water aquifer. In the low-lying areas of Funafuti, the seawater can be seen bubbling up through the porous coral rock to form pools with each high tide. In 2014, the Tuvalu Borrow Pits Remediation (BPR) project was approved so that 10 borrow pits would be filled with sand from the lagoon, leaving Tafua Pond, which is a natural pond. 365,000 sqm of sand were dredged from the lagoon to fill the holes and improve living conditions on the island. This project increased the usable land space on Fongafale by eight percent.<br \/>\nDuring World War II, several piers were constructed, beach areas were filled and deep-water access channels were excavated. These alterations to the reef and shoreline resulted in changes to wave patterns, with less sand accumulating to form the beaches, and the shoreline is now exposed to wave action.<br \/>\nThe reefs have 80 percent of the coral bleached as a consequence of the increase in ocean temperatures and ocean acidification. The coral bleaching, which includes staghorn corals, is attributed to the increase in water temperature during the El Ni\u00f1os that occurred between 1998 and 2001.<br \/>\nThe rising population has resulted in an increased demand on fish stocks, which are under stress, although the creation of the Funafuti Conservation Area has provided a fishing exclusion area to help sustain the fish population across the Funafuti lagoon. Population pressure on the resources of Funafuti, and inadequate sanitation systems, have resulted in pollution. Organic waste composting in eco-sanitation systems. Plastic waste is a problem in Tuvalu.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nCLIMATE. <\/strong>Two distinct seasons, a wet season from November to April and a dry season from May to October. Westerly gales and heavy rain are the predominant weather conditions from October to March, known as Tau-o-lalo, with tropical temperatures moderated by easterly winds from April to November.<br \/>\nEl Ni\u00f1o effects increase the chances of tropical storms and cyclones, while La Ni\u00f1a effects increase the chances of drought. 200 to 400 mm (8 to 16 in) of rainfall per month.<br \/>\n<strong>Impact of climate change. <\/strong>As low-lying islands lacking a surrounding shallow shelf, Tuvalu is especially susceptible to changes in sea level and undissipated storms. At its highest, Tuvalu is only 4.6 metres (15 ft) above sea level. It is estimated that a sea level rise of 20\u201340 centimetres (8\u201316 inches) in the next 100 years could make Tuvalu uninhabitable. The sea-level rise near Tuvalu measured by satellite altimeters since 1993 is about 5 mm (0.2 in) per year.<br \/>\n<strong>Cyclones.<\/strong> Tuvalu thus has the second-lowest maximum elevation of any country (after the\u00a0Maldives). The highest elevations are typically in narrow storm dunes on the ocean side of the islands which are prone to overtopping in tropical cyclones. The 1972\u00a0Cyclone Bebe submerged\u00a0Funafuti, eliminating 90% of structures on the island. Sources of drinking water were contaminated as a result of the system&#8217;s storm surge and the flooding of the sources of fresh water.<br \/>\nTuvalu experienced an average of three cyclones per decade between the 1940s and 1970s; however, eight occurred in the 1980s. The impact of individual cyclones is subject to variables including the force of the winds and whether a cyclone coincides with high tides.<br \/>\nIn March 2015, wind and storm surges created by Cyclone Pam resulted in waves of 3 metres (9.8 ft) to 5 metres (16 ft) breaking over the reef of the outer islands, causing damage to houses, crops and infrastructure.<br \/>\n<strong>King tides.<\/strong> The highest peak tide is 3.4 metres (11 ft), which leads to flooding of low-lying areas, which is compounded when sea levels are further raised by La Ni\u00f1a effects or local storms and waves.<br \/>\n<strong>Water and sanitation. <\/strong>Rainwater harvesting is the principal source of fresh water in Tuvalu. Nukufetau, Vaitupu and Nanumea are the only islands with sustainable groundwater supplies. The effectiveness of rainwater harvesting is diminished because of poor maintenance of roofs, gutters and pipes.<br \/>\nReverse osmosis (R\/O) desalination units supplement rainwater harvesting in Funafuti. The 65 m3 desalination plant operates at a real production level of around 40 m3 per day. R\/O water is only intended to be produced when storage falls below 30%, however, demand to replenish household storage supplies with tanker-delivered water means that the R\/O desalination units are continually operating.
