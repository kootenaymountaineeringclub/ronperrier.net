David Jones and I climbed it on Sat., May 24th. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">For very good access, drive about 2.4 km. west of town on Hwy. 31 and turn right or north where a sign says \u201cGarbage Dump.\u201d You will need a 4WD, high clearance vehicle with low range. Turn right immediately after entering the road. Take the next left (right is gated and signed) and prepare for serious water bars. At km. 5.1, go left. We were able to drive to km. 6.6 (about 4500\u2019) before being stopped by snow. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Leaving at 9:25 and carrying snowshoes, we hiked up the road, cutting off some switchbacks by travelling through a burn. We meandered along the broad SW ridge of our peak, re-joining the road and following it to the end at about 2150 m. (7100\u2019) where the SW ridge steepens (about 617-160). By 12:50, we were on the broad, level, cairned summit to enjoy spectacular views of Trout Lake, the Badshots, and the Lardeau Range on this warm, sunny day. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">After a 50 min. rest, we followed our ascent route back to the truck in 90 min. Almost all travel was on snow, and conditions were surprisingly good as we never used the snowshoes. This peak could make an easy summer or fall outing, especially if your vehicle is up to this challenging road used by Great Northern Cat Ski. Driving times from Nelson: 2 hr. 30 min. via Nakusp (but that was leaving at 4:30 am); 2 hr. 45 min. return via Gerard and Kaslo. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Kim Kratky\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Great Northern Mountain lies directly north of the Trout Lake City townsite.
