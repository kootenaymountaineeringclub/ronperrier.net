This is the most \u201cEuropeanized\u201d country in the Balkans (similar to Slovenia). It has a completely different look and feel from N Macedonia, Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina.<br \/>\nThere are large tolled expressways, Lidl grocery stores and McDonalds. Everything looks more prosperous. Zagreb has many old buildings and wonderful architecture. It looks like it never had any war damage unlike everywhere else that took a beating in both World Wars and the Balkan wars of 1992-1999.<br \/>\n2. It is almost all Roman Catholic with a small Muslim population. The alphabet is Latin. I can\u2019t help but believe having a Cyrillic alphabet is an economic and educational detriment. Most people speak good English. All these promote a better economy.<br \/>\n3. Prices are also higher. I didn\u2019t fill up with gas, but diesel is about \u20ac1.27\/litre.<br \/>\n3. It appears that Google is blocked in Croatia \u2013 at least I couldn\u2019t access it unless I used my VPN. I\u2019m not sure what else may be blocked.<br \/>\n4.<strong> Currency:<\/strong> Croatian Kuna &#8211; HRK (usually shortened to KN). In May 2019, 1 \u20ac = 7.43 KN.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rastoke.<\/strong> In the NM \u201cSmall Towns\u201d series, this one actually had something worthwhile seeing. The Jesenica River originating in the Mala Kapela Mountains flows for 6 km and then disappears continuing as a subterranean track for about 20 km to reemerge as the Slunj\u0107ica River south of Slunj. The Slurj\u010dica River flows into the Korana River at Rastoke where there is a natural travertine barrier with the lower part of Rastoke having 23 waterfalls about 10-29m high falling into the Korana. The most famous are the English and English Fairy hair waterfalls.<br \/>\nRastoke is known for its water-powered mechanical mills. The bottom of the houses are travertine rock and the upper parts are wood with shingle or tile roofs. Calcium sediment has sealed the openings of the cellar stones covering them with sinter so that water cannot run into the houses even at high water levels.<br \/>\nAt its peak, Rastoke had 22 mills dating back to the 17<sup>th<\/sup> century. The mills were driven by horizontally aligned paddle wheels and water could be diverted whenever necessary to turn millstones. Every house had 2 or 3 millstones to grind \u201cblack corn\u201d (maize, rye, barley, millet and oats) and \u201cwhite corn (wheat). Waterpower was also used to pound or finalize woollen cloth and washing machines using water-driven wood barrels.<br \/>\nThe best way to appreciate the town is from the road across the Korana River. Storyboards discuss the formation of tufa by the heavily mineralized water.<br \/>\nIn the 1991-95 War in Croatia, Serb bombs damaged many of the roofs of the traditional houses and some of the waterfalls by throwing explosives into them. The attempts to destroy the giant road bridge across the Korana were unsuccessful.<\/p>\n<p><strong>KARLOVAC. <\/strong>A NM \u201cEuropean City\u201d, this town has little that stands out, other than the fact it was flooding.<br \/>\n<strong>Karlovac Museum.<\/strong> Like all city museums, it has archaeology from the Stone Age, rocks, some natural history and many documents of the city and area.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ozalj Castle<\/strong> (Castle Turk), Ozalj. About 9kms north of Karlovac, this is small rectangular \u201ccastle\u201d is a complete ruin with about half of the one-story wall remaining and completely overgrown by trees. There was a large abandoned manor house next to it. All were signed \u201cPrivate\u201d. Free<\/p>\n<p><em>Zagreb was a 45km drive on the first big expressway I had driven on for a month. With a speed limit of 130km\/hr, some drivers were going at autobahn speeds. The toll was <\/em><em>\u20ac4.60, about the same <\/em><em>\u20ac1\/10kms that you pay everywhere.<br \/>\n<\/em><em>I went to a VW dealer to try to arrange an oil change but they were booked up for a week and referred me to a nearby Skoda dealer who made an appointment for 1 pm the next day. VW recommends an oil change at an unbelievable 40,000km and my odometer was at about 31,000km (I change the oil in my Chev diesel at home every 6,000 km). <\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>ZAGREB\/VELIKA GORICA<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>TIPS for ZAGREB<br \/>\n1. Zagreb Card. <\/strong>Good at only 5 museums (and a discount at others \u2013 see page 16 in the guide), all public transport (but downtown Zagreb is easy walking, but does count for the funicular), and about 45 other attractions. 98 for 24 hours, 130 for 72 hours). Includes Zagreb 360\u00b0 observation deck (worth 60M and was not on the NM list, but I went up).<br \/>\n<strong>2. Parking<\/strong> is impossible anywhere close to downtown. The parking meters use an SMS code method of payment that I had not been able to figure out before, so I parked in an underground parkade in the middle of central Zagreb. The cost for 8 hours was a whopping 126 HRK.<br \/>\n3. Some things not done in North America are legal here: talking and texting on phones when driving and smoking in restaurants and coffee shops.<\/p>\n<p><em>This was a big walkabout day. I saw 23 Nomad Mania sights, a possible record (Zagreb is an NM World City, World Capital and European city). I see museums (especially art galleries) very quickly. I have seen most things before and speed-read the labels and storyboards that interest me. The best museums have terse labels. Churches and markets (I rarely buy anything) are fast.<br \/>\n<\/em><strong>Zagreb Trams.<\/strong> Zagreb\u2019s public transportation system uses trams. Painted blue, there are some old and mostly new trams in the system. Free with the Zagreb Card.<br \/>\n<strong>Zagreb Funicular.<\/strong> The old part of Zagreb (Velika Gorica) sits on a low flat hill. I took it up and down. 5 KN (free with Zagreb Card)<br \/>\n<strong>St. Catherine of Alexandria.<\/strong> With a plain white fa\u00e7ade and 5 sculptures in niches, the interior of this Roman Catholic church is nice with no aisles, rib vaulted ceiling and pink with white stucco vines everywhere inside. There are several nice marble altars and paintings in the ceiling.<br \/>\n<strong>Museum of Broken Relationships.<\/strong> People from all over the world have contributed personal mementos of failed relationships reproduced in eclectic and often hilarious vignettes: a scab from a bicycle accident, herpes cream, a tree branch from a tree planter in the Kootenays (where I lived for 30 years), ashes from a dead father, a toaster, dildo. All quite enjoyable, but there is a lot of reading. 40 KN (reduction with Zagreb card)<br \/>\n<strong>Croatian Museum of Na\u00efve Art.<\/strong> The Na\u00efve period of art was from roughly the 1930\u2019s to 1980 focusing on the Hlebine School. This is a lovely museum with paintings mostly of a cartoonish style, bright colours, simple themes and a whimsical touch. There are also wood carvings, pen and ink drawings and paper mache. The best artist was Ivan Generali\u0107 (1914-92). 25 KN<br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"http:\/\/thearthistoryjournal.blogspot.com\/2011\/04\/ivan-generalic.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ctbtn=\"0\" data-cthref=\"\/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjM6qLX-KXiAhXPZFAKHUb1Au0QjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.ie%2FLocationPhotoDirectLink-g294454-d2236328-i330006512-Croatian_Museum_of_Naive_Art-Zagreb_Central_Croatia.html&amp;psig=AOvVaw1q_cAgdUuUL_WhwfuWIie1&amp;ust=1558298546021295\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwiqqovo-KXiAhWQKVAKHSEWAO0QjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-zfans9s_bSg\/TZxJyK9EtCI\/AAAAAAAAAkU\/ztrEK_RDnUE\/s1600\/%25D0%25A6%25D1%258B%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA.jpg\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"297\" height=\"398\" data-iml=\"1558212209501\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Croatian History Museum.<\/strong> This museum chronicles events around the year 1918 \u2013 WW I, the end of Austro-Hungarian rule and start of the Yugoslavia (Republic of Slovenes, Croats and Serbia) and the Spanish flu epidemic. There were a lot of documents and newspaper clippings all in Croat. Under the secret Treaty of London (Italy, GB, France, Russia), a lot of western Croatia was given to Italy for it not joining the Germans and Austro-Hungarians in WW I. 15 KN<br \/>\n<strong>St. Mark&#8217;s Church.<\/strong> A World Heritage Site, this parish church is the symbol of Zagreb with its multicoloured tile roof composed of the coats of arms of the City of Zagreb and the Tripartite Kingdom of Croatia and its huge clock tower with a copper \u201conion style\u201d dome and the date 1841 when it was added to the church.<br \/>\nOriginally dating from the 13<sup>th<\/sup> century, the church was brick with frescoes on its columns and walls. In the 17<sup>th<\/sup> century, it had 11 altars but they were all removed in the restoration of 1922-37. The polychromes from the altars are in the City Museum of Zagreb.<br \/>\nThis church is oddly closed to tourists as the priest does not like them visiting. I returned at the 6 pm service and had a look (the open door is the smaller west one). There were 11 in the congregation including 2 nuns. It has plain grey walls with 3 huge murals on each of the sidewalls, equal-height aisles and nave and rib vaulted ceilings painted in gold leaf. Free<br \/>\n<strong>Zagreb City Museum.<\/strong> I spent a long time here, not because it is good but because it is so large taking up 3 floors. Each room has a storyboard in English but all the labels of each artifact are in Croat. There are bits of poor archaeology from the 9<sup>th<\/sup> and 7<sup>th<\/sup> BC, 1<sup>st<\/sup>, 7<sup>th<\/sup> and 12<sup>th<\/sup> centuries. 1094 was the first time the name Zagreb appeared in records. A royal fort was built in the middle ages and 130 witches were burned at the stake until 1756 when that was outlawed. The Ottomans attacked requiring reinforcement of all the walls in 1476-78 and 1512 (they were unsuccessful for once). Some of the more interesting exhibits were on guilds, the Order of the Poor Clares (nuns who started the first school), the start of the Croat national revival in the 1840s and promotion of the Croat language from 1860, abolishment of the feudal system in 1848, WW I, WW II and the start of the communist state. 40 KN<br \/>\n<strong>Tortureum.<\/strong> This uses a tablet to give gruesome accounts of about 30 objects used in torture, most truly horrific. Many of the objects are recreated. I am not sure if this is worth the admission cost. A mood is created with low lighting and black walls and curtains. 40 KN, 30 reduced.<br \/>\n<strong>Mushroom Museum.<\/strong> In the NM \u201cBizzarium\u201d series, there are at least 1600 specimens mounted on small disks of tree trunk, all collected by a now elderly professor and his friends.

The first written reference to Vara\u017edin, whose historical name is Garestin, was on 20 August 1181, when King B\u00e9la III mentioned the nearby thermal springs (Vara\u017edinske Toplice) in a legal document. <sup id=\"cite_ref-var-hist1_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>Vara\u017edin was declared a free royal borough in 1209 by the Hungarian King Andrew II. The town became the economic and military centre of northern Croatia. Due to Ottoman raids, the town was structured defensively around the old fortress and acquired the shape of a typical medieval Wasserburg. In the early 13th century, the Knights Hospitaller came to Vara\u017edin, where they built a church and a monastery.<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-var-hist1_5-1\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>At the end of the 14th century, Vara\u017edin fortress passed to the hands of the Counts of Celje. Over the following centuries, Vara\u017edin had several owners, In 1756, the Ban Ferenc N\u00e1dasdy chose Vara\u017edin as his official residence, and Vara\u017edin became the capital of all of Croatia. With the arrival of the Jesuits, the school and the Jesuit house were founded, and churches and other buildings were built in the Baroque style. In the 18th century, Vara\u017edin was the seat of many Croatian noblemen, and in 1756 it became the Croatian administrative centre. The fire of 1776 destroyed most of the town, resulting in the administrative institutions moving back to Zagreb.<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-var-hist1_5-2\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>Vara\u017edin was the seat of the Vara\u017edin County of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia within the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, ruled by the Kingdom of Hungary after the compromise of 1867. The Hungarian stamp, issued in 1881 shows both names. By the 19th century, Vara\u017edin had been completely rebuilt and expanded, with flourishing crafts and trade, and later the manufacture of silk and bricks. The theatre, music school, and fire department were founded.<br \/>\nIn the 20th century, Vara\u017edin developed into the industrial centre of Northwestern Croatia. The textile manufacturer <i>Tivar<\/i> was founded in 1918. In the Croatian War of Independence, 1991, Vara\u017edin suffered directly for only for a few days, because the huge Yugoslav People&#8217;s Army base quickly surrendered, resulting in a minimal number of casualties, and providing weapons (worth $600m) for the Croatian army.<br \/>\nThere are many baroque and rococo palaces and houses in the town. Worth particular mention is Vara\u017edin&#8217;s Croatian National Theatre, built in 1873. A baroque music festival has been held annually in Vara\u017edin since 1971 and attracts some of the finest musicians and their fans from Croatia and the world.
