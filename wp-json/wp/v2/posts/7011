We were headed for a couple of nights in Mulvey Basin with our sights on Gladsheim (my last Mulvey peak) and Asgard (which, assuming success on Gladsheim, would be Sandy&#8217;s last Mulvey peak).<\/span><\/h6>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The big pack combined with high humidity and a beating sun soon had me feeling like I&#8217;d wet myself, but I more or less kept my whining to myself and soldiered on. As we neared treeline, we began to hear some very unwelcome rumbling coming from &#8230; you guessed it, Mulvey Basin. As the storm over the basin intensified, we slowly made our way around Gimli waiting for the storm to move off. But on this day, Thor was not to be so accommodating. By the time we rounded the south ridge of Gimli, the storm was really getting cranked up, and had been stationary for two hours! To add insult to injury, we could see that the only cloud in the whole region was the big, black, and flashing one that was pummeling Gladsheim. Fast moving cloud streamers revealed that the storm sucking energy and moisture from adjacent valleys. About the time we started across the talus field approach to the Gimli-Niselheim col, Thor noticed our intrusion and decided it would be fun to pummel us with snow, hail, and rain. I was starting to feel like the character in the Dirk Gently novels who has a rain cloud follow him around. If I&#8217;d had a sat phone, I would have pushed that Environment Canada speed dial button to let them know what I thought of their forecast.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Once we reached the col, the lashing of hail was reaching a crescendo, so the three of us took shelter, meagre as it was, in a wee alcove about big enough for my dog. Luckily my partners couldn&#8217;t hear my whining over the roar of the raging storm.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">After about 20 minutes, Thor decided to go for pizza, and the storm finally moved off after about three hours stationary over Mulvey Basin. Ren\u00e9 was first back up to the col, and he promptly exclaimed \u201cWow, a winter wonderland!\u201d \u201cOh good\u201d, I thought. He was right though, as Gladsheim was sporting a serious coat of fresh hail. Again I wished for the hotline to Environment Canada. Not to be deterred, we descended the very handy ledge to the snow of Mulvey Basin, wondering if our climb of Gladsheim the following day would rate M4 instead of the 5.0 we were expecting.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The snow in the basin was in very good shape, so we made good time down to camp north of the big Mulvey Lake at around 7000&#8242;. While most of the basin was snow-covered, we were lucky enough to find a large dry area to camp on with easy access to water. While the sun was out, the air was cool and a steady katabatic wind was blowing, as it would constantly for the next two days. As the temperature plummeted that evening, Sandy and I teased Ren\u00e9 mercilessly as he had opted to leave his crampons at home.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">I convinced the others that a 6:00 wakeup was plenty early enough \u2013 how long could it take? \u2013 so we didn&#8217;t head off until 7:00 the next morning under sunny skies and warm temperatures. We quickly made our way down to the next lake, and then back up the meadow to the \u201cWest Ridge Gully\u201d, a very handy ramp that takes a very direct path for 1500 vertical feet to a point high on the west ridge of Gladsheim. Sandy kicked steps for the first section and then it was my turn. Ren\u00e9 used the \u201cOh I&#8217;d kick steps if only I had brought my crampons\u201d excuse &#8230; the gully seemed to go on endlessly in variable snow conditions and hail up to 20-30 cm deep. I thought I must be hallucinating as the ridgeline looked about 30 m away for the last half hour, but finally, we did top out on the west ridge about 1:45 after we left camp.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The next section was pleasant class 3 and 4 scrambling along the undulating west ridge, although we had to watch for slimy lichen near the piles of hail that were melting in the sun. After maybe a half hour of scrambling it came time to don the rock shoes and pull out the rope. I got the first pitch that started from a large ledge on the south side a little down from the ridgeline. I started up a steep vertical crack that was too wide for a fist jam, but just right for a forearm &#8230; hmmm seemed like a \u201cKootenay 5.0\u201d as general consensus was that a modern 5.5 was appropriate. After the first tricky bit, I quickly ran out 35 m over fourth-class terrain and set up a belay station right on the ridge crest.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">I handed Ren\u00e9 the sharp end, and he immediately realized my genius \u2013 his pitch looked much harder than mine. He wound his way up steep bulges on the ridge crest until even he thought it looked too hard to continue that way. Following the directions in the Black Book, he made a descending and very airy, although not technically difficult, traverse on the south side. Eventually, he made a short climb back up to the base of the steep wall. Again, it seemed about a modern 5.5. By now, our sunny skies were much less sunny, and in fact it was looking like another electrical storm was only a question of \u201cwhen\u201d not \u201cif\u201d. With the deteriorating weather in mind, I chose to leave a chock placed at the belay as it was apparently going to take some fussing to get it out; we hoped to pick it up on the way back if it wasn&#8217;t buzzing.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Whilst Sandy and Ren\u00e9 sorted the rack and rope at the top of pitch 2, I scrambled off in search of the mythical \u201ctunnel\u201d. After some easy scrambling up a chimney\/cave\/tunnel, I found myself on a large ledge on the ridgecrest. A friend who had descended the route last summer had sent me a picture of a climber exiting the very deep tunnel\/chimney, so feeling quite ridiculous, I stood around at 9000 feet on the west ridge of Gladsheim holding this photo in my outstretched arm trying to match the picture to the various cracks in the wall in front of me. And presto there it was! It didn&#8217;t look particularly promising but was a perfect match to the photo. I carried only the rope while Ren\u00e9 and Sandy had packs, so I tried not to laugh as they thrutched and grunted their way up the chimney come tunnel \u2013 which was actually quite interesting and fun for those without packs.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The tunnel popped out on the north side of the ridge, and as I&#8217;d been getting off so easy, it was unanimously agreed that it must be my lead again. After exiting the tunnel I headed straight up ledges to the ridgecrest again on easy ledges. Some third-class terrain followed and then a tricky big step up (slimy) and Bob&#8217;s Your Uncle, we were on the ridge top above all the fifth-class climbing. When dry, the big step would probably be about 5.5, but harder for short folk; the rest of the pitch was low fifth at most.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">We have heard many reports that significant rockfall has changed the west ridge of Gladsheim so that it is much harder than the rated 5.0. We saw no evidence of recent significant rockfall, so I don&#8217;t think the rumours are true. I would say however, that by modern standards, the 5.0 rating is about 5 grades too low, and if you don&#8217;t find your way to the tunnel, it would be much harder still.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The remainder of the distance to the top probably accounted for nearly half the length of the ridge, but we didn&#8217;t need the rope, and so after 40 minutes of extremely pleasant class 3 and 4 scrambling (sometimes exposed) we were on the summit. We took a break for nourishment and fluids, rubbernecking all the while, but the building storms to the west encouraged us not to linger too long.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">We quickly scrambled back to above the last tricky step-up of pitch 3 and did our first of four rappels. Rap 2 put us into the tunnel which we all down-climbed. After exiting the tunnel, it became clear that Thor wasn&#8217;t done with us \u2013 the distant thunder wasn&#8217;t sounding so distant anymore. When I threw the rope for our next rap, it crackled in a most unsettling manner and my hair, or what remains of it, started standing on end. Suffice it to say, we made haste and donated the stuck chock to the mountain gods. After Ren\u00e9 and I had finished rap 3 (which ended a maddeningly short distance away from our mountain boots and scrambling terrain), Sandy gave us what would become a familiar status report: \u201cMy ice axe is buzzing again!\u201d I encouraged her to refrain from hurling the frightening thing off the mountain and continue down to us. After our fourth and final rap, we put away the rope and scurried off, taking care of the wet lichen, as it was raining and hailing.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The section of the ridge back to the top of the snow gully seemed much longer and more exposed than it did in the morning, but the static electricity kept us moving as fast as we could &#8211; whenever I lost sight of Ren\u00e9 I only had to listen for the arcing of the rock pro hanging on his harness to find him. We did, however, make it to the top of the gully with all body parts intact \u2013 in fact, we arrived at the gully just as the storm passed off. What was a nasty grunt in the morning was a perfect ski slope in the afternoon, and we very quickly descended down to the meadow, and thence back to camp, arriving 10 hours after we&#8217;d left. Our timing was excellent, as shortly after arriving back at the tent, an impressive storm arrived and pounded the tent for 20 minutes. As the rain beat against the tent wall, I considered, with very mixed emotions, the fact that I had now climbed all the Mulvey Peaks.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The next morning we broke camp and grunted up to around the 8000&#8242; foot level on the south side of Asgard. We dumped our packs and nipped up the east side of Asgard. The views were splendid and the summit register was full of entries from famous people. After we&#8217;d had our fill of the view, we returned to our packs and made our way back to the truck by the way we&#8217;d come in \u2013 this time Thor left us alone, although the skies were looking very threatening as we descended into the valley.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\"><strong>Summary of the roped pitches:<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">P1: Up short vertical crack to ridge, then 4th class, 35 m, 5.5.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">P2: Up a steep section of ridge, then airy descending traverse on the south side, then a short climb up to the base of a smooth wall. 40 m, 5.5.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Scramble up easy ground to the ridgeline, then scramble up 3rd class chimney-come-tunnel exiting on the north side.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">P3: Exit the tunnel, climb ledges on the north side to the ridgeline, and follow the ridgeline with one small step to belay, 5.5, 30 m.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Four raps on the descent.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Doug Brown<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\"><strong>RETURNING HOME: ALL FEMALE FIRST ASCENT OF GLADSHEIM PEAK\u00a0<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">by Isobel Phoebus<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">This all-female team made the first ascent of a new route on the highest peak in the Valhalla\u2019s: Gladshiem Peak.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Participants: Sara Lilley, Sasha Yasinski and Isobel Phoebus<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">At the gateway between Gimli (2806 m), the Valhalla Range\u2019s iconic peak, and Nisleheim (2639 m), I peered over the northern edge of the col\u2019s drop-o\ufb00 into the alpine basin below, where I would spend the next two weeks working towards a new traditional multi-pitch route on Gladsheim Peak (2830 m) with an all-female team.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">This marked my third trip in the area during recent years, after a long hiatus since the early childhood exploration of my backyard between Robertson Creek and Mulvey Creek.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">On a memorable project as an adult, I teamed up with a kindergarten friend, Douglas Noblet (Wildair Photography), a highlining adventure seeker, Mia Noblet (professional slackliner), a talented documenter Peter Benton, and a future partner for big alpine adventures, Kirk Mauthner (Basecamp Innovations; Mount Logan 2021) on a four-day, multi-sport mission to highline between Mount Dag (2745 m) and Little Dag (2020). Although conditions weren\u2019t favorable for our original objective, a lasting memory of climbing to the col between the two peaks remained strong\u2013the opposing faces made their mark and the Valhallas kept calling me back.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">We returned a week later with a short weather window and adjusted our objectives to rig a line between the Wolf\u2019s Ears, in a single day. The weather held and I walked one of my most memorable lines &#8211; the extended e\ufb00ort, the close to home connections, the combination of ski touring, rock climbing and highlining, the natural anchors and the expansive beauty of the surrounding peaks.<br \/>\nValhalla Alpine Highline Team 2020: Kirk Mauthner, Douglas Noblet, Isobel Phoebus and Mia Noblet<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">I came back in 2022 with a new focus of big-wall climbing and hopes of climbing the north face of Mount Dag. Sara Lilley (Calgary, AB), Valerie Dupont (Belgium) and I spent two weeks getting acquainted with the rock, training big-wall strategies, and completing a second ascent of a 950+ m ridgeline, Complete North Ridge of Little Dag (TD+ 5.9+). We climbed with overnight packs on our backs and spent two nights on the wall. With a committng approach and descent, it took us four days to complete the full circuit into Mulvey Basin, up Little Dag, around Wolf\u2019s Ears and back to Gimli camp. It was a great introduction, exposing us to the basin peaks and all their potential.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">In the summer of 2023, I returned once again with Sara and a new partner, Sasha Yasinski (Canmore, AB). Sara is a hydrogeologist, recently specializing in groundwater flow of alpine cave systems. She also has experience as an ACMG Climbing Instructor and cave guide. Sasha is a seasoned wild-land firefighter, an ACMG Apprentice Rock Guide and co-founder of the DirtBabe Collective, which hosts holistic mountain programs combining technical skill development with therapeutically framed experiences and support. My professional background is in wildlife biology, also holding roles of Vice-President and science instructor with Girls on Ice Canada, which runs programs that interweave science, art and adventure to inspire curiosity and confidence in the next generation of leaders. Our team gathered in the Mulvey Basin to learn together as we stepped into the unknown. This ascent would be for each of us, our first time creating a new route, and it would mark the first all-female first ascent in the Valhallas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\"><strong>Mulvey Basin Overview and Crystal Pocket Route 2023<\/strong>.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">With no backcountry facilities and a technically challenging approach, the Mulvey Basin is more remote than the popular Gimli backcountry campsite. Accessed by first hiking the Gimli Ridge trail, travelling past the col into the basin requires an exposed traverse and technical equipment (i.e. ice axes and crampons), depending on conditions (total distance 6 km, elevation gain 900 m and loss 400 m). As visitors to the basin, we followed leave-no-trace principles, bear-proofed our food and minimized our impact. Found within Valhalla Provincial Park, an extensive wilderness area, the land is Ged to Indigenous Peoples of the Ktunaxa, the Okanagan, the Shuswap and the Sinixt NaGons.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The challenging access delayed activity in the basin, and it was one of the last areas in the Selkirks to be explored. At times, Mulvey Basin was bustling with climbers from near and far, including Kootenay Mountaineering Club members to international enthusiasts. In the early 1960s, access was significantly more demanding as it required bushwhacking up Mulvey Creek (over 8 km). Flying in by helicopter was more reasonable at the time. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">In 1963, the first ascent of Gladsheim was completed by the west ridge at an original rating of 5.0. Climbers enjoyed the luxuries of a cabin in the Mulvey Meadows, built in 1969, but no longer standing. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The 1970s brought a boost in climbing camps and first ascents, including accomplishments by well-known adventurers like Fred Beckey. However, despite their incredible nature, today most of the rock faces in the Valhallas are rarely climbed, with the excepGon of Gimli Peak.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Norse mythology depicts Valhalla as a majesGc hall situated in the divine realm of Asgard. Several mountain ranges and peaks in Southern Kootenay have been named aBer figures from Scandinavian mythology. One of the twelve halls of Asgard, &#8220;Gladsheim,&#8221; is the Great Hall of the Gods. Our goal was to atempt a first ascent on the southwest face of Gladsheim, located on the north side of the Mulvey Basin. Rarely climbed, it had been 15 years since a new line was documented on the walls of this hall.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The Valhallas host variable rock features, including flakes, corner systems, cracks, and technical faces. A large rock rack including pins and emergency gear is key. Guidance for this trip was acquired over time from local experts including David Lussier, Stephen Senecal, Jasmin Caton and Cam Shute. In recognition of local community ethics, we climbed from the ground up, using removable protection. No bolts were placed, although we carried the means if needed for safety in otherwise unprotectable terrain. We honor the <\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">tradition of preserving the sense of adventure that makes climbing in the Valhallas so special. Warming up to the rock and our team dynamics, we ventured on classics of the area, including the Integral and Full West Ridge (AD+, 5.7, 410 m), the South Dihedral (D, 5.10a, 300 m), and \u00c9toile Filante (D, 5.11c, 250 m).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Our new line stood out to us after days of deliberaGon. Central to the southwest face of Gladsheim, a continuous crack led to a prominent roof feature that was calling us.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Establishing the route over two days, without fixed gear or ropes, we were surprised by the route. The main crux transitioned from a wide crack through steep roofs, narrowing to a thin crack and unknown darkness.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">From below, we were uncertain if the route would go at 5.8, 5.12, require aid or a few bolts. With boosted power from a giant crystal pocket, our clean and free team onsight went through a crux of hand jams, finger locks and wild stemming\u2013a striking pitch with high exposure over the basin. After the seventh roped pitch of crack climbing, we scrambled to the top of the West Ridge, which led to the proper Gladsheim summit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">This marks the first female first ascent in the Valhallas. We hope that Kootenay Mountaineering Club members and the broader climbing community get out to enjoy the route and all the basin has to o\ufb00er. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Our team comes from di\ufb00erent geographic communities, but we all share the value of expanding opportunities in the mountains.
