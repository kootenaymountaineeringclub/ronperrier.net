Guided trip with Ecosummer Adventures 1992. Stayed at a B&amp;B in Sandspit and then took a Beaver south to Rose Harbour in Stuart Huston Channel separating Moresby and Islands.

Guided trip with Scott Aitken of Cetacean Adventures, a jobber for Sea to Sky. Participants were Scott and his girlfriend from Winnipeg and Jan Micklethwaite. Launch 30km south of Loreto at Ligui. Crossed south of Danzante Island and camped on Punta Baja on the west end of Carmen Island and hiked up the hill east of camp. Kayaked to Arroyo Blanco, a nice beach at the foot of a spectacular white canyon which we hiked up to the viewpoint to see the ocean on the other side the island, a long way to scour for firewood. Camped next on the beach on the south side of Salinas, the town built for the salt works. Town abandoned in the 1970s, except for a \u201ccaretaker\u201d wearing gold shoes who told us we were not allowed to camp close to the town. Explored the town and camped at Punta Perico, east of town. Early next AM, started early to try to beat the usual NW wind with a goal of circumnavigating the rest of Carmen. Jan and I were such poor paddlers that the attempt had to be abandoned and we basically returned the way we had come.<br \/>\nOn the beach on the mainland we met a German tourist who told us about Sierra de San Francisco, near San Ignatio, the entry point to a spectacular canyon with 5,000 year old cave paintings. In town we met with the headman who organized a guide, Angel Arci, who with 2 burros and 2 mules took us down a spectacular steep trail down into the verdant canyon with flowing water. The best was Pintura, a 100m long overhang with confluent paintings of animals and anthromorphic figures.<br \/>\nBaja Mexico.
