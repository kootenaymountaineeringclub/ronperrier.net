A National Historic Site dedicated to telling the story of over 22,000 Japanese Canadians who were forcibly relocated in 1942 during World War II. 75% were Canadian citizens, were stripped of their rights, labelled enemy aliens, and forcibly removed from their coastal BC homes to interior BC relocation camps or sugar beet farms in Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario. Besides paying tribute to those relocated, the center pays tribute to the rich legacy of the <em>issei<\/em> (first generation) pioneers who first arrived in Canada in 1877.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The victims of racist legislation and dispersal policies resulted in some Nikkei returning after the war to Japan and areas east of the Rocky Mountains. That fractured community of 60,000 is still rebuilding today. The Kyowakai (working together peacefully\u201d) Society created this project. <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Approximately 300 wood shacks were built in a flat area called the Orchards and three surrounding leased ranch acreages by the internees. 1505 Japanese Canadians were assigned to this area.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">One of the benefits of the evacuation was that a tuberculosis sanitarium, called the \u201cSan\u201d was constructed in March 1943 at New Denver in an ideal setting. Due to its setting and treatment later with miracle drugs, most patients made remarkable recoveries which may not have been possible before the war. This was to be the main hospital to serve the dental and medical needs of all internees in BC\u2019s interior. <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The evacuees cultivated their own gardens as the climate and soil were highly conducive to growing.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Located on the site of \u201cThe Orchard\u201d internment camp, the NIMC contains original buildings, period artifacts and interpretive displays as well as the <strong>Heiwa Teien Peace Garden<\/strong>, designed by the renowned Japanese Canadian gardener, Tomomichi (Roy) Sumi. $9.00\/adult, $7.00\/student or senior, $20\/family<br \/>\n<\/span><strong style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Marina. <\/strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Walk along the creek or village streets to the main road, cross Carpenter Creek and turn left down Bellevue Avenue.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Mori Trail<\/strong> follows the shoreline from Carpenter Creek northwards to Bigelow Bay.

Bigelow Bay swimming area is popular with the locals and directly below the parking area. The trail is well-used, narrow and somewhat rocky. Arrive at the old Molly Hughes mine workings and the old cabin that overlooks them. The rickety porch overlooks a significant drop-off and spectacular views of the lake and back to New Denver.<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The trail meanders 3-400m gradually down towards the beach and easy access. There is some private property above the beach, but there&#8217;s public right-of-way on the beach itself. It&#8217;s usually deserted. For a person who prefers to swim or catch some sun in solitude, this is the perfect place.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"post-body-7562974692462412069\" class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-vDBKKGlmPy4\/UBYWvTDsUJI\/AAAAAAAAFlg\/d8nBLwei_xQ\/s1600\/IMG_0110.JPG\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-vDBKKGlmPy4\/UBYWvTDsUJI\/AAAAAAAAFlg\/d8nBLwei_xQ\/s320\/IMG_0110.JPG\" width=\"320\" height=\"213\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The beach is full of smooth round stones in a variety of greys, whites, reds and coppery greens.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Mine and viewpoint.<\/strong> Either return the way you came or make a loop hike on the Galena Trail.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">B<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">ack to Bigelow Bay Park go for a swim<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">From the mine, a trail drops to a very old road that enters private property circling a large yellow Victorian house.

Note that the entire beach and the large first bench of the first house are Crown land and can be used legally by anyone. You would however not be very popular if you suntanned on this beach, much less camped on the bench.
