Ottawa is the\u00a0capital city\u00a0of\u00a0Canada. It is located at the\u00a0confluence\u00a0of the\u00a0Ottawa River\u00a0and the\u00a0Rideau River\u00a0in the\u00a0southern portion\u00a0of the province of\u00a0Ontario. Ottawa borders\u00a0Gatineau,\u00a0Quebec, and forms the core of the Ottawa\u2013Gatineau\u00a0census metropolitan area\u00a0(CMA) and the\u00a0National Capital Region\u00a0(NCR).<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>Ottawa is the political centre of Canada and headquarters to the federal government. The city houses numerous\u00a0foreign embassies, key buildings, organizations, and institutions of\u00a0Canada&#8217;s government, including the\u00a0Parliament of Canada, the\u00a0Supreme Court, the\u00a0residence of Canada&#8217;s viceroy, and\u00a0Office of the Prime Minister.<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>Founded in 1826 as\u00a0Bytown, and\u00a0incorporated\u00a0as Ottawa in 1855.<br \/>\nOttawa has the most educated population among Canadian cities\u00a0<sup id=\"cite_ref-natpost_17-0\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>and is home to a number of colleges and universities, research and cultural institutions, including the\u00a0University of Ottawa,\u00a0Carleton University,\u00a0Algonquin College, the\u00a0National Arts Centre, the\u00a0National Gallery of Canada; and numerous\u00a0national museums, monuments, and historic sites.<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>\u00a0It is one of the most visited cities in Canada, with over 11 million visitors in 2018.<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-citynews_19-0\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-citizennews_20-0\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup><strong>Rideau Centre.<\/strong> A large modern shopping mall near a major train stop giving best access to Parliament Hill, the Rideau Canal and Lower Town, the old part of Ottawa.<br \/>\nI stayed at\u00a0Ottawa Backpackers 05\/09-08\/09 $35\/night. It is in an old house.<br \/>\n<strong>Monument to the Aboriginal Soldier.<\/strong> On the west side of Confederation Park is this large bronze (base with bear, elk, bison and wold, 4 indigenous men topped off by a large eagle) on top of a large granite boulder. For WWI, WWII and the Korean War.<br \/>\n<strong>Byward Market.<\/strong> An old brick market occupying a narrow block. Has one aisle down the middle. The outside has many stores and eateries, streets pedestrianized, stores and food places on street.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Day 2\u00a0<\/span>Sept 6<br \/>\n<\/strong>Up early, I left the hostel at 08:30 heading for the Algeria Embassy to pick up my passport (have had it since Aug 9, refused to communicate, and have made this detour to Ottawa necessary. SUCCESS!!!!!!!!!! FOUR VISAS in 5 HOURS. I walked 1.6 km to the Algerian Embassy but it was not open till 09:30 (09:00 is advertised). I received my passport with the visa in 5 minutes. But Ernestine Chan\u2019s visa was not approved yet. \u201cBlue suit\u201d was very nasty and threw E\u2019s letter down (giving me permission to pick up her Hong Kong passport with the Algerian visa that had been at the embassy since 21\/07. Mine had arrived 09\/08), saying it wasn\u2019t signed. Another agent appeared and said it would be ready in 30 minutes. Apparently, the problem had been with our guide as approval for her visa had just arrived on 05\/09 (yesterday) because of delays in getting the permit for Djanet. I departed at 10:20. Note that the desert of Algeria is the highlight for coming to the country. There are some WHS and a few interesting things to see in the north but the magic is here. Apparently a permit to visit is required and because of being busy, the process at the Djanet end is very slow. Libya Embassy 11:00, left with business visa ($102.50 by debit) at 12:11. Chad Embassy 12:40, left with same day visa ($200) at 14:20. Great day!<br \/>\n<strong>Bank of Canada Museum.<\/strong> All about money. Note closed T, W. Free.<br \/>\n<strong>Monument to the Victims of Communism.<\/strong> Sitting behind a fence, is the base for this monument. It was never finished (under pressure from China?)<br \/>\n<strong>National Holocaust Monument.<\/strong> Opened in 2017, it appears to be an unattractive conglomeration of reinforced concrete. But inside are wonderful etchings on the concrete by Edward Buntynsky from 2014 on many walls. Treblinka &#8211; 900,000 Jews, 2000 Roma and Sinti. Track 17 Berlin. Auchwitz\/Birkenau fence &#8211; 960,000 Jews, 120,000 Poles, Roma, Sinti and Soviet prisoners of war. Hiding Place &#8211; Warsaw ghetto cemetery. Prayer Room &#8211; Theresienstadt Czech Republic.

Half of German Jews had fled before 1939.<br \/>\nCanada has little to be proud of. Less than 5000 Jews were accepted into Canada between 1933-1945. The SS St Louis was denied entry into Canada in June 1939 with 907 on board, 254 later died. After 1947, ~40,000 Jewish Holocaust survivors entered Canada.<br \/>\n<strong>Canada War Museum.<\/strong> 4 galleries and a special exhibit tell war since Boer War, WWI and II, Korea, Afghanistan. $16<br \/>\nPeace Tower Church. High silver tower. Closed.<br \/>\n<strong>Canadian Museum of Nature.<\/strong> In a wonderful old building, the highlight was the special exhibit on Planet Ice (archaeology of ice ages). $15 + $7 for Planet Ice.<br \/>\nOutside was a futuristic bench with the saying &#8220;Courage, my friends, &#8217;tis not too late to build a better world.&#8221; Tommy Douglas<br \/>\n<strong>Corktown Bridge.<\/strong> Crosses the Rideau Canal which is lined by a park on walkways on both sides of the canal.<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Day 3<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Notre Dame Cathedral Basilica.<\/strong> Built in 1847, it has skyline-dominating spires. The inside is a wonder of faux marble columns, elaborately decorated walls\/ceilings in the lateral naves, a cross-vaulted ceiling that is blue with yellow stars, Ways of the Cross are oil paintings and the altar a riot of statues and spires. The 2 rows of stained glass are very nice.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>National Gallery of Canada.<\/strong> I have seen this before, but wanted to see it again.
