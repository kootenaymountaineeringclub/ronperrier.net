A one-story house in the same park as the zoo and botanical garden. It contains portraits of him and his daughter as well as his sweets box, candlestick, and tobacco case.\u00a012,000 PG<br \/>\nDe Francia (1766-1840) was a\u00a0Paraguayan\u00a0lawyer and politician, and the first\u00a0dictator\u00a0(1814\u20131840) of Paraguay\u00a0<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>following its 1811 independence from the Spanish\u00a0Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata. His official title was &#8220;Supreme and Perpetual Dictator of Paraguay&#8221;, but he was popularly known as\u00a0<i>El Supremo<\/i>. He is considered to be the chief ideologue\u00a0and political leader of the faction that advocated for the full\u00a0independence of Paraguay\u00a0from the\u00a0United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata\u00a0and from the\u00a0Empire of Brazil.<br \/>\nAlthough he was dogged by suggestions that his father, a Brazilian tobacco exporter, was a\u00a0mulatto, Francia was awarded a coveted chair of theology at the Seminary of San Carlos in Asunci\u00f3n in 1790. His radical views made his position as a teacher there untenable, and he soon gave up theology to study law. Eventually, he became a lawyer and learned five languages:\u00a0Guarani, Spanish, French, Latin, and some English.<br \/>\nFrancia was disgusted by Paraguay&#8217;s\u00a0<i>casta\u00a0system<\/i>, which was imposed by Spain, and as a lawyer, he would defend the less fortunate against the affluent. Francia had the largest library in Asunci\u00f3n. His interest in astronomy, combined with his knowledge of French and other subjects considered arcane in Asunci\u00f3n, caused some superstitious Paraguayans to regard him as a wizard who could predict the future.<br \/>\nHe was one of the few men in the country with any significant education and soon became the country&#8217;s real leader. On 12 October 1813 Paraguay declared independence from the Spanish Empire.<br \/>\nIn March 1814, Francia imposed a law that no Spaniard may intermarry with another Spaniard, and that they may only wed mestizos, Amerindians, or Africans. This was done to eliminate any socioeconomic disparities along racial lines, and also to end the predominantly criollo and peninsular influence in Paraguay. He feared that racial disparities would create tensions that could threaten his absolute rule.<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>On 1 October 1814, Congress named him as sole consul, with absolute powers for three years. He consolidated his power to such an extent that on 1 June 1816, another Congress voted him absolute control over the country for life. For the next 24 years, he ran the country with the aid of only three other people. According to the historian Richard Alan White, the congresses were actually very progressive for the era; all men over 23 could vote for them.<br \/>\nHe cut off Paraguay from the rest of the world by stopping foreign commerce, but carefully fostered its internal industries and agriculture under his personal supervision. Dr. Francia disposed to be hospitable to strangers from other lands and kept them prisoners for years; lived a life of republican simplicity, and severely punished the slightest want of respect. As time went on he appears to have grown more arbitrary and despotic. Deeply imbued with the principles of the French Revolution, he was a stern antagonist of the church. He abolished the Inquisition, suppressed the college of theology, did away with the tithes, and inflicted endless indignities on the priests. He kept the aristocracy in subjection and discouraged marriage both by precept and example, leaving behind him several illegitimate children. For the extravagances of his later years, the plea of insanity has been put forward.&#8221; He imposed ruthless isolation upon Paraguay, interdicting all external trade, and he fostered national industries.<br \/>\nHe attempted to reorganize Paraguay in accordance with the wishes of the lower classes and other marginalized groups. He greatly limited the power of the Church and the landed elites in favor of giving peasants a way to make a living on state-run\u00a0<i>estancias<\/i>. Francia&#8217;s government also took over services usually under church supervision, such as orphanages, hospitals, and homeless shelters, to manage them more efficiently. Francia and his policies were in fact very well received by the majority of Paraguayans, excluding the small ruling classes, and his neutrality in foreign affairs kept peace in a period of turmoil.<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>In February 1820, Francia&#8217;s political police\u00a0quickly crushed a plot by the elites and many leading independence figures to assassinate him. Almost 200 prominent Paraguayans were arrested by Francia, who executed most of them.<br \/>\nFrancia outlawed all opposition and established a secret police force. His underground prison was known as the &#8220;chamber of truth&#8221;, and most of Paraguay&#8217;s manufactures were made with prison labor. He abolished flogging, but his implementation of the death penalty was brutal, as he insisted all executions be carried out at a\u00a0<i>banquillo<\/i>\u00a0(&#8220;stool&#8221;) under an orange tree outside his window. To avoid wasting bullets, most victims were bayoneted, and their families were not allowed to collect the corpses until they had been lying there all day to make sure that they were dead. Upon his death, there were 606 prisoners in Paraguay&#8217;s jails,\u00a0who were mainly foreigners.<br \/>\nFrancia abolished higher education on the grounds that it was the nation&#8217;s financial priority to fund the army and that private study could be freely conducted in his library. He made state education compulsory for all males in 1828.<br \/>\nFrancia lived a spartan lifestyle, and apart from some books and furniture, his only possessions were a tobacco case and a pewter confectionery box.\u00a0Francia left the state treasury with at least twice as much money in it as when he took office, including 36,500\u00a0<i>pesos<\/i>\u00a0of his unspent salary, the equivalent of several years&#8217; pay.<br \/>\n<sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><\/sup>Francia imbued Paraguay with a tradition of autocratic rule that lasted, with only a few breaks, until 1989. He is still considered a national hero, with a museum dedicated to his memory in\u00a0Yaguar\u00f3n. It contains portraits of him and his daughter as well as his sweets box, candlestick and tobacco case.\u00a0Paraguayan author\u00a0Augusto Roa Bastos\u00a0wrote an ambivalent depiction of the life of Francia, a novel entitled\u00a0<i>Yo el Supremo<\/i>\u00a0(<i>I, the Supreme<\/i>).<br \/>\n<strong>Botanical Garden and Zoo of Asunci\u00f3n.<\/strong> The zoo was disorganized to see but many birds, a coatamundi, puma, jaguars, many Bengal tigers and a hippopotamus.

Located 90km from Asuncion, the town of Sapucai is known for its fascinating railway complex. The town of Sapucai was constructed between 1887 and 1894, and became not just a station on the line, but where the steam locomotive trains were repaired and constructed.<br \/>\nThe history of the railway in Paraguay goes way back to the mid-nineteenth century British engineers were hired to be in charge. The main aim was to unite surrounding villages and the interior with the capital city in order to facilitate the marketing of natural resources of the country. It was on this railway line that the first-ever train journey took place in South America on 14th June 1861 from the central station in Asuncion.<br \/>\nThe railway system in Paraguay consisted primarily of a 376 km main line of standard gauge between the capital Asuncion and Encarnacion, a city located close to the Argentinean border. Since the opening of the railway line in 1861 to its culmination in 1919. In 1894 the railway complex of Sapucai was constructed complete with its station, a workshop, office buildings and warehouses. Engineering technicians from Britain came to Sapucai to work in the workshop, where repairs and assembling of the trains were carried out. To accommodate for the community of British railway engineers, an \u201cEnglish Village (Villa Inglesa)\u201d was built, which was an estate of houses near the railway complex. A school for the children of the British community was also built there, which was the first English-language school in the country.<br \/>\nIn the late twentieth century, the railway network of Paraguay came to a slow down and the railway route through Sapucai came to a halt. Many people lost their jobs, and a bustling town that was once full of energy eventually lost its vigor. However, the workshop still remained open despite the huge drop in the number of workers and activity, and continued to manufacture and provide needed parts for the steam locomotive trains that were still running in other parts of the country.<br \/>\nEven to this day the workshop continues its operation, despite the machinery being extremely old and long exceeding its useful life. The role of the workshop continues to hold great importance as the international market no longer has replacement parts for steam locomotive trains.<br \/>\nSince 2010, a project to restore the collapsing warehouse as a museum was started.<br \/>\nApart from the railway complex and the English Village, another big attraction in Sapucai is its beautiful landscape. It is surrounded by lush hills and the scenery is absolutely breathtaking. There was plenty of desalinated water and soil rich in humus (for rapid reforestation), which were essential in running a large steam-powered workshop. To add to the amazing landscape, there is also a mysterious stone path, \u201cTape Boli\u201d that runs from one of the hillsides, which was built by a group of Bolivian soldiers taken as prisoners and held captive in Sapucai during the Chaco War in the 1930s.<br \/>\nWith so much valuable history and fascinating landmarks, Sapucai possesses a unique charm not found anywhere else in the country.<br \/>\nThe railway complex of Sapucai is considered to be one of the world\u2019s finest examples of railway workplaces dedicated to the maintenance of steam locomotive trains.<br \/>\nThe railway complex and English Village demonstrate the railway\u2019s interaction with industry and culture in the day-to-day work of the railway.<br \/>\nThe complex has remained complete with its entire infrastructure, including a water tower, shed, turntable, and fuelling facilities. Such an ensemble is rare and deserves conservation and recognition of its values.<br \/>\nThis consists of 3 conjoined sheds with a lot of heavy machinery &#8211; hoists, lathes, drills, boilers and drive systems, a carpenter&#8217;s shop and many tools. Three old engines are inside and one outside. It has not been used for some time. 10,000PG<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sistema Ferrocarril Pte.

To build the first Paraguayan railway in 1854\u00a0British engineers were hired and sapper personnel of\u00a0the Paraguayan Army\u00a0worked.<br \/>\nThe works began in 1857 and a 415-meter section from the Army arsenals to the riverside wall near the\u00a0Port of Asunci\u00f3n\u00a0was used by horse-drawn foxes.\u00a0In 1859, the section extended to Plaza San Francisco (today\u00a0Plaza Uruguaya\u00a0) linking the wharf with the central customs office.<br \/>\nIn 1861, the section from the San Francisco station (today the Central Station) to Ybyraty (currently the Sant\u00edsima Trinidad neighborhood) and the section to Luque station were inaugurated and at the beginning of 1862 it reached Aregu\u00e1.\u00a0On March 27, 1862, it reached Guaz\u00fa Vira (Yparaca\u00ed) and two months later Piray\u00fa.\u00a0On July 24, 1864, the Central Station was inaugurated.

In 1894 the works on the Sapucai railway workshops were completed.\u00a0In 1909 the American Percival Farquhar acquired most of the railway&#8217;s shares.<br \/>\nTo establish a link with the\u00a0Ferrocarril Nordeste Argentino, the line from the Pirap\u00f3 River to\u00a0Encarnaci\u00f3n\u00a0was completed in 1913 using the same gauge used by the Argentine railway\u00a0(1435 mm).<br \/>\nIn 1914, the branch between San Salvador and Eugenio A.

Seven of these missions were located in Paraguay and the rest in the present-day countries of Argentina and Brazil. The mission complexes were attached to\u00a0settlements and are evidence of a unique urban scheme. While each period had a singular style, all combined indigenous elements with Christian attributes and symbolism exhibiting Baroque, Romanesque and Greek influences, as part of an unprecedented process of acculturation.<br \/>\nThe Jesuits arrived in the Guayr\u00e1 in 1588. With the permission of King Philip II of Spain, the missionaries\u2019 goal was to Christianize the indigenous population as well as to protect them from the colonial labour system of\u00a0encomienda, a condition of virtual slavery. The inhabitants were brought together and encouraged to adopt a sedentary form of life and the Christian religion but unlike other missions in the New World, they were not forced to \u201cEuropeanize\u201d. Many indigenous traditions were retained and encouraged such as the cultivation of yerba mate, which continues to be a representative regional product today.<br \/>\nThe missions are located about 10 kilometres apart. Although today the missions are essentially archaeological ruins, their original layout followed, generally, a similar form with the church providing the basic unit, the urban core and the centre of spiritual life. Next to the church stood the residence of the Fathers, with the houses of the Caciques close by. The rest of the mission was composed of the yard, cloisters of workshops, garden, the\u00a0Tupa Mba\u00e9, cemetery, and jail. Adjacent to the church, there was a large square facing the four cardinal points, with crosses or statues and shrines in the four corners. Streets 16 or 18 meters in width radiated from the squares. The houses for the indigenous residents were arcaded blocks 60 meters square.<br \/>\n<strong>Mission of Sant\u00edsima Trinidad del Paran\u00e1<\/strong> stands as the best-preserved urban complex. Although it was established in 1706, later than many of the\u00a0reducci\u00f3n, it was also the most ambitious of the missions with a complex of buildings covering an area of about 8 hectares. The large stone church had a fine dome and impressive decoration. It was built around 1745 In addition to the main church, evidence survives of the small church, college or school, cloister, cemeteries, kitchen gardens, belfry, native houses, and workshops.<br \/>\nThis was one block from my accommodation in Trinidad<\/p>\n<div id=\"item-5d62a3d331149d00015aa277\" class=\"sqs-layout sqs-grid-12 columns-12\" data-layout-label=\"Post Body\" data-type=\"item\" data-updated-on=\"1566748884447\">\n<div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1649725130405_102\" class=\"row sqs-row\">\n<div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1649725130405_101\" class=\"col sqs-col-8 span-8\" data-content-ads-inserted=\"true\">\n<div id=\"block-21a7914da163667bdfc1\" class=\"sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image sqs-text-ready\" data-block-type=\"5\">\n<div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1649725130405_100\" class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1649725130405_99\" class=\" image-block-outer-wrapper layout-caption-hidden design-layout-inline combination-animation-none individual-animation-none individual-text-animation-none \" data-test=\"image-block-inline-outer-wrapper\">\n<figure id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1649725130405_98\" class=\" sqs-block-image-figure intrinsic \">\n<div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1649725130405_97\" class=\"image-block-wrapper\" data-animation-role=\"image\">\n<div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1649725130405_96\" class=\"sqs-image-shape-container-element has-aspect-ratio \"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"thumb-image loaded\" src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5a87961cbe42d637c54cab93\/1566746831901-5DCPI2AVSBXF9HBAGRE4\/jesuit-missions-paraguay-guide.jpg?format=2500w\" alt=\"Here is our travel guide on how to visit Jesuit Missions Ruins in Paraguay from Encarnacion.\" data-src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5a87961cbe42d637c54cab93\/1566746831901-5DCPI2AVSBXF9HBAGRE4\/jesuit-missions-paraguay-guide.jpg\" data-image=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5a87961cbe42d637c54cab93\/1566746831901-5DCPI2AVSBXF9HBAGRE4\/jesuit-missions-paraguay-guide.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"1280x853\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5d62a8ce199ab60001632e6f\" data-type=\"image\" data-image-resolution=\"2500w\" \/><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>Jes\u00fas de Tavarangue<\/strong> survives as an archaeological ruin dating to about 1588.

It has a population of 7 million, nearly 3 million of whom live in the\u00a0capital\u00a0and largest city of\u00a0Asunci\u00f3n, and its surrounding metro. Although one of only two landlocked countries in South America (Bolivia is the other), Paraguay has ports on the\u00a0Paraguay\u00a0and\u00a0Paran\u00e1\u00a0rivers that give exit to the Atlantic Ocean through the Paran\u00e1-Paraguay Waterway.<br \/>\nSpanish\u00a0conquistadores\u00a0arrived in 1524, and in 1537 established\u00a0Asunci\u00f3n.\u00a0During the 17th century, Paraguay was the center of\u00a0Jesuit missions, where the native\u00a0Guaran\u00ed people\u00a0were converted to Christianity and introduced to European culture.[10]\u00a0After the\u00a0expulsion of the Jesuits\u00a0from Spanish territories in 1767, Paraguay increasingly became a peripheral colony, with few urban centers and settlers. Following\u00a0independence from Spain\u00a0in the early 19th century, Paraguay was ruled by a series of authoritarian governments characterized by nationalist, isolationist and\u00a0protectionist\u00a0policies. This period ended with the disastrous\u00a0Paraguayan War\u00a0(1864\u201370), during which the country lost half its prewar population and around 25\u201333% of its territory to the\u00a0Triple Alliance\u00a0of Argentina,\u00a0Brazil\u00a0and\u00a0Uruguay. In the 20th century, Paraguay faced another major international conflict\u2014the\u00a0Chaco War\u00a0(1932\u201335) against Bolivia\u2014in which it prevailed. Afterwards, the country came under a succession of military dictators, culminating in the 35-year regime of\u00a0Alfredo Stroessner, which lasted until his overthrow in 1989 by an internal military coup. This marked the beginning of Paraguay&#8217;s democratic era, which continues to this day.<br \/>\nParaguay is a\u00a0developing country.\u00a0The majority of Paraguay&#8217;s seven million people are\u00a0mestizo, and Guarani culture remains widely influential; more than 90% of the population speak various dialects of the\u00a0Guarani language\u00a0alongside Spanish. Despite a history of poverty and political repression, in a 2017 Positive Experience Index based on global polling data, Paraguay ranked as the &#8220;world&#8217;s happiest place&#8221;.<br \/>\nEtymology. From\u00a0Guarani\u00a0paragu\u00e1\u00a0&#8220;feather crown&#8221; and\u00a0y\u00a0&#8220;water&#8221; thus\u00a0paragua\u00ed\u00a0&#8220;feather crown of waters&#8221;.<br \/>\n<strong>HISTORY<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Pre-Columbian era.<\/strong> The\u00a0indigenous\u00a0Guaran\u00ed\u00a0had been living in eastern Paraguay for at least a millennium before the arrival of the\u00a0Spanish. They were not fully pacified until the late 19th century.<br \/>\n<strong>Colonization.<\/strong> The first Europeans were Spanish explorers in 1516 and\u00a0Asunci\u00f3n\u00a0was founded in 1537.<br \/>\nJesuit\u00a0missions in the eighteenth century brought Guarani populations together at Spanish missions to protect them from virtual slavery by Spanish settlers and Portuguese slave raiders, the\u00a0Bandeirantes, in addition to seeking their conversion to Christianity. They flourished until \u00a0expulsion of the Jesuits by the Spanish Crown in 1767. The ruins of two 18th-century\u00a0Jesuit Missions of La Sant\u00edsima Trinidad de Paran\u00e1 and Jes\u00fas de Tavarangue\u00a0have been designated as\u00a0World Heritage Sites\u00a0by\u00a0UNESCO.<br \/>\n<strong>Independence and rule of Francia.<\/strong> Paraguay overthrew the Spanish in 1811. New laws greatly reduced the powers of the Catholic church. Colonial citizens were forbid from marrying one another and allowed them to marry only blacks,\u00a0mulattoes\u00a0or natives in order to break the power of colonial-era elites and to create a\u00a0mixed-race\u00a0or mestizo society.<br \/>\n<strong>Rule of the L\u00f3pez family. <\/strong>Carlos Antonio L\u00f3pez\u00a0came to power in 1841. L\u00f3pez modernized Paraguay and opened it to foreign commerce. He signed a\u00a0non-aggression pact\u00a0with Argentina and officially declared independence of Paraguay in 1842. After L\u00f3pez&#8217;s death in 1862, power was transferred to his eldest son,\u00a0Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez.<br \/>\nThe regime of the L\u00f3pez family was characterized by pervasive and rigid centralism in production and distribution. There was no distinction between the public and the private spheres, and the L\u00f3pez family ruled the country as it would a large estate.<br \/>\nThe government exerted control on all exports. The export of\u00a0yerba mate\u00a0and valuable wood products maintained the balance of trade between Paraguay and the outside world.\u00a0The Paraguayan government was extremely protectionist, never accepted loans from abroad and levied high\u00a0tariffs\u00a0against imported foreign products. This\u00a0protectionism\u00a0made the society self-sufficient, and it also avoided the debt suffered by Argentina and Brazil. Slavery existed in Paraguay, although not in great numbers, until 1844, when it was legally abolished in the new constitution.<br \/>\nThe ruling family had almost total control of all public life in the country, including church and colleges. In terms of socio-economic development, the country was dubbed as &#8220;the most advanced Republic in South America&#8221;.<br \/>\nL\u00f3pez&#8217;s government was comparatively a good one for Paraguay: life and property was secure, crime almost unknown, and when committed, immediately detected and punished. The mass of the people was, perhaps, the happiest in existence. They had hardly to do any work to gain a livelihood. Each family had its house or hut in its own ground. They grew tobacco, maize and mandioca for their own consumption, oranges, a few cows and were almost throughout the year under little necessity<br \/>\n<strong>Paraguayan War (1864\u20131870)<\/strong> In 1864, Brazil\u00a0(allied with the Argentinia) invaded Uruguay<br \/>\nThe Paraguayans attacked Mato Grosso\u00a0in 1864 and later declared war against Argentina on in 1865 and the\u00a0Argentine Republic, the\u00a0Empire of Brazil\u00a0and the Republic of Uruguay signed the\u00a0Secret Treaty of the Triple Alliance\u00a0against the Paraguayan Government on.<br \/>\nThe Paraguayans put up a ferocious resistance but ultimately lost in 1870.<br \/>\nParaguay lost 25\u201333% of its territory to Argentina and Brazil, paid an enormous war debt, and sold large amounts of national properties to stabilize its internal budget. The worst consequence of the war was the catastrophic loss of population. At least 50% of the Paraguayans died during the conflict, numbers which took many decades for the country to return to. Of between 450,000 and 900,000, only 220,000 survived the war, of whom only 28,000 were adult males.<br \/>\n<strong>20th century.<\/strong> In 1904 the Liberal revolution against the rule of Colorados broke out. The Liberal rule started a period of great political instability. Between 1904 and 1954 Paraguay had thirty-one\u00a0presidents, most of whom were removed from office by force.[37]\u00a0Conflicts between the factions of the ruling Liberal party led to the\u00a0Paraguayan Civil War of 1922.<br \/>\nThe unresolved border conflict with Bolivia over the Chaco region finally erupted in the early 1930s in the\u00a0Chaco War. After great losses Paraguay defeated Bolivia and established its sovereignty over most of the disputed Chaco region. Dissatisfaction resulted in the\u00a0Paraguayan civil war of 1947.\u00a0In its aftermath\u00a0Alfredo Stroessner\u00a0began involvement in a string of plots, which resulted in his military\u00a0coup d&#8217;\u00e9tat of 4 May 1954.<br \/>\n<strong>Stroessner era, 1954\u20131989. <\/strong>Paraguay was modernized to some extent under Stroessner&#8217;s regime, although his rule was marked by extensive human rights abuses. Torture and death for political opponents was routine.<br \/>\nThe splits in the\u00a0Colorado\u00a0Party in the 1980s, and the prevailing conditions \u2013 Stroessner&#8217;s advanced age, the character of the regime, the economic downturn, and\u00a0international isolation\u00a0\u2013 were catalysts for anti-regime demonstrations and statements by the opposition prior to the 1988 general elections.<br \/>\n<strong>Stroessner&#8217;s overthrow, post-1989. <\/strong>In 1989, Stroessner was overthrown in a military coup and, hundreds of the rural poor immediately occupied thousands of acres of unused territories belonging to Stroessner. The 1992 constitution established a democratic system and dramatically improved protection of fundamental human rights.<br \/>\nElection of Fernando Lugo in 2008 set its two major priorities as the reduction of corruption and economic inequality. He was Impeached in 2012 as a &#8220;politically motivated coup d&#8217;\u00e9tat&#8221;.<br \/>\n<strong>Present-day.<\/strong> President Mario Abdo enjoys a close relationship with the Brazilian far-right president since 2019,\u00a0Jair Bolsonaro.\u00a0In February 2019, President Mario Abdo Benitez was at Bolsonaro&#8217;s side when Bolsonaro praised Paraguayan military dictator Alfredo Stroessner, calling him &#8220;a man of vision.&#8221;<br \/>\n<strong>GEOGRAPHY<br \/>\n<\/strong>Paraguay is divided by the\u00a0R\u00edo Paraguay\u00a0into two well-differentiated geographic regions. The eastern region (Regi\u00f3n Oriental); and the western region, officially called Western Paraguay (Regi\u00f3n Occidental) and also known as the Chaco, which is part of the\u00a0Gran Chaco. The country lies between latitudes\u00a019\u00b0\u00a0and\u00a028\u00b0S, and longitudes\u00a054\u00b0\u00a0and\u00a063\u00b0W.<br \/>\nThe terrain consists mostly of grassy plains and wooded hills in the eastern region. To the west are mostly low, marshy plains.<br \/>\n<strong>Climate.<\/strong> The overall climate is\u00a0tropical\u00a0to\u00a0subtropical with wet and dry periods. Winds play a major role in influencing Paraguay&#8217;s weather: October and March, warm winds blow from the Amazon Basin in the north and between May and August cold winds from the Andes.<br \/>\nThe absence of mountain ranges to provide a natural barrier allows speeds as high as 161\u00a0km\/h (100\u00a0mph). This also leads to significant changes in temperature within a short span of time; between April and September, temperatures will sometimes drop below freezing. January is the hottest summer month, with an average daily temperature of 28.9.<br \/>\nRainfall varies dramatically with substantial rainfall in the east, and semi-arid conditions in the far west.<br \/>\n<strong>Politics.<\/strong> Paraguay has\u00a0compulsory military service; all 18-year-old males are liable for one year of\u00a0active duty.<br \/>\n<strong>ECONOMY<br \/>\n<\/strong>In 2010 and 2013, Paraguay experienced the greatest economic expansion of South America, with a GDP growth rate of 14.5% and 13.6% respectively.<br \/>\nLess than 10% of workers in Paraguay participated in the\u00a0pension\u00a0system. All of\u00a0Paraguay&#8217;s electricity\u00a0is generated by\u00a0hydropower, making it one of the\u00a0cleanest in the world. Paraguay has an installed electricity production capacity of 8,110 MW, producing 63 billion kWh\/year in 2016; with domestic consumption of just 15 billion kWh, the excess production is sold to Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay, making Paraguay the world&#8217;s largest exporter of electric power.\u00a0This production is from two large\u00a0hydroelectric power\u00a0projects along its borders, including the\u00a0Itaipu Dam, the world&#8217;s second-largest generating station.<br \/>\nParaguay is the fifth-largest\u00a0soybean\u00a0producer in the world,\u00a0the second-largest producer of\u00a0stevia\u00a0and the ninth-largest exporter of\u00a0beef.<br \/>\nThe market economy has by a large informal sector, featuring re-export of imported consumer goods to neighboring countries, as well as the activities of thousands of microenterprises and urban street vendors. Nonetheless, over the last 10 years the Paraguayan economy diversified dramatically, with the energy, auto parts and clothing industries leading the way.<br \/>\nParaguay&#8217;s biggest cities are located along the\u00a0Argentina-Paraguay border:\u00a0Asunci\u00f3n,\u00a0Encarnaci\u00f3n,\u00a0Pilar\u00a0and\u00a0Ciudad del Este, the latter being the third most important free commercial zone in the world, only trailing behind\u00a0Miami\u00a0and\u00a0Hong Kong.\u00a0A large percentage of the population, especially in rural areas, derives its living from agricultural activity, often on a subsistence basis.<br \/>\nIndustry and manufacturing includes the production of\u00a0cement,\u00a0iron ore, and\u00a0steel.<br \/>\nParaguayan companies meet 70% of domestic consumption of drugs and have begun to export drugs.<br \/>\n<strong>SOCIAL ISSUES. <\/strong>Various poverty estimates suggest that 30\u201350% of the population is poor.\u00a0In rural areas, 41.20% lack a monthly income to cover basic necessities, whereas in urban centers this figure is 27.6%. The top 10% of the population holds 43.8% of the national income, while the lowest 10% has 0.5%. The economic recession has worsened income inequality.<br \/>\nMore recent data show that 35% of the Paraguayan population is poor, 19% of which live in extreme poverty. Moreover, 71% of the latter live in rural areas of the country.<br \/>\n10% of the population controls 66% of the land, while 30% of the rural people are landless.\u00a0In the immediate aftermath of the 1989 overthrow of Stroessner, some 19,000 rural families occupied hundreds of thousands of acres of unused lands formerly held by the dictator and his associates by mid-1990, but many rural poor remained landless. This inequality has caused many tensions between the landless and landowners.<br \/>\nIn the 2010s, the economy, largely directed towards soybean production, grew by an average of 4%. The economic growth did not, however, reduce poverty. According to The New York Times, Paraguay is &#8220;one of the countries in Latin America where the gap between rich and poor has widened the most in recent years.&#8221; In the countryside, 85% of agricultural land is owned by 2.6% of the owners. In addition, people of indigenous descent have been expelled to make way for soybean companies.<br \/>\nThe soybean export market is largely dominated by multinationals (Cargill,\u00a0Archer Daniels Midland,\u00a0Bunge Limited, etc.) and therefore benefits few Paraguayans. Export companies and landowners pay little tax. Paraguay is one of the countries where companies participate the least in the state budget.<br \/>\nPesticides and other chemicals are used heavily in soybean fields. The high level of political corruption, the extreme fragility of institutions, the high level of social vulnerability, the omnipotence of economic interests in political decisions, as well as the location in the geographic heart and its abundance of natural resources, make Paraguay an attractive target for imperial geopolitical interests. The country&#8217;s politicians &#8220;are subsidized by big business; they are the ones who implement the policies.<br \/>\n<strong>Social issues of the indigenous.<\/strong> Literacy rates are 7.1% compared to the 51% rate of the general population. Only 2.5% had access to clean drinking water and only 9.5% had electricity as of 2002.<br \/>\n<strong>DEMOGRAPHICS<br \/>\n<\/strong>Paraguay&#8217;s population is distributed unevenly through the country, with the vast majority of people living in the eastern region near Asunci\u00f3n. The\u00a0Gran Chaco\u00a0region accounts for about 60% of the territory but has less than 2% of the population. About 56% of Paraguayans live in urban areas, making Paraguay one of the least urbanized nations in South America.<br \/>\nGerman Paraguayans include 25,000 German-speaking\u00a0Mennonites\u00a0living in the Paraguayan\u00a0Chaco.\u00a0They founded several towns, such as\u00a0Hohenau,\u00a0Filadelfia,\u00a0Neuland,\u00a0Obligado\u00a0and\u00a0Nueva Germania. Paraguay received\u00a0waves\u00a0of\u00a0Slavic people.\u00a0Paraguay has also been a haven for communities persecuted for the religious faith, like the\u00a0Bruderhof\u00a0who were forced to leave England in 1941 because of their pacifist beliefs.\u00a0Many of these communities have retained their languages and culture, particularly the\u00a0Brazilians, who represent the largest and most prominent immigrant group, at around 400,000.\u00a0Many Brazilian Paraguayans are of German, Italian and Polish descent.\u00a0There are an estimated 63,000\u00a0Afro-Paraguayans, comprising 1% of the population.<br \/>\nTraditionally, the majority of the Paraguayan population is considered mixed (mestizo\u00a0in Spanish). Paraguay has a population of 6,956,066, of which 95% are Mestizo or white and 5% are labelled as &#8220;other&#8221;, which includes members of 17 distinct ethnolinguistic indigenous groups, many of which are poorly documented.<br \/>\nReligion. 89.9% Catholic, 6.2%\u00a0Evangelical Protestant, 1.1% other Christian sects, and 0.6% practiced indigenous religions<br \/>\n<strong>Languages. <\/strong>Paraguay is a bilingual nation &#8211; Spanish and\u00a0Guaran\u00ed\u00a0are official languages. The Guaran\u00ed language is a remarkable trace of the indigenous Guaran\u00ed culture that has endured in Paraguay. Guaran\u00ed is one of the last surviving and thriving of South American indigenous national languages. In 2015, Spanish was spoken by about 87% of the population, while Guaran\u00ed is spoken by more than 90%, or slightly more than 5.8 million speakers. 52% of rural Paraguayans are bilingual in Guaran\u00ed.<br \/>\n<strong>Health.<\/strong> Average life expectancy in Paraguay is rather high given its poverty: as of 2006, it was 75 years.\u00a0equivalent to far wealthier Argentina, and the eighth highest in the Americas according to World Health Organization.<br \/>\n<strong>CULTURE <\/strong>Paraguay&#8217;s cultural heritage can be traced to the<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/d\/d2\/Itaipu_geral.jpg\" alt=\"Itaipu_geral.jpg (3593\u00d72283)\" \/>extensive\u00a0intermarriage\u00a0between the original male Spanish settlers and indigenous\u00a0Guaran\u00ed\u00a0women with more than 93% mestizos, making Paraguay one of the most homogeneous countries in Latin America<br \/>\nArts such as embroidery (ao po&#8217;\u00ed) and\u00a0lace making\u00a0(\u00f1andut\u00ed).
