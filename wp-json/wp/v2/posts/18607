It was May 2010, and the then 29-year-old lobbyist had just given birth in an emergency caesarean section in a Virginia hospital. Upset that the delivery hadn\u2019t gone as planned, Burnside was determined to get breastfeeding right. After all, decades of research have shown that breast milk\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nccdphp\/dnpao\/features\/breastfeeding-benefits\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">confers vital nutritional and health benefits to babies<\/a>, including protection from illnesses like diabetes and from sudden infant death syndrome.<\/p>\n<p>But that didn\u2019t go according to plan either. Burnside both nursed and then pumped her breast milk around the clock to keep her supply flowing, just as she had learned in the 45-minute class she had taken while pregnant. But after a couple weeks, her son\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/americanpregnancy.org\/healthy-pregnancy\/first-year-of-life\/newborn-weight-gain\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">still wasn\u2019t gaining weight<\/a>. The pediatrician urged her to feed him more; she was advised to supplement with formula if she couldn\u2019t produce enough breast milk. But Burnside refused to give up on breastfeeding exclusively.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ResponsiveWrapper\">\n<aside class=\"InlineElement InlineElement--below-paragraph InlineElement--page-width InlineElement--desktop InlineImage\" aria-label=\"Image\" data-bumper-index=\"1\">\n<div class=\"CopyrightImage\">\n<figure class=\"Image aspect-ratio--parent InlineImage--image\">\n<div class=\"RatioFrame aspect-ratio--auto\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"Image__Wrapper Image__Wrapper--relative\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/i.natgeofe.com\/n\/5a9d4d16-49c8-4c45-a678-5c7ad37b939c\/JenniferMcClure_final_01.jpg?w=2303.9999389648438&amp;h=1535.3999593257904\" alt=\"The mother holds her young daughter's hand next to a breast pump in a studio scene.\" data-mptype=\"image\" \/><\/div><figcaption>\n<div class=\"Caption__Wrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption\">\n<div class=\"Caption__TextWrapper\">\n<div class=\"Caption__Text\" aria-live=\"polite\"><span class=\"Truncate Truncate--collapsed\"><span class=\"RichText\">Jennifer McClure and daughter Esme with the breast pump she was issued during an extended hospital stay.

Yet after three months, a typical amount of time U.S. women take for maternity leave, less than half are still exclusively breastfeeding\u2014and only a quarter do so for the six months that the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends. Many begin supplementing with formula or switch entirely.<\/p>\n<p>Although estimates suggest that only about five to 10 percent of women are physiologically unable to breastfeed, many more say that they\u2019re either not making enough or there\u2019s something nutritionally lacking with their milk that keeps the baby from thriving. Yet there has been surprisingly little research into how lactation goes awry\u2014and, as most experts will tell you, similarly little support for women who are trying to breastfeed. In contrast to the dairy industry, which has funded extensive studies of lactation in cattle, researchers have barely scratched the surface with human milk.<\/p>\n<p>In recent years, however, research is gaining momentum as scientists investigate factors like genetics, environmental exposures, and diet, hoping to yield answers for future generations of mothers.<\/p>\n<p>The science is evolving so fast, I think the next decade is going to be really cool to be in this field,<\/p>\n<p>Seeking her own answers, Burnside went to see an endocrinologist to figure out if she might have insulin resistance, which she heard\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.diabeteseducator.org\/news\/perspectives\/adces-blog-details\/amy-campbell-rd-cde\/2013\/07\/10\/breast-milk-production-and-insulin-resistance#:~:text=Women%20who%20are%20challenged%20by,samples%20of%20human%20breast%20milk.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">could cause low milk supply<\/a>. Although tests revealed that she had some markers for polycystic ovary syndrome, which can cause insulin resistance, the endocrinologist told her she didn\u2019t need\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/medical-professionals\/endocrinology\/news\/metformin-revisited\/mac-20430448\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">medication to improve her insulin sensitivity<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/magazine\/article\/womens-health-concerns-are-dismissed-more-studied-less-feature\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i>Women\u2019s health concerns are dismissed more, studied less<\/i><\/a><i>.<\/i>)<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, Burnside joined a support group where she found encouragement\u2014but no answers. She continued to breastfeed, but reluctantly supplemented with formula. \u201cI was still really floundering,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<h2>The biology of breastfeeding<\/h2>\n<p>Breastfeeding may seem simple to the casual observer\u2014a woman lifts the child to her breast and the baby latches on and takes over from there, right? But as mothers know, lactation is a complex process that can go wrong in any number of ways.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s really a finely tuned orchestration of different hormones that are binding to their very specific receptors and driving very specific reactions. Anything that interferes with these reactions will shut down lactation, sometimes within hours.<\/p>\n<p>Breasts only become fully mature during pregnancy, which floods the body with a cocktail of hormones that prompts the milk-making machinery to develop. Mammary glands are like a bunch of grapes: the milk ducts are the stems and the hollow spaces where the milk accumulates\u2014the grapes\u2014are called alveoli. There are about a dozen of these clusters in each breast, and each one contains two types of cells. The cells inside the alveoli produce milk, and muscle cells surrounding these structures contract, pushing the milk into the ducts.<\/p>\n<p>When the baby is born, the removal of the placenta triggers a sudden drop in the hormone progesterone, which turns on milk production.<\/p>\n<p>It takes another complex sequence of events to release the milk. When a baby suckles at the nipple, it activates sensory nerve impulses in the mother\u2019s body that release both prolactin and oxytocin. These hormones then encourage the cells of the mammary gland to release milk. To keep the lactation process going, the baby must nurse regularly or the mammary gland will return to its pre-pregnancy state.<\/p>\n<h2>How breastfeeding goes wrong<\/h2>\n<p>By the time Burnside was pregnant with her second child, in 2012, she had a much better understanding of breastfeeding: Her struggles feeding her firstborn had inspired Burnside to switch careers and enroll in a nursing program to study lactation.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn my mind that was going to be the big game-changer,\u201d she says. Unlike her first pregnancy, Burnside went into the delivery room armed with the knowledge of all the potential \u201cbooby traps,\u201d as she calls them, that can get in the way of making enough milk. Those include waiting too long feed the newborn child and offering formula instead of the breast in the earliest days of life.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s a very critical time for establishing lactation. Experts\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.unicef.org\/stories\/breastfeeding-first-hour-birth-what-works-and-what-hurts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recommend<\/a>\u00a0breastfeeding within an hour of birth to start the hormone signaling process. Offering formula also deprives the newborn of colostrum\u2014the first form of breast milk the body produces for two to four days after birth, which is packed with vital nutrients, antibodies, and antioxidants.<\/p>\n<p>Many women can overcome their milk supply issues with support and education. Like Burnside, most first-time parents receive only basic training in breastfeeding\u2014and most medical schools offer little training on the science of lactation. Many hospital\u2019s lunchtime education sessions on breastfeeding <a href=\"https:\/\/www.liebertpub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1089\/bfm.2021.29197.alk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">were led by formula company representatives<\/a>. (In February 2023,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/series\/breastfeeding-2023\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a series of papers published in\u00a0<i>The Lancet<\/i><\/a>\u00a0further outlined these and other marketing strategies of the commercial milk formula industry.)<\/p>\n<p>If parents and doctors were better informed, it may put them more at ease. For one, they might worry less about a low milk supply if they understood that the amount of milk they produce varies with the baby\u2019s stage of development\u2014and sometimes the baby doesn\u2019t need much. And while many parents supplement with formula when milk seems low, this can backfire and drop milk production further.<\/p>\n<p>You have to have been signaling from the start every time your baby is hungry in order for your body to know that it should and needs to and will produce milk. It can take weeks to build back up your supply. It\u2019s not like a light switch that you just turn on and off.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes the challenge might also be on the baby\u2019s side. Conditions like a tongue tie\u2014when a band of tissue tethers the tip of the tongue to the floor of the mouth\u2014can keep a baby from adequately stimulating the nipple.<\/p>\n<p>New parents shouldn\u2019t be forced to navigate all these potential issues themselves, Kellams says. She advocates for access to lactation consultants, who can troubleshoot, as well as institutional support like paid maternity leave, which makes the nonstop feeding-and-pumping routine more feasible.<\/p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/magazine\/article\/sweden-paid-parental-leave-fathers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>A glimpse into the lives of families under Sweden&#8217;s generous parental leave policy<\/i><\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>But even access to excellent health care isn\u2019t going to be enough for all women. It wasn\u2019t for Burnside. She made it through about two weeks of breastfeeding her second child before the pediatrician warned her that something more needed to be done. At two weeks, infants typically drink\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthychildren.org\/English\/ages-stages\/baby\/feeding-nutrition\/Pages\/How-Often-and-How-Much-Should-Your-Baby-Eat.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">two to three ounces every couple of hours<\/a>.

Of these, researchers know the most about diet. Obesity and malnutrition both affect the body\u2019s hormone levels, and a mother\u2019s diet can influence the fat and vitamin profile of her milk. This is why many breastfeeding women take nutritional supplements and are encouraged to consume a healthy diet and avoid sudden calorie deficits.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s increasing curiosity about the role that antioxidants might play as well in reducing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fphys.2020.00694\/full\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">oxidative stress<\/a>, a state in which rogue electrons in the body \u201cbasically start attacking different parts of the cell.\u201d If those electrons kill cells in the mammary gland, that can shrink the alveoli and return them to a pre-pregnancy state.

That\u2019s partly due to the same gender discrimination found elsewhere in health care, but Kelleher says resolving breastfeeding challenges generally doesn\u2019t seem urgent to funders who consider formula an adequate back-up in an emergency. Recent formula shortages\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nutrition\/infantandtoddlernutrition\/formula-feeding\/infant-formula-shortage.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">have exposed the weaknesses in that argument<\/a>, but the tides seem to be turning all the same.<\/p>\n<p>Technology has taught scientists in recent years that human milk \u201cis rich with not only nutrients but all these bioactives that influence the health of the baby, its growth and maturity, and its development.<\/p>\n<p>And funding is beginning to trickle in. In 2020, the Gates Foundation supported the creation of the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.milcresearch.com\/imic.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">International Milk Composition Consortium<\/a>, which is focused on how to optimize the nutritional value of human milk. Around the same time, the National Institutes of Health\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nichd.nih.gov\/research\/supported\/begin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">established its own working group on breastmilk ecology<\/a>. The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine is also developing an agenda to address the key parental questions about lactation.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019re not doing it just for the sake of the cool science involved. Better insight into the biology of human milk could be life-changing for millions of women around the world and their children\u2014particularly those in low-income settings where malnutrition is common.<\/p>\n<p>For Burnside, any revelations that come of this research will be too late for her family. Three years ago, she gave birth to her third child, boosting her own mastery of breastfeeding by becoming a certified lactation consultant.<\/p>\n<p>Burnside had experienced a postpartum hemorrhage\u2014a rare condition in which a woman experiences heavy bleeding in the days after birth that\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/full\/10.1111\/1552-6909.12198#:~:text=Background,a%20delay%20in%20breastfeeding%20initiation.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">is known<\/a>\u00a0to delay lactation.
