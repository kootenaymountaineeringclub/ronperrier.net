Paris<\/strong> is one of the loveliest cities in the world. There must be detached houses (with grass and some land around it) but I have never seen one. Everyone lives in a 6-story apartment building. Apartments are not cheap.<br \/>\n<strong>2. Dog poo.<\/strong> It is much better than the other two times I have been here but one still must watch where you walk.<br \/>\n<strong>3. Smoking.<\/strong> It must have the highest percentage of smokers than any country in Europe.<br \/>\n<strong>4. Metro.<\/strong> Very efficient and gets you everywhere cheaply. Buy the Navigo card to save money and for convenience. Make sure to carry the small extra card with your photo. I lost mine and it cost me 50\u20ac.<br \/>\n<strong>5. Paris Museum Pass.<\/strong> A great deal. I bought the 4-day pass for 66E and have paid for it 3 times over (I see a lot of museums). But some are not covered (M Hommes, Galeria M and others), but most are covered. At 10-15E per museum, it doesn&#8217;t take much to make it work well. Note that it is a 24-hour card and is not good on day 5 before it was first activated.<br \/>\n<strong>6. Food.<\/strong> There must be a million restaurants but they are not cheap. It is impossible to find a hamburger for less than 17E and they are typical European hamburgers &#8211; too much bun, no pickles or mustard or bacon), a few pieces of lettuce as a &#8220;salad&#8221;. Wine is expensive. Burger King is much better &#8211; a double cheese with bacon for 11E and a much better burger.<br \/>\n<strong>7. SIM card.<\/strong> 15GB for one month cost 15\u20ac. It registered and activated when put into your phone!<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nDay 1, 2<\/strong> Nov 14-15, 2022. Paris Orly to Paris Charles de Gaulle. No bus. TVG to Antony to CDG 21.30 euro<br \/>\n<em>I had a very uncomfortable night sleeping in the airport \u2013 all chairs had arms so I alternated between sitting in a chair and lying on the hard floor. <\/em><br \/>\n<em>I was in Paris to get the carry-on backpack I had left at CDG on November 4<sup>th<\/sup>. I had received a message that they had found my bag on Nov 6 but would not answer any emails or phone calls. After endless tries I was able to talk to a real human (use the Air France reservation number) and make a claim but never had a tracking number or any way to make sure the bag was there. So it was somewhat of a risk to fly all the way from Central African Republic (for CAD$900). <\/em><br \/>\n<em>At 9, I was at the lost luggage which was ferme and then walked all over to find how to access it. I returned to Lost Luggage and got them to open the door. With only a description of the bag, I finally got their attention when I said I had well over $2000 in the bag. After a long search, they asked where the money was. It then took an hour for them to find the money by basically taking everything out of the pack. Along with the money, there was several years of accumulated travel stuff \u2013 a sleeping bag, Thermarest mat, silk sleep sheet, hiking shoes and endless other stuff that was difficult to replace.<\/em><br \/>\n<strong>Metro\/train pass.<\/strong> I bought the Paris Navigo card (5\u20ac + a 22.80\u20ac top up). It requires a small photo to purchase.<br \/>\n<em>I finally left CDG at noon, took the train to Gare Nord and 2 metros to my hostel, home for 2 nights to see all the Nomad Mania sites I had missed on my previous two trips to Paris. I also needed a visa to go to Guinea Bissau, proceed to Gambia and finish all of West Africa (other than Equatorial Guinea \u2013 I hate having these single left over single countries but this is an impossible visa).<\/em><br \/>\n<em>I had a late lunch at a busy sidewalk caf\u00e9, The Saint Jean \u2013 cheeseburger 17.50\u20ac &#8211; good for a European hamburger, but it will be hard getting used to European prices.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>MONTMARTRE.<\/strong> <em>This is a lovely district with cobble streets, few cars, lovely shops and many cafes with sidewalk seating.<\/em> 3 NM sites<br \/>\n<strong>Montmartre Funicular.<\/strong> It rises 36m up the hill to Sacred Coeur Basilica. Originally built in 1900 when it operated hydrologically, it was rebuilt in 1991 to run on electricity. There are two cars moving up and down at the same time taking 1\u00bd minutes. 2 million people take it yearly. 1.90 Euro each way. Take the 197 steps down.<br \/>\n<strong>Sacred Coeur Basilica.<\/strong> Built between 1878-85, this is a wonderful grand church on top of Montmartre Hill. Inside there is a huge central dome. The highlight are the wonderful mosaics in chapels, a huge one over the altar and many small mosaics adorning most surfaces. All the wood is quarter-cut oak. There are great views south over Paris.<br \/>\n<strong>La Pigalle.<\/strong> Hip Pigalle is famous for its neon-lit red-light district and eclectic nightlife, from the 19th-century cabaret Moulin Rouge to glam cocktail bars. South of Boulevard de Clichy, contemporary bistros give way to grand 19th-century neoclassical buildings that earned the area the nickname of Nouvelle Ath\u00e8nes (New Athens). Notable art museums include the Mus\u00e9e National Gustave Moreau and the Mus\u00e9e de la Vie Romantique.<br \/>\nMuch sketchier than Montmartre, there are many more cars and cheap restaurants.<br \/>\nI bought a SIM card \u2013 15 gigs, 1 month for 15E. It registered and activated itself.<br \/>\n<strong>ON<\/strong> Plug-Inn, Montmartre. 35\/night including breakfast. I didn\u2019t make a reservation but had to book and pay online as it was not possible at the desk. I could only stay 2 nights as it was booked out. It is large with 6 floors and the tiniest elevator in the world holding only one person with luggage. Rooms were nice with comfortable beds.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 3<\/strong> 16\/11. <em>This was a big walk-about day seeing as many NM sites as possible (in this order). It has been some time since I walked much. It rained lightly, then quit and then rained heavily from mid afternoon on. I was very knackered when I got back to my hostel after having pizza for dinner. <\/em>27 NM sites.<em><br \/>\n<\/em>I purchased the <strong>Paris Museum Card<\/strong> \u2013 4 days, 66E. Buy at any participating museum or online. Activates with first use. It probably paid for itself on the first day.<br \/>\n<strong>Grand Opera.<\/strong> Italian-style opera house with ceiling painted by Chagall &amp; library museum in 19th-century building. An over-the-top building with painted ceilings, great statues and lots of marble. In the Palais Garnier. 14E (not covered in Museum Card)<br \/>\n<strong>Grand Synagogue<\/strong>. Landmark 1,800 seat synagogue built in 1874 and seat of French chief rabbi. Open M,T, and Thursday 9-12 and 2-4. No reservations necessary.<br \/>\n<strong>InterContinental Paris Le Grand Hotel.<\/strong> A large hotel that I walked all over. Lovely big sitting area under a large glass roof. I try to go to the bathroom in all these lovely buildings.<br \/>\n<strong>Hotel Westminster<\/strong>. Small 5-star hotel, smaller, less ostentatious than most of the others. Cheapest room was 550E.<br \/>\n<strong>Hotel Ritz Paris<\/strong>. A huge hotel on Place Vendome with a great copper column in the centre of the square out front. One of the few hotels that I couldn\u2019t get past the front door. Cesar Ritz lived from 1850-1918.<br \/>\n<strong>Hotel de Vendome.<\/strong> Presently under renovation but can still open for business.<br \/>\n<strong>Hotel Le Meurice<\/strong>. Another 5-star hotel.<br \/>\n<strong>Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs<\/strong>. A huge museum. Large exhibit on Elsa Shiaporelli, a luxury fashion designer with a store from 1933-53 and bought by Tod\u2019s in 2006. Etiene Robial, graphic artist. Large parts on Renaissance and then by century to modern \u2013 furniture, ceramics, glass. Pass<br \/>\n<strong>Hotel Regina<\/strong>. Another 5-star hotel. Hard to get past the lobby.<br \/>\n<strong>Ministry of Culture and Communication.<\/strong> A six story building with a decorative, abstract metal grill covering the front and sides.<br \/>\n<strong>Saint Eustache Church<\/strong>. A grand Gothic church with extremely high ceilings and grey stone. The side chapels are a riot of decoration.<br \/>\n<strong>Galeries Lafayette.<\/strong> 5 locations in Paris. A large department store.<br \/>\n<strong>La Samaritaine<\/strong>. A high-end department store, wrought iron frame, seven stories, glass roof, all stairs.<br \/>\n<strong>Pont Neuf.<\/strong> Road bridge crosses the Seine with an island at its west end (with Notre Dame, La Chapelle and the Martyrs memorial on its east end)<br \/>\n<strong>Sainte-Chapelle<\/strong>. Ornate 13<sup>th<\/sup> century Gothic chapel built by Louis IX with relics and notable stained glass windows of Biblical scenes, vaulted ceilings and ornate decor. A small area at the bottom of a very high church that wasn\u2019t entered. Built in the 13<sup>th<\/sup> century in the middle of a palace, now the courthouse. Pass<br \/>\n<strong>Memorial des Martyrs de Deportation.<\/strong> At the east tip of the island, it is a holocaust memorial, with great small vignettes portraying concentration camps. Has an eternal lit crystal.<br \/>\n<strong>La Tour d&#8217;Argent Restaurant.<\/strong> Centuries old quayside emblem of French cuisine famed for its house-special pressed duck. Built in 1582. On the south bank of the Seine.<br \/>\n<strong>Institut du Monde Arab<\/strong>. Striking, 10-story building with latticed windows, housing Islamic cultural exhibitions, plus cafe. On the river side is a long curve with a separate totally glass cube behind.<br \/>\n<strong>Maison de Victor Hugo<\/strong>. The house he lived in from 1832-48. All the interior was auctioned off in 1852 so little original. 230 square metres over 2 floors. Pass<br \/>\n<strong>Place des Vosges. <\/strong>Oldest planned square in Paris, lined with trees and red brick houses, built by Henri IV in 1612.<br \/>\n<strong>Pavillon de la Reine Hotel.<\/strong> High end hotel in an elegant building offering a fitness center and a refined lounge bar. Behind very high-end art galleries and a small courtyard that couldn\u2019t enter.<br \/>\n<strong>Musee Carnavalet.<\/strong> The history of Paris in a huge museum spread over 3 floors. Free<br \/>\n<strong>Museum of the Art and History of Judaism.<\/strong> High security. All individual labels in French but good larger story boards. Told of all the banishments.

Pass<br \/>\n<strong>Mus\u00e9e Picasso.<\/strong> 17<sup>th<\/sup> century building with 5000 works by Picasso, his own art collection and archive. I hate Picasso and simply don\u2019t get it. The most interesting was the second floor with many photos and art of his family, especially his daughter Maya. Pass<br \/>\n<strong>Mus\u00e9e de la Chasse et de la Nature<\/strong>. Private 12E and not worth the price. <strong><br \/>\nMus\u00e9e des Arts et M\u00e9tiers.<\/strong> Converted church with scientific and industrial artworks (many machines from windmills through steam) and artefacts including Foucault\u2019s pendulum (hangs from the ceiling high above and swings. Due to the earth\u2019s rotation, its arc changes slowly and knocks over bullet casings, one by one. Pass<br \/>\n<strong>Arts et M\u00e9tiers Metro Station.<\/strong> Not sure why it is in this list, as it is little different than many old statins \u2013 white tile with nice arched roof.<br \/>\n<strong>ON<\/strong> The People &#8211; Nation X 3 nights. In the far SE of the city, It is a huge 5 story hostel with a market next door. The Nation has a large circle. There are good views of the Eiffel Tower from here &#8211; at night the lights intermittently shimmer and there is a great search light on top.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 4<\/strong> 17\/11. <em>I had another big walk-about.
