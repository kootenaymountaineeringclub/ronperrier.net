It is about 700m south of Mt Isis (9250&#8242;) at 8300&#8242; elevation. <\/em><\/em><em><em>It seems unlikely that it is the largest arch in the world. The authority is the Natural Arches &amp; Bridges Society &#8211; from photographs, the estimate was 110 feet.\u00a0<\/em><\/em><em><em><br \/>\nIt is visible only from the west side of Monica Meadows as the south ridge of Mt Amen-Ra separates the basin at the base of the arch from Monica Meadows and you have to be far enough back (ie west) to see over that ridge. Often the arch just peaks over it through a low point.<br \/>\nIt is important to differentiate arches from bridges &#8211; bridges are formed by flowing water and arches aren&#8217;t. Because of this, it is difficult for arches to be as big as bridges and the three largest bridges (not arches and all in China) are longer than 100m.

Descend southeast over bogs and streams aiming for a talus field. Follow the talus heading northeast. Climb to the couloir to access the next drainage. From the top, you\u2019ll see the arch and the lake at the base of it. This was a surprisingly easy three-hour hike.<br \/>\nFrom the lake closest to the arch, hike up the talus, make the awkward move past the bollard and cautiously step through loose gravel and stones to reach the main corner that leads to the arch. The rock in the corner is too chossy to climb but there\u2019s good quality rock on the slab about five metres to the climber\u2019s left. Start there.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Climb:<\/strong><br \/>\n<em><strong>Grizzly Groove<\/strong><\/em>, AD, 5.7, 300m (7 pitches), gear to 3\u201d.<br \/>\n<em><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">FA: J. Caton, S. Ogle, V. Hempsall, July 26, 2017<\/span><\/em><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Gear: 1 full set of Black Diamond camalots from 0.2\u201d to 3\u201d plus doubles of a #1 and #2. Gear belays. Two 60-metre ropes and webbing are necessary for rappels.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">P1. 5.7, 45m: There are many loose rocks at the base of the route as well as spread throughout different sections so tread lightly and be aware of your rope. Start 4 metres to the left of the main corner and climb the low-angle slab to a large ledge.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">P2: 5.5, 60m: Continue up the slab, placing small pieces in discontinuous cracks to a small stance.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">P3: 5.5, 60m: Same as above.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">P4: 5.7, 60m: The wall steepens slightly here. Continue up and then veer right to a stance about 20m under the south side of the arch.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">P5: 5.7, 20m: Move up through the large loose blocks to a stance beside a triangle-shaped horn on the north side of the arch.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">P6: 5.7, 60m: Step right, then downclimb three metres before traversing right and into a dihedral. Place gear then continue up and right to another fist-sized corner crack. Follow this to its termination then step left into easy terrain to the top. The quality of rock on this pitch is spectacular and the jamming is excellent.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">P7: If you\u2019re so inclined, climb onto the top of the arch. From a spot about 10m down the east side of the main ridge make an awkward move over a chasm onto the arch proper and climb the easy terrain (5.7) making sure to go over the large boulder feature rather than around it. Descend the way you came to the main ridge.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Descent:<\/strong> There\u2019s a small tree one metre below the main ridge that\u2019s northwest of the north side of the arch. Using two 60m ropes, lower off that to another larger tree about 38 metres directly below. From there do another ~35m rappel, trending skier\u2019s right, to a slung horn. From that station keep lowering the skier\u2019s right for about 55m to a large group of trees. The next rap is a full 60m and deposits you on the large ledge where your first anchor was located. There\u2019s a two-nut anchor there and another 55m rap takes you to near the base of the route. (Be careful of loose rock.) One more 20m rap off an anchor left behind made of two stoppers and a #1 cam leaves you at the top of the snow field. (We rappelled off a snow bollard at the peak of the snow field to avoid hiking down the slippery slope. A 60m rap landed us about 20m above the rock talus.)<\/span><\/h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">By Vince Hempsall, the online editor for Mountain Culture Group and the managing editor of\u00a0<em>Kootenay Mountain Culture Magazine<\/em>.
