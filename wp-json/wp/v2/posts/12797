Costs in Central African Republic are exorbitant for foreigners as much must be flown or shipped in. Many of the supermarkets in Bangui and other cities are owned by Lebanese, so there is abundant Middle Eastern food imported.<br \/>\nThe country is made up of vast swathes of tropical rainforest that make it popular for exploring. Should the CAR ever emerge from the grip of conflict &amp; dysfunctional government, the country could be an appealing ecotourism destination (similar to Gabon). Dzanga-Sangha NP is the highlight of the country. Controlled by WWF, the ecosystem is intact with many wildlife opportunities. It is not uncommon to see 70 forest elephants at once, the largest number of lowland gorillas in Africa and much other game. Access is complicated and very difficult. Stay at expensive eco-lodges.<br \/>\nBamingui-Bangoran National Park and Manovo-Gounda St.Floris National Park are promising wildlife reserves that are in insecure regions and without facilities.<br \/>\nAs with most of Africa, local markets can be a feast for the eyes, offering a wide arrangement of crafts. Just be vigilant, as markets in the CAR are rife with petty and violent theft.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Capital:<\/strong>\u00a0Bangui.

I arrived in Lome LFW at 13:00, after my flight had left. But Asky had a flight from Lome to Douala and Bangui that was delayed (that was actually my original flight that had not left but it took a while to figure that out). It eventually left at 18:20 for a long day of waiting in airports. I ended up talking to Donald a man from Douala also flying from Sao Tome.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>So I was back in Douala with another transit to CAR the next day and stayed in the VIP lounge again for 20,000 CFA.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Observations Central African Republic<br \/>\n1. Why come here?<\/strong> For me the only reason to come here was to get another country and passport stamp. Our &#8220;tour&#8221; only saw Bangui, Boali Falls (quite spectacular) and one pygmy village &#8211; hardly worth the price. In retrospect, it might be worthwhile to simply go to Dzanga-Sangha NP and skip the rest &#8211; arrange a charter flight through one of the lodges (time it with a group for cost savings) and stay for 3-4 days to see an untouched park with a great selection of wildlife. I talked to a Spanish women &#8211; they paid 120\u20ac\/night in their lodge.<br \/>\n<strong>2. Poverty.<\/strong> CAR is 192\/193 in GDP and probably 193\/193 in GDP (ppp) second only to Burundi. The poverty is grinding with virtually all the economy informal. As it is landlocked, most everything arrives by plane or truck from Cameroon &#8211; and so is also surprisingly expensive. Our 2 star hotel was 70\u20ac per night.<br \/>\n<strong>3. Safety:<\/strong> Walk around town during day time and early nighttime and feel safe (no cell phones or computers, take off watches and jewelry).<br \/>\nEasy to grab a cheap moto (&lt;500 XAF within Centre Ville). Observe your surroundings for possible thieves and robbers. Warned of corrupt overzealous police but was not bothered by them, was told to carry and show passport and visa copies rather than the original to not be extorted. Was also advised to be firm and stand my ground with any bad cops, once again did luckily not face the issue.<br \/>\n<em>I was sitting in our passenger van with the window open. I had been taking a video out the window; A guy reached in and got my phone sitting on my lap. I ran after him and with help bought the phone back for 10,000 ($17). Several guys grabbed at my pockets as I walked back to the van. The port\/market is known for its pickpockets.<\/em>Safety (see below). Petty thievery and pickpockets are very common. If go out leave everything but a few CFA in your pocket.<br \/>\n<strong>4. Roads<\/strong> are surprisingly good, at least the ones in Bangui and to the waterfall. Going to the pygmy villages though required a 4WD.<br \/>\n<strong>5. Military presence.<\/strong> <em><strong>UN:<\/strong><\/em> armed UN vehicle are common. A large convoy of big trucks was loaded with armoured vehicles, dump trucks. At the airport, there were several UN prop planes and a helicopter. I talked to a woman who had worked for the UN in CAR for 7 years. The UN here is completely dysfunctional as any managers were black and hire only friends and relatives. She had little job satisfaction and wanted to leave.<br \/>\nLocal military are also common in trucks with machine guns.<br \/>\nWagner Group were also common in trucks with very heavy machine guns &#8211; recognizable by their balaclavas covering their lower face.<br \/>\n<strong>6.<\/strong> <strong>Photography<\/strong>. Photography is viewed with suspicion and disliked not just with the police or army around the usual sensitive locations (government buildings, infrastructure, checkpoints), but by regular people just about everywhere. Taking photos conspicuously will draw negative attention and you should ask for permission to take anyone\u2019s photo\u2014even in public places.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 1 Thur Nov 10.<\/strong><br \/>\n<em>Flight DLA Cameroon to Bangui @ 11:40-13:00. Rwand Air.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>At immigration, we filled out a form about Covid symptoms but did not have to show our expensive PCR tests (mine cost 110\u20ac in Sao Tome). Walk outside and enter the immigration office. Fill out another basic form. Present the LOI and get a stamp (no full page visa). Then go to a window on the left to pay 30,000 CFA visa fee. None of us had CFA or the correct change and Jude paid for all of us to get our passports.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>I bought a coke at one of the &#8220;bars&#8221; outside the gate &#8211; cost 2000 CFA.

Most live in the western parts of the country.<br \/>\nBangui manufactures\u00a0textiles, food products,\u00a0beer,\u00a0shoes, and\u00a0soap.<br \/>\nBangui has been the scene of intense rebel activity and destruction during decades of political upheaval, including the recent\u00a0rebellion. In 1996 it was the most dangerous in the world.<br \/>\nFamed in colonial times as one of the most agreeable cities in equatorial Africa, Bangui blends wooded hills and grassy meadows with heavily populated shantytowns, a handsome if now somewhat run-down city centre, and modern residential districts. Though strikes and curfews often bring the city to a standstill, Bangui enjoys a vibrant nightlife and a diverse musical culture.<br \/>\n<strong>Wifi<\/strong> &#8211; It has been impossible to get a wifi connection. Even if places have a positive signal, none connect &#8211; our hotel, coffee shops. Our guide had a SIM card and I was able to finally connect and book my flight to Paris.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Artisanal Market. <\/strong>The local crafts were very good. Hard woods carved into all sorts of animals, boxes, coaster sets, fruit plates and lovely wood pieces in &#8220;sun&#8221; pictures. A large selection of masks, some painted. Butterfly art &#8211; plants in frames with whole butterflies, mosaics in place mats, pictures (I can&#8217;t imagine the number of butterflies it would take to make one place mat). Paintings (nothing great). Leather goods especially alligator bags, wallets. Cloth and clothing in typical African designs.\u00a0<strong><br \/>\nBangui Notre Dame Cathedral. <\/strong>It is a large and elegant church built totally of red brick and is common type in French tropical colonies. Three nave with 7 columns a side. On a Thursday afternoon at 4, it was relatively full.<\/p>\n<p>Dinner. La Tourangelle. On the river, fair food with excellent French fries and mayonnaise. Steak a little tough (overdone) but tasty.\u00a0<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong>ON Oubangui Hotel &#8211; \u20ac70\/night. It\u2019s 3-star (2-star by European standards).<br \/>\nRooms are basic but have a balcony with a full river view. There\u2019s also a hotel bar next to the river to enjoy a local beer. Included breakfasts were fairly good.<br \/>\nThe hotel sits on the edge of the very wide Ohbangui River with a small rocky peninsula jutting out into the river. There is an island close to the DRC side and rapids between the peninsula, the island and the DRC side. A parade of narrow dug out canoes is constantly crossing the river. Each has one or two passengers and small amounts of produce.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mus\u00e9e Ethnograhique Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Boganda in\u00a0Bangui\u00a0<\/strong>is the country\u2019s national museum and has a decent collection of local instruments, weapons, tools, and displays about local traditions, religion, and architecture.<br \/>\n<strong>National Stadium<\/strong> \u2013 (dilapidated) football stadium should be on any walking tour, you can walk inside the grounds and have a look around.<br \/>\n<strong style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Port \/ Market<\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"> \u2014 really dodgy and not recommended because of pickpockets. A tourist was kind of \u201crobbed\u201d by a guy walking past who snatched a 500 ml water bottle. That\u2019s pretty desperate stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>There are two Tentative World Heritage Sites in Bangui:<br \/>\n<strong>The Hill and the Plain, the Oubangui River and the built Colonial Heritage of the City of Bangui<\/strong> (11\/04\/2006).<br \/>\n<strong>The paleo-metallurgical sites of Bangui<\/strong> (04\/11\/2006). Archaeological studies\u00a0in and around Bangui have yielded at least 26 ancient\u00a0Iron Age\u00a0sites that contain many\u00a0metallurgical tools and objects, illuminating the pre-European history of the city and surrounding area.<br \/>\nThe site closest to Bangui is <strong>Pendere-Sengue<\/strong>, 800 metres (2,600 ft) from Independence Avenue. Several thousand shards of ceramics, iron tools, pottery, and an iron spatula weighing 9 kilograms (20 lb) have been unearthed. It&#8217;s dating, compared with similar sites in Nigeria and Sudan, could be close to the 9th century BC.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 Fri Nov 11.<\/strong> Bangui &#8211; Baoli Falls (85 km) &#8211; Bangui Oubangui River boat ride.<br \/>\n<strong>Boali Falls.<\/strong> 43 miles and a day trip from the capital, this picturesque series of waterfalls is more impressive in the rainy season. On the M\u2019Bari River, they fall from a nearly vertical cliff of schist 50 m high and 250 m wide. There are various viewing platforms and also the opportunity for a short slippery hike down to the base of the falls.<br \/>\nThere are built hydroelectric power plants upstream and downstream from the falls that supply Bangui with electric power. Due to this the stream is scarce on weekdays but on Sundays, the dam is opened and the falls become more impressive.<br \/>\nGo down along the falls, taking the steps hollowed into the rock. A steep path then takes you to the rapids below. Resist the temptation to bathe: the lake is swarming with crocodiles.<br \/>\n<em>It was a 2 1\/2 hour drive to the falls. it rained hard all the way and when we are at the falls. They are very impressive and wide, separated into 3 falls by rock islands. Everyone took a hundred selfies from the steps and small lookouts down the side of the fall.\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>We have a &#8220;picnic&#8221; in a large pavilion and then drove back to Bangui. The sellers we passed are grim &#8211; little stands under umbrellas, gasoline in small bottles, bags of charcoal,\u00a0 simple home goods, and piles of rocks someone is trying to sell. The houses are one-room cinder block with thatch roofs and women and children sitting about in the dirt. The further from Bangui, the only vehicles are convoys of big trucks from Cameroon, motorcycles (carrying big drums and gigantic sacks) and small trucks loaded with goods and people riding on top. There are few cars and no share vans and many people walking on the road. Guys use push carts with narrow wheels as the main local freight hauling method. The usual places make iron railings, adobe bricks, cut wood and home furniture (beds).\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>The men and women all have short hair. The women&#8217;s hair is all in tight braids; there are no attachments. The poverty is grinding with everyone making a living in the casual economy. Most men are just sitting around. CAR is the second poorest country in the world (behind Burundi).\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em>As we near the city, there are many more cars and a few share vans.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Boat cruise on the Oubangui River.<\/strong> We boarded a large double layer boat and crossed the double set of rapids upstream. We passed close to the CAR side, passing a few villages with many dugout boats on the shore, some laden with fruit. All the kids screamed and were excited to see a bunch of white folks. A few guys were loading boats with sand dredged up from the bottom in buckets. There were many fishing nets in the river.<br \/>\nThere are two tiny ports with 2 cranes each, one with many Maersk containers. But neither appear to be used much. It appears that little arrives by river and most everything is trucked in from Cameroon.<\/p>\n<p><em>In town, we went on a fruitless search for an ATM and an internet cafe, sitting for a long time in a lovely coffee\/bakery shop. Everyone has a wifi signal but no one has a connection. R bought a SIM card that doesn&#8217;t work. I hot spot Jude and after several attempts finally am able to book a flight out of this hell hole.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 Sat Nov 12.<\/strong> Bangui \u2013 Zinga (125km) &#8211; Mbaiki (village relies on coffee and timber production) 85km for overnight<br \/>\n<strong>Pygmy communities<br \/>\n<\/strong>Mbaikiin in the rainforests surrounding the town,\u00a0about 30km dirt road south. Visits and stays are probably the biggest draw for the country\u2019s few tourists. Get a motor driver to Mbaiki -3 hours each way jam-packed with cool stuff.\u00a0Possible activities include: hunting with traditional weapons\/devices, gathering medicinal plants with the women of the village, and participating in a night of music &amp; dance. The pygmy communities here have a lifestyle is not as traditional as of those living near Dzanga-Sangha.<br \/>\nOther separate villages. Yombo, Kikongo, and Ibengue. Kikongo is 55km from Bangui. The pygmies are friendly, French-speaking, and perform a traditional dance. Some tourists have had a village football match after donating balls &amp; clothes.<br \/>\nThe forest and the AKA pygmy reference residential camps in the Central African Republic (04\/11\/2006)<br \/>\nON Oubangui Hotel 70\u20ac payable in Euros.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 Sun Nov 13.<\/strong> Mbaiki pygmy village &#8211; M&#8217;beko forest &#8211; Bangui (arrive at 1 pm), depart international flight.<br \/>\n13\/11 Flight Royal Air Maroc: AT284 BGF-ORL at 08:30 with a stopover in Douala (thankfully I don&#8217;t have to deplane and deal with the mess in DLA airport) to Casablanca at 16:15.

After a train ride to Charles de Gaulle to get my lost luggage, I plan on staying Paris for a few days before flying home?<\/p>\n<p>Our guide &#8220;no first name&#8221; Jude X X was very mediocre. One meal in Bangui was at a restaurant (had to pay for our own pop) that was good. All the rest were buffet picnics and of poor quality. He didn&#8217;t do anything not included on the itinerary &#8211; get SIM cards, hot spot his SIM card and help others with problems (although we had some completely unreasonable people in the group). He didn&#8217;t deliver on the pygmy villages &#8211; arrived at one but couldn&#8217;t see the other because we didn&#8217;t have a 4WD. But basically this is such a poor country to come to, most things are hard.<br \/>\nBut he is little different than the guides arranged by Ernestine Chan on this seven-country tour through West Africa. Out of the seven, 6 of her operators were basically crooks, little different than her. Only our Algerian guide was an honest guy.<\/p>\n<p><em>I met two astonishing travellers &#8211; astonishing because of their profound ignorance. <\/em><br \/>\n<em>R, a 30 something from Los Angeles on our trip (who is surprisingly well traveled for an American), described herself as a conservative Christian.

In the NM \u201cThe Dark Side\u201d series, it is located in a palm-tree grove 50 miles from the country&#8217;s decrepit capital, the crumbling palace of Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa, the cannibalistic self-styled emperor of the Central African Republic, has seen better days.<br \/>\nSummer rains flood the secret underground quarters of the &#8220;imperial court&#8221;. Madame Bokassa&#8217;s Italian bathroom tiles are chipped and the kitchen where chefs allegedly cooked the emperor&#8217;s political rivals, often serving them to visiting foreign dignitaries, is alive with rats.<br \/>\nThe bedroom in which Bokassa slept, supposedly surrounded by piles of gold and diamonds, still bears the bullet holes of the French, who stormed the palace when they ousted him in 1979. A huge building resembling a ship, which was home to the president&#8217;s spies, stands empty.<br \/>\nBut all this may change. The 62 children of Emperor Bokassa I, who were once the elite of this impoverished country but who now live in rags in the palace grounds, want to turn the building into a tourist attraction. &#8220;We are very poor. The palace is all we&#8217;ve got left,&#8221; said Jean Mboma, a grandson of Bokassa.<br \/>\nThe Central African Republic attracts few tourists &#8211; only 4,000 last year. Even the hardiest of backpackers are deterred by the prevalence of banditry and the lack of anything interesting to see or do .<br \/>\nBut relatives of Bokassa, who died in 1996, and some government officials believe it is not only foreign visitors who can benefit from visiting Bokassa &#8220;attractions&#8221;. Central Africans need to know their history too, they say. &#8220;He is an important character in the development of our country. We need to preserve that history, whether it&#8217;s good or bad,&#8221; said Albertine Dounia, head of the national museum in Bangui.<br \/>\nExpatriates recall Bokassa&#8217;s ruinous 13-year reign with fondness. &#8220;Things worked under Bokassa. The roads were good and the country was safe. The Central African Republic at that time was Africa&#8217;s best-kept secret,&#8221; said one diplomat. Indeed, the former French president Giscard d&#8217;Estaing enjoyed hunting trips with Bokassa.<br \/>\nCentral Africans often cite the university, sports stadium, and sparse network of roads as achievements of the Bokassa era. But not everybody remembers with nostalgia the ruler who clubbed to death several children and who spent the equivalent of his country&#8217;s annual GNP on an extravagant coronation.<br \/>\nResidents of Kolongo, the location of one of Bokassa&#8217;s villas, said that living next to the dictator was terrifying. &#8220;My brother, who was a teacher, was walking home one night past the palace grounds. He was taken inside. We never saw him again. It was a frightening time,&#8221; said Sima Fugaston, who makes a living selling the tall grasses which grow in the derelict den of the lions the president once kept.<br \/>\n&#8220;He used to scoop up beggars in his plane and drop them into the river,&#8221; recalled a university professor.<br \/>\nExhibitions on Bokassa are outlawed in the country and his belongings, such as his gold-plated bed, are in the national museum&#8217;s basement.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nDZANGA-SANGHA NATIONAL PARK.<br \/>\n<\/strong><em>2 days drive from Yaounde, Cameroon to CAR or <\/em><em>2 days from Bangui. <\/em><em>Or charter a 6-person plane for Euros 2000-2400. <\/em><em>It is a high price to see elephants, easily seen in many other places.
