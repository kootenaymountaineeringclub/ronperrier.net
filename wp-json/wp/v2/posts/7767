From Kaslo Lake, ascend switchbacks past the junction for Enterprise Pass. Views appear back down to the cabin and lake with Kokanee Glacier and Sawtooth Ridge in the distance.<br \/>\nCross Griffin Creek on large stones and pass Griffin Lakes at the base of Mount Giegerich. The trail climbs up to Lemon Pass and a field of boulders and streams. The Sapphire Lakes at the base of Glory Basin finally appear. The upper lake drains into the lower lake over a series of small waterfalls.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What to Do.<\/strong><br \/>\n1. Climb <strong>Mt Giegerich <\/strong>(2440m \/ 8005\u2019)\u2013 a 180m scramble from Lemon Pass.<br \/>\n2. <strong>Glory Basin<\/strong> is a wonder of tiny tarns and streams. Two kilometres above Upper Sapphire Lake, the basin tops out at the pass (2397m \/ 7864\u2019) between Sunset Mt and Outlook. Mt John Carter forms the east boundary of Glory Basin.<br \/>\n3. Climb any or all of <strong>Sunset Mt<\/strong> (2607m \/ 8553\u2019), <strong>Outlook Mt<\/strong> (2591m \/ 8501\u2019), or<br \/>\n<strong>Mt John Carter<\/strong> (2610m \/ 8563\u2019).<br \/>\n4. Descend to Lemon Creek via <strong>Nilsek Creek<\/strong> accessed from the pass at the top of Glory Basin. The top of the rudimentary trail down Nilsik Creek is found high on the north side of the pass between Sunset and Outlook. It is important to find the trail as the bushwhack otherwise is distinctly unpleasant (I once broke my ankle doing it). The advantage of coming out this way is avoiding the Lemon Creek headwall and the washed-out bridge.<br \/>\nIf a shuttle were arranged, this would be a long loop as a day hike or more pleasantly a multiple-day backpack camping at Kaslo Lake and Sapphire Lakes or upper Glory Basin.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Trail:<\/strong>\u00a0<strong>0.0<\/strong> From Gibson Lake, start on the old mining road leaving from the NE corner of the parking area.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">3.3km Keyhole Trail<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">4.5km South end Kokanee Lake 1975m (6480&#8242;). 1.5 hours.

After Kokanee Lake, traverse these meadows.

Larger, this has the main campground with 10 sites. Walk to the NE corner of Kaslo Lake. Go left for a 10-minute ascent to Enterprise Pass. Right goes 1.4km to Slocan Chief Cabin.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">8.2km Enterprise Pass 2017m (6650&#8242;).

The trail goes south and descends to broad subalpine <strong>Lemon Pass<\/strong>. Proceed straight across the open expanse toward a stand of subalpine fir, once the Sapphire Lakes campground with room for 2 tents, a cooking stand, metal food cache, wastewater drain and a green plastic toilet. Now all but the toilet are gone. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">10km Lower Sapphire Lake 2238m (7340&#8242;).
