Even though it was the birthplace of democracy, literature, mathematics, drama, philosophy \u2013 you name it, it was done here first. But that was 2300 years ago. Now it seems routed in a past. An alphabet that nobody else in the world uses \u2013 this has got to hold them back educationally: 2 alphabets to learn, little access to the much of the world\u2019s literature and in business where most of the world functions in English. The Greek Orthodox church has a lot of power and most of the country seems quite religious. School kids do all the crossing and kissing of icons. The church does not believe the people are pious enough. The mass is unusual with no sermon and much ritual, just a lot of chanting and incense waving by invisible priests behind an altar screen. This is when most western countries are turning away from religion.<br \/>\nIn my 13 years of travel, I have never met a Greek, so they seem to be xenophobic and don\u2019t travel much. <strong><br \/>\n1. Greek architecture. <\/strong>When one thinks of Greece, they imagine stark white cubist houses with blue roofs cascading down a cliff to the turquoise Aegean Sea \u2013 ie Santorini. But that only exists in Santorini. Otherwise it is one of the least interesting countries architecturally I have been to \u2013 no cute little villages filled with stone houses and narrow lanes. Most Greek houses tend to be 2-story square boxes and few look really old.<br \/>\n<strong>2. Archaeological Sites.<\/strong> These are a dime a dozen and few are interesting: all crumbling small walls, no roofs, and a few columns with no capitals. All take great imagination to visualize what was once there. This is all quite understandable. The Classic Greek period was from the 5<sup>th<\/sup> to the 2<sup>nd<\/sup> century BC and then most everything was built over by the Romans, Christian, Byzantines and the Ottomans. Their main value lies not on the remaining structures but on the history presented. Most of the really good stuff is in museums in London, Berlin and Athens. The low quality things are in the local museums. The invaders and the local townspeople plundered most of the stone for building material. There are much better Greek archaeologic sites in Sicily and Italy.<br \/>\n<strong>3. Museums.<\/strong> Greek museums have unusual hours \u2013 usually 8:30 to 4 and tend to be closed on Tuesdays. The archaeological WHS sites are expensive at \u20ac12. I use my British Columbia Driver\u2019s license for ID and say I am from England and get the half price reduced ticket generally available only to citizens over 65 of the EU. It works most every time. But I have also been to some of the best museums in the world: the archaeological museums in Crete, Delphi and Aigai are world class.<br \/>\n<strong>4. Alphabet. <\/strong>Most road signs, businesses and menus are in Greek \u2013 and it is completely indecipherable, especially as the Greek names are different from the English translations. It\u2019s all Greek to me.<br \/>\n<strong>5. Driving.<\/strong> Greece has an odd mix of very slow old men drivers (and there are a lot of old men \u2013 it must be the Mediterranean diet) and young speed freaks. The expressways have a top speed limit of 130 but a confusing number of speed reductions. Speeds are unlimited on them. The secondary roads tend to have wide shoulders, speed limits of 90 and Greek drivers have the wonderful habit of driving on the shoulders to let you pass. All roads have a dizzying number of signs \u201cPolice Controlled Speeds\u201d but absolutely no one pays any attention to them. They all use their phone when driving and cut corners (this can be very scary). But they don\u2019t tail gate nearly as much as in Italy and the Balkans (this really bugs me when they are 2 metres behind you at 120kms per hour).<br \/>\nThese are the only toll booths that are manned with no tickets. To pay with a credit card (otherwise bring a lot of change), you have to deal with a real human.<br \/>\nGreece has more stoplights than is usual in the rest of Europe. But they are so poorly designed and timed, that I have never spent so much time waiting at lights with no traffic moving.<br \/>\nMotorcyclists (that are relatively uncommon) don\u2019t wear helmets. Bicycles are also uncommon. Double parking is rampant.<br \/>\n<strong>6. Food.<\/strong> Menus are a mix of Greek food, a lot of Italian and hamburgers. Club sandwiches are big. The Main Street Diner in Nelson, British Columbia has a better Greek menu.<br \/>\n<strong>7. Garbage.<\/strong> Greece has a garbage problem. Dumpsters are overflowing and garbage lines the highways.<br \/>\n<strong>8. Services<\/strong> are uncommon. Finding a shower is near impossible. In the rest of Europe large service centres on major highways have showers primarily to service the truckers. None have showers in Greece. Almost all campgrounds were closed at this time of year and most campgrounds are full of permanent trailers.<br \/>\nMcDonalds are rare (only in Athens and Thessaloniki) and I am wifi challenged. Fortunately Greece has Lidl grocery stores that are the cheapest source of food.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Greece\u00a0officially the\u00a0Hellenic Republic<\/strong>, self-identified and historically known as\u00a0Hellas, is a country located in\u00a0Southern\u00a0and\u00a0Southeast Europe, with a population of approximately 11 million as of 2016.\u00a0Athens\u00a0is the nation&#8217;s capital and largest city, followed by\u00a0Thessaloniki.<br \/>\nGreece is located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Situated on the southern tip of the\u00a0Balkan Peninsula, it shares land borders with\u00a0Albania\u00a0to the northwest,\u00a0North Macedonia\u00a0and\u00a0Bulgaria\u00a0to the north, and\u00a0Turkey\u00a0to the northeast. The\u00a0Aegean Sea\u00a0lies to the east of the\u00a0mainland, the\u00a0Ionian Sea\u00a0to the west, the\u00a0Cretan Sea\u00a0and the\u00a0Mediterranean Sea\u00a0to the south. Greece has the longest coastline on the\u00a0Mediterranean Basin\u00a0and the\u00a011th longest coastline in the world\u00a0at 13,676\u00a0km (8,498\u00a0mi) in length, featuring a large number of\u00a0islands, of which 227 are inhabited. Eighty percent of Greece is mountainous, with\u00a0Mount Olympus\u00a0being the highest peak at 2,918 metres (9,573\u00a0ft). The country consists of nine\u00a0geographic regions:\u00a0Macedonia,\u00a0Central Greece, the\u00a0Peloponnese,\u00a0Thessaly,\u00a0Epirus, the\u00a0Aegean Islands\u00a0(including the\u00a0Dodecanese\u00a0and\u00a0Cyclades),\u00a0Thrace,\u00a0Crete, and the\u00a0Ionian Islands.<\/p>\n<p>Greece is considered the cradle of\u00a0Western civilisation, being the birthplace of\u00a0democracy,\u00a0Western philosophy,\u00a0Western literature,\u00a0historiography,\u00a0political science, major\u00a0scientific\u00a0and\u00a0mathematical\u00a0principles,\u00a0Western drama\u00a0and notably the\u00a0Olympic Games. From the eighth century BC, the Greeks were organised into various independent city-states, known as\u00a0poleis\u00a0(singular\u00a0polis), which spanned the entire\u00a0Mediterranean region\u00a0and the\u00a0Black Sea.\u00a0Philip of Macedon\u00a0united most of the Greek mainland in the fourth century BC, with his son\u00a0Alexander the Great\u00a0rapidly conquering much of the ancient world, from the eastern Mediterranean to\u00a0India. Greece was\u00a0annexed\u00a0by\u00a0Rome\u00a0in the second century BC, becoming an integral part of the\u00a0Roman Empire\u00a0and its successor, the\u00a0Byzantine Empire, in which Greek language and culture were dominant. Rooted in the first century A.D., the\u00a0Greek Orthodox Church helped shape modern Greek identity and transmitted Greek traditions to the wider\u00a0Orthodox World. Falling under\u00a0Ottoman dominion in the mid-15th century, the modern\u00a0nation state\u00a0of Greece emerged in 1830 following a\u00a0war of independence. Greece&#8217;s rich historical legacy is reflected by its 18\u00a0UNESCO World Heritage Sites.<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0sovereign state\u00a0of Greece is a\u00a0unitary parliamentary republic\u00a0and\u00a0developed country\u00a0with an advanced\u00a0high-income economy, a high\u00a0quality of life, and a very high\u00a0standard of living. A founding member of the\u00a0United Nations, Greece was the tenth member to join the\u00a0European Communities\u00a0(precursor to the\u00a0European Union) and has been part of the\u00a0Eurozone\u00a0since 2001. It is also a member of numerous other international institutions, including the\u00a0Council of Europe, the\u00a0North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u00a0(NATO), the\u00a0Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u00a0(OECD), the\u00a0World Trade Organization\u00a0(WTO), the\u00a0Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe\u00a0(OSCE), and the\u00a0Organisation internationale de la Francophonie\u00a0(OIF). Greece&#8217;s unique cultural heritage, large\u00a0tourism industry,\u00a0prominent shipping sector\u00a0and\u00a0geostrategic importance\u00a0classify it as a\u00a0middle power. It is the\u00a0largest economy\u00a0in the\u00a0Balkans, where it is an important regional investor.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Etymology<br \/>\n<\/strong>The names for the nation of Greece and\u00a0the Greek people\u00a0differ from the names used in other languages, locations and cultures. The Greek name of the country is\u00a0Hellas or\u00a0Ellada. Ell\u00e1da and its official name is the Hellenic Republic. In\u00a0English, however, the country is usually called Greece, which comes from\u00a0Latin\u00a0Graecia\u00a0(as used by the\u00a0Romans) and literally means &#8216;the land of the Greeks&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HISTORY<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Prehistory and early history. <\/strong>The earliest evidence of the presence of human ancestors in the southern\u00a0Balkans, dated to 270,000 BC, is to be found in the\u00a0Petralona cave, in the Greek province of\u00a0Macedonia.\u00a0All three stages of the stone age (Paleolithic,\u00a0Mesolithic, and\u00a0Neolithic) are represented in Greece, for example in the\u00a0Franchthi Cave.\u00a0Neolithic\u00a0settlements in Greece, dating from the 7th millennium BC,\u00a0are the oldest in Europe by several centuries, as Greece lies on the route via which farming spread from the\u00a0Near East\u00a0to Europe.<br \/>\nGreece is home to the first advanced civilizations in Europe and is considered the birthplace of Western civilisation,\u00a0beginning with the\u00a0Cycladic civilization\u00a0on the islands of the\u00a0Aegean Sea\u00a0at around 3200 BC,\u00a0the\u00a0Minoan civilization\u00a0in Crete (2700\u20131500 BC),\u00a0and then the\u00a0Mycenaean civilization on the mainland (1900\u20131100 BC).\u00a0These civilizations possessed writing, the Minoans writing in an undeciphered script known as\u00a0Linear A, and the Mycenaeans in\u00a0Linear B, an early form of\u00a0Greek. The Mycenaeans gradually absorbed the Minoans, but collapsed violently around 1200 BC, during a time of regional upheaval known as the\u00a0Bronze Age collapse. This ushered in a period known as the\u00a0Greek Dark Ages, from which written records are absent. Though the unearthed Linear B texts are too fragmentary for the reconstruction of the political landscape and can&#8217;t support the existence of a larger state contemporary Hittite and Egyptian records suggest the presence of a single state under a &#8220;Great King&#8221; based in mainland Greece.<br \/>\n<strong>Archaic and Classical period.\u00a0<\/strong>The end of the Dark Ages is traditionally dated to 776 BC, the year of the first\u00a0Olympic Games.\u00a0The\u00a0Iliad\u00a0and the\u00a0Odyssey, the foundational texts of\u00a0Western literature, are believed to have been composed by\u00a0Homer\u00a0in the 7th or 8th centuries BC.\u00a0With the end of the Dark Ages, there emerged various kingdoms and\u00a0city-states\u00a0across the Greek peninsula, which spread to the shores of the\u00a0Black Sea,\u00a0Southern Italy\u00a0(&#8220;Magna Graecia&#8221;) and\u00a0Asia Minor. These states and their colonies reached great levels of\u00a0prosperity\u00a0that resulted in an unprecedented cultural boom, that of\u00a0classical Greece, expressed in\u00a0architecture,\u00a0drama,\u00a0science,\u00a0mathematics\u00a0and\u00a0philosophy. In 508 BC,\u00a0Cleisthenes\u00a0instituted the world&#8217;s first\u00a0democratic\u00a0system of government in\u00a0Athens.<br \/>\nBy 500 BC, the\u00a0Persian Empire\u00a0controlled the Greek city states in Asia Minor and\u00a0Macedonia.\u00a0Attempts by some of the Greek city-states of Asia Minor to overthrow Persian rule\u00a0failed, and Persia\u00a0invaded the states of mainland Greece\u00a0in 492 BC, but was forced to withdraw after a defeat at the\u00a0Battle of Marathon\u00a0in 490 BC. In response, the Greek city-states formed the Hellenic League in 481 BC, led by Sparta, which was the first historically recorded union of Greek States since the mythical union of the Trojan War.\u00a0A\u00a0second invasion\u00a0by the Persians followed in 480 BC. Following decisive Greek victories in 480 and 479 BC at\u00a0Salamis,\u00a0Plataea, and\u00a0Mycale, the Persians were forced to withdraw for a second time, marking their eventual withdrawal from all of their European territories. Led by Athens and Sparta, the Greek victories in the\u00a0Greco-Persian Wars\u00a0are considered a pivotal moment in world history,\u00a0as the 50 years of peace that followed are known as the\u00a0Golden Age of Athens, the seminal period of ancient Greek development that laid many of the foundations of Western civilization.<br \/>\nLack of political unity within Greece resulted in frequent conflict between Greek states. The most devastating intra-Greek war was the\u00a0Peloponnesian War\u00a0(431\u2013404 BC), won by\u00a0Sparta\u00a0and marking the demise of the\u00a0Athenian Empire\u00a0as the leading power in ancient Greece. Both Athens and Sparta were later overshadowed by\u00a0Thebes\u00a0and eventually\u00a0Macedon, with the latter uniting most of the city-states of the Greek hinterland in the\u00a0League of Corinth\u00a0(also known as the\u00a0Hellenic League\u00a0or\u00a0Greek League) under the control of\u00a0Phillip II.\u00a0Despite this development, the Greek world remained largely fragmented and would not be united under a single power until the Roman years.\u00a0Sparta did not join the League and actively fought against it, raising an army led by\u00a0Agis III\u00a0to secure the city-states of\u00a0Crete\u00a0for Persia.<br \/>\nFollowing the assassination of Phillip II, his son\u00a0Alexander III\u00a0(&#8220;The Great&#8221;) assumed the leadership of the League of Corinth and launched an invasion of the Persian Empire with the combined forces of the League in 334 BC. Undefeated in battle, Alexander had conquered the Persian Empire in its entirety by 330 BC. By the time of his death in 323 BC, he had created one of the largest empires in history, stretching from Greece to India. His empire split into several kingdoms upon his death, the most famous of which were the\u00a0Seleucid Empire,\u00a0Ptolemaic Egypt, the\u00a0Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, and the\u00a0Indo-Greek Kingdom. Many Greeks migrated to\u00a0Alexandria,\u00a0Antioch,\u00a0Seleucia, and the many other new Hellenistic cities in\u00a0Asia\u00a0and\u00a0Africa. Although the political unity of Alexander&#8217;s empire could not be maintained, it resulted in the\u00a0Hellenistic civilization\u00a0and spread the Greek language and Greek culture in the territories conquered by Alexander.\u00a0Greek science, technology, and mathematics are generally considered to have reached their peak during the Hellenistic period.<br \/>\n<strong>Hellenistic and Roman periods (323 BC \u2013 4th century AD).\u00a0<\/strong>After a\u00a0period of confusion\u00a0following Alexander&#8217;s death, the\u00a0Antigonid dynasty, descended from one of Alexander&#8217;s generals, established its control over Macedon and most of the Greek city-states by 276 BC.\u00a0From about 200 BC the\u00a0Roman Republic\u00a0became increasingly involved in Greek affairs and engaged in a\u00a0series of wars with Macedon.\u00a0Macedon&#8217;s defeat at the\u00a0Battle of Pydna\u00a0in 168 BC signalled the end of Antigonid power in Greece.\u00a0In 146 BC, Macedonia was annexed as a province by Rome, and the rest of Greece became a Roman protectorate.<br \/>\nThe process was completed in 27 BC when the Roman Emperor\u00a0Augustus\u00a0annexed the rest of Greece and constituted it as the\u00a0senatorial province\u00a0of\u00a0Achaea.\u00a0Despite their military superiority, the Romans admired and became\u00a0heavily influenced\u00a0by the achievements of Greek culture, hence\u00a0Horace&#8217;s famous statement:\u00a0Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit\u00a0(&#8220;Greece, although captured, took its wild conqueror captive&#8221;).\u00a0The epics of\u00a0Homer\u00a0inspired the\u00a0Aeneid\u00a0of\u00a0Virgil, and authors such as\u00a0Seneca the younger\u00a0wrote using Greek styles. Roman heroes such as\u00a0Scipio Africanus, tended to study\u00a0philosophy\u00a0and regarded Greek culture and science as an example to be followed. Similarly, most Roman emperors maintained an admiration for things Greek in nature. The\u00a0Roman Emperor\u00a0Nero\u00a0visited Greece in AD 66, and performed at the\u00a0Ancient Olympic Games, despite the rules against non-Greek participation.\u00a0Hadrian\u00a0was also particularly fond of the Greeks. Before becoming emperor, he served as an\u00a0eponymous archon\u00a0of Athens.<br \/>\nGreek-speaking communities of the Hellenised East were instrumental in the spread of early Christianity in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, and Christianity&#8217;s early leaders and writers (notably\u00a0St Paul) were mostly Greek-speaking, though generally not from Greece itself. The\u00a0New Testament\u00a0was written in Greek, and some of its sections (Corinthians,\u00a0Thessalonians,\u00a0Philippians,\u00a0Revelation\u00a0of St. John of\u00a0Patmos) attest to the importance of churches in Greece in\u00a0early Christianity. Nevertheless, much of Greece clung tenaciously to paganism, and ancient Greek religious practices were still in vogue in the late 4th century AD,\u00a0when they were outlawed by the Roman emperor\u00a0Theodosius I\u00a0in 391\u2013392.<br \/>\nThe last recorded Olympic games were held in 393,\u00a0and many temples were destroyed or damaged in the century that followed.\u00a0In Athens and rural areas, paganism is attested well into the sixth century AD\u00a0and even later.\u00a0The closure of the\u00a0Neoplatonic\u00a0Academy of Athens by the Emperor Justinian in 529 is considered by many to mark the end of antiquity, although there is evidence that the Academy continued its activities for some time after that.\u00a0Some remote areas such as the southeastern Peloponnese remained pagan until well into the 10th century AD.<br \/>\n<strong>Medieval period (4th \u2013 15th century).\u00a0<\/strong>The Roman Empire in the east, following the\u00a0fall of the Empire in the west\u00a0in the 5th century, is conventionally known as the Byzantine Empire (but was simply called &#8220;Roman Empire&#8221; in its own time) and lasted until 1453. With its capital in\u00a0Constantinople, its language and literary culture was Greek and its religion was predominantly\u00a0Eastern Orthodox Christian.<br \/>\nFrom the 4th century, the Empire&#8217;s Balkan territories, including Greece, suffered from the dislocation of\u00a0barbarian invasions. The raids and devastation of the\u00a0Goths\u00a0and\u00a0Huns\u00a0in the 4th and 5th centuries and the\u00a0Slavic\u00a0invasion of Greece in the 7th century resulted in a dramatic collapse in imperial authority in the Greek peninsula.\u00a0Following the Slavic invasion, the imperial government retained formal control of only the islands and coastal areas, particularly the densely populated walled cities such as Athens, Corinth and Thessalonica, while some mountainous areas in the interior held out on their own and continued to recognize imperial authority.\u00a0Outside of these areas, a limited amount of Slavic settlement is generally thought to have occurred, although on a much smaller scale than previously thought.\u00a0However, the view that Greece in late antiquity underwent a crisis of decline, fragmentation and depopulation is now considered outdated, as Greek cities show a high degree of institutional continuity and prosperity between the 4th and 6th centuries AD (and possibly later as well). In the early 6th century, Greece had approximately 80 cities according to the\u00a0Synecdemus\u00a0chronicle, and the period from the 4th to the 7th century AD is considered one of high prosperity not just in Greece but in the entire Eastern Mediterranean.<br \/>\nUntil the 8th century almost all of modern Greece was under the jurisdiction of the\u00a0Holy See\u00a0of\u00a0Rome\u00a0according to the system of\u00a0Pentarchy. Byzantine\u00a0Emperor Leo III\u00a0moved the border of the\u00a0Patriarchate of Constantinople\u00a0westward and northward in the 8th century.<br \/>\nThe Byzantine recovery of lost provinces began toward the end of the 8th century and most of the Greek peninsula came under imperial control again, in stages, during the 9th century.\u00a0This process was facilitated by a large influx of Greeks from Sicily and Asia Minor to the Greek peninsula, while at the same time many Slavs were captured and re-settled in Asia Minor and the few that remained were assimilated.\u00a0During the 11th and 12th centuries the return of stability resulted in the Greek peninsula benefiting from strong economic growth\u00a0\u2013 much stronger than that of the Anatolian territories of the Empire.\u00a0During that time, the\u00a0Greek Orthodox Church\u00a0was also instrumental in the spread of Greek ideas to the wider\u00a0Orthodox world.<br \/>\nFollowing the\u00a0Fourth Crusade\u00a0and the fall of Constantinople to the &#8220;Latins&#8221; in 1204 mainland Greece was split between the Greek\u00a0Despotate of Epirus\u00a0(a Byzantine successor state) and\u00a0French\u00a0rule\u00a0(known as the\u00a0Frankokratia), while some islands came under\u00a0Venetian\u00a0rule.\u00a0The re-establishment of the Byzantine imperial capital in Constantinople in 1261 was accompanied by the empire&#8217;s recovery of much of the Greek peninsula, although the Frankish\u00a0Principality of Achaea\u00a0in the Peloponnese and the rival Greek\u00a0Despotate of Epirus\u00a0in the north both remained important regional powers into the 14th century, while the islands remained largely under Genoese and Venetian control.\u00a0During the\u00a0Paleologi dynasty\u00a0(1261\u20131453) a new era of Greek patriotism emerged accompanied by a turning back to\u00a0ancient Greece.<br \/>\nAs such prominent personalities at the time also proposed changing the imperial title to &#8220;Emperor of the\u00a0Hellenes&#8221;,\u00a0and, in late fourteenth century, the emperor was frequently referred to as the &#8220;Emperor of the Hellenes&#8221;.\u00a0Similarly, in several international treaties of that time the Byzantine emperor is styled as &#8220;Imperator Graecorum&#8221;.<br \/>\nIn the 14th century, much of the Greek peninsula was lost by the Byzantine Empire at first to the\u00a0Serbs\u00a0and then to the\u00a0Ottomans.\u00a0By the beginning of the 15th century, the Ottoman advance meant that Byzantine territory in Greece was limited mainly to its then-largest city, Thessaloniki, and the Peloponnese (Despotate of the Morea).\u00a0After the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453, the Morea was one of the last remnants of the Byzantine Empire to hold out against the Ottomans. However, this, too, fell to the Ottomans in 1460, completing the Ottoman conquest of mainland Greece.\u00a0With the Turkish conquest, many Byzantine Greek scholars, who up until then were largely responsible for preserving\u00a0Classical Greek\u00a0knowledge, fled to the West, taking with them a large body of literature and thereby significantly\u00a0contributing to the Renaissance.<br \/>\n<strong>Venetian possessions and Ottoman rule (15th century \u2013 1821).\u00a0<\/strong>The\u00a0Byzantine\u00a0castle of\u00a0Angelokastro\u00a0successfully repulsed the\u00a0Ottomans\u00a0during the\u00a0First Great Siege of Corfu in 1537, the siege of 1571, and the\u00a0Second Great Siege of Corfu in 1716, causing them to abandon their plans to conquer\u00a0Corfu.<br \/>\nWhile most of mainland Greece and the Aegean islands was under Ottoman control by the end of the 15th century,\u00a0Cyprus\u00a0and\u00a0Crete remained\u00a0Venetian\u00a0territory and did not fall to the Ottomans until 1571 and 1670 respectively. The only part of the Greek-speaking world that escaped long-term Ottoman rule was the\u00a0Ionian Islands, which remained Venetian until their capture by the\u00a0First French Republic\u00a0in 1797, then passed to the\u00a0United Kingdom\u00a0in 1809 until their unification with Greece in 1864.<br \/>\nWhile some Greeks in the Ionian Islands and\u00a0Constantinople\u00a0lived in prosperity, and Greeks of Constantinople (Phanariotes) achieved positions of power within the Ottoman administration,\u00a0much of the population of mainland Greece suffered the economic consequences of the Ottoman conquest. Heavy taxes were enforced, and in later years the Ottoman Empire enacted a policy of creation of hereditary estates, effectively turning the rural Greek populations into\u00a0serfs.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Greek Orthodox Church\u00a0and the\u00a0Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople\u00a0were considered by the Ottoman governments as the ruling authorities of the entire\u00a0Orthodox Christian\u00a0population of the Ottoman Empire, whether ethnically Greek or not. Although the Ottoman state did not force non-Muslims to convert to\u00a0Islam, Christians faced several types of discrimination intended to highlight their inferior status in the Ottoman Empire. Discrimination against Christians, particularly when combined with harsh treatment by local Ottoman authorities, led to conversions to Islam, if only superficially. In the 19th century, many &#8220;crypto-Christians&#8221; returned to their old religious allegiance.<br \/>\nThe nature of Ottoman administration of Greece varied, though it was invariably arbitrary and often harsh.\u00a0Some cities had governors appointed by the\u00a0Sultan, while others (like Athens) were self-governed municipalities. Mountainous regions in the interior and many islands remained effectively autonomous from the central Ottoman state for many centuries.<br \/>\nWhen military conflicts broke out between the Ottoman Empire and other states, Greeks usually took up arms against the Ottomans, with few exceptions. Prior to the Greek Revolution of 1821, there had been a number of wars which saw Greeks fight against the Ottomans, such as the Greek participation in the\u00a0Battle of Lepanto\u00a0in 1571, the Epirus peasants&#8217; revolts of 1600\u20131601 (led by the Orthodox bishop\u00a0Dionysios Skylosophos), the\u00a0Morean War\u00a0of 1684\u20131699, and the\u00a0Russian-instigated\u00a0Orlov Revolt\u00a0in 1770, which aimed at breaking up the Ottoman Empire in favor of Russian interests. These uprisings were put down by the Ottomans with great bloodshed.\u00a0On the other side, many Greeks were conscripted as Ottoman citizens to serve in the Ottoman army (and especially the Ottoman navy), while also the\u00a0Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, responsible for the Orthodox, remained in general loyal to the empire.<br \/>\nThe 16th and 17th centuries are regarded as something of a &#8220;dark age&#8221; in Greek history, with the prospect of overthrowing Ottoman rule appearing remote with only the Ionian islands remaining free of Turkish domination.\u00a0Corfu\u00a0withstood three major sieges in\u00a01537, 1571 and\u00a01716\u00a0all of which resulted in the repulsion of the Ottomans. However, in the 18th century, due to their mastery of shipping and commerce, a wealthy and dispersed Greek merchant class arose. These merchants came to dominate trade within the Ottoman Empire, establishing communities throughout the Mediterranean, the Balkans, and Western Europe. Though the Ottoman conquest had cut Greece off from significant European intellectual movements such as the\u00a0Reformation\u00a0and the\u00a0Enlightenment, these ideas together with the ideals of the\u00a0French Revolution\u00a0and\u00a0romantic nationalism\u00a0began to penetrate the Greek world via the mercantile diaspora.\u00a0In the late 18th century,\u00a0Rigas Feraios, the first revolutionary to envision an independent Greek state, published a series of documents relating to Greek independence, including but not limited to a national anthem and the first detailed map of Greece, in\u00a0Vienna, and was murdered by Ottoman agents in 1798.<br \/>\n<strong>Modern period<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Greek War of Independence (1821\u20131832).\u00a0<\/strong>The\u00a0Battle of Navarino\u00a0in 1827 secured Greek independence.\u00a0In the late eighteenth century, an increase in secular learning during the\u00a0Modern Greek Enlightenment\u00a0led to the revival among Greeks of the diaspora of the\u00a0notion of a Greek nation\u00a0tracing its existence to\u00a0ancient Greece, distinct from the other Orthodox peoples, and having a right to political autonomy. One of the organizations formed in this intellectual milieu was the\u00a0Filiki Eteria, a secret organization formed by merchants in\u00a0Odessa\u00a0in 1814.\u00a0Appropriating a long-standing tradition of\u00a0Orthodox\u00a0messianic prophecy aspiring to the resurrection of the\u00a0eastern Roman empire\u00a0and creating the impression they had the backing of\u00a0Tsarist Russia, they managed amidst a crisis of Ottoman trade, from 1815 onwards, to engage traditional strata of the Greek Orthodox world in their liberal nationalist cause.\u00a0The Filiki Eteria planned to launch revolution in the\u00a0Peloponnese, the\u00a0Danubian Principalities\u00a0and\u00a0Constantinople. The first of these revolts began on 6 March 1821 in the Danubian Principalities under the leadership of\u00a0Alexandros Ypsilantis, but it was soon put down by the Ottomans. The events in the north spurred the Greeks of the Peloponnese into action and on 17 March 1821 the\u00a0Maniots\u00a0declared war on the Ottomans.<br \/>\nBy the end of the month, the Peloponnese was in open revolt against the Ottomans and by October 1821 the Greeks under\u00a0Theodoros Kolokotronis\u00a0had captured\u00a0Tripolitsa. The Peloponnesian revolt was quickly followed by revolts in\u00a0Crete,\u00a0Macedonia\u00a0and\u00a0Central Greece, which would soon be suppressed. Meanwhile, the makeshift Greek navy was achieving success against the Ottoman navy in the\u00a0Aegean Sea\u00a0and prevented Ottoman reinforcements from arriving by sea. In 1822 and 1824 the Turks and Egyptians ravaged the islands, including\u00a0Chios\u00a0and\u00a0Psara, committing wholesale\u00a0massacres\u00a0of the population.\u00a0Approximately three-quarters of the\u00a0Chios&#8217; Greek population of 120,000 were\u00a0killed, enslaved\u00a0or died of disease.\u00a0This had the effect of galvanizing public opinion in western Europe in favor of the Greek rebels.<br \/>\nTensions soon developed among different Greek factions, leading to two consecutive civil wars. Meanwhile, the\u00a0Ottoman Sultan\u00a0negotiated with\u00a0Mehmet Ali of Egypt, who agreed to send his son\u00a0Ibrahim Pasha\u00a0to Greece with an army to suppress the revolt in return for territorial gain. Ibrahim landed in the Peloponnese in February 1825 and had immediate success: by the end of 1825, most of the Peloponnese was under Egyptian control, and the city of\u00a0Missolonghi\u2014put under siege by the Turks since April 1825\u2014fell in April 1826. Although Ibrahim was defeated in\u00a0Mani, he had succeeded in suppressing most of the revolt in the Peloponnese and Athens had been retaken.<br \/>\nAfter years of negotiation, three\u00a0great powers,\u00a0France,\u00a0Russian Empire, and the\u00a0United Kingdom, decided to intervene in the conflict and each nation sent a navy to Greece. Following news that combined Ottoman\u2013Egyptian fleets were going to attack the Greek island of\u00a0Hydra, the allied fleet intercepted the Ottoman\u2013Egyptian fleet at\u00a0Navarino. A week-long standoff ended with the\u00a0Battle of Navarino\u00a0which resulted in the destruction of the Ottoman\u2013Egyptian fleet. A\u00a0French expeditionary force\u00a0was dispatched to supervise the evacuation of the Egyptian army from the Peloponnese, while the Greeks proceeded to the captured part of Central Greece by 1828. As a result of years of negotiation, the\u00a0nascent Greek state\u00a0was finally recognised under the\u00a0London Protocol\u00a0in 1830.<br \/>\n<strong>Kingdom of Greece.\u00a0<\/strong>In 1827,\u00a0Ioannis Kapodistrias, from\u00a0Corfu, was chosen by the\u00a0Third National Assembly at Troezen\u00a0as the first governor of the\u00a0First Hellenic Republic. Kapodistrias established a series of state, economic and military institutions. Soon tensions appeared between him and local interests. Following his assassination in 1831 and the subsequent\u00a0London conference\u00a0a year later, the\u00a0Great Powers of Britain, France and Russia installed Bavarian Prince\u00a0Otto von Wittelsbach\u00a0as\u00a0monarch.\u00a0Otto&#8217;s reign was\u00a0despotic, and in its first 11 years of independence Greece was ruled by a Bavarian oligarchy led by\u00a0Joseph Ludwig von Armansperg\u00a0as\u00a0Prime Minister and, later, by Otto himself, who held the title of both King and Premier.\u00a0Throughout this period Greece remained under the influence of its three protecting\u00a0Great Powers,\u00a0France,\u00a0Russia, and the\u00a0United Kingdom, as well as\u00a0Bavaria.\u00a0In 1843 an uprising forced the king to grant a constitution and a representative assembly.<br \/>\nDespite the\u00a0absolutism\u00a0of Otto&#8217;s reign, the early years proved instrumental in creating institutions that are still the bedrock of Greek administration and education.\u00a0Important steps were taken in the creation of the education system, maritime and postal communications, effective civil administration and, most importantly, the\u00a0legal code.\u00a0Historical revisionism\u00a0took the form of de-Byzantinification\u00a0and de-Ottomanisation, in favour of promoting the country&#8217;s\u00a0Ancient Greek\u00a0heritage.\u00a0In this spirit, the national capital was moved from\u00a0Nafplio, where it had been since 1829, to\u00a0Athens, which was at the time a village.\u00a0Religious reform also took place, and the\u00a0Church of Greece\u00a0was established as Greece&#8217;s\u00a0national church, although Otto remained a\u00a0Catholic. 25 March, the day of\u00a0Annunciation, was chosen as the anniversary of the\u00a0Greek War of Independence\u00a0in order to reinforce the link between Greek identity and\u00a0Orthodoxy.\u00a0Pavlos Karolidis\u00a0called the Bavarian efforts to create a modern state in Greece as &#8220;not only appropriate for the peoples&#8217; needs, but also based on excellent administrative principles of the era&#8221;.<br \/>\nOtto was deposed in the\u00a023 October 1862 Revolution. Multiple causes led to his deposition and exile, including the Bavarian-dominated government, heavy taxation, and a failed attempt to annex\u00a0Crete\u00a0from the\u00a0Ottoman Empire.\u00a0The catalyst for the revolt was Otto&#8217;s dismissal of\u00a0Konstantinos Kanaris\u00a0from the Premiership.\u00a0A year later, he was replaced by Prince Wilhelm (William) of Denmark, who took the name\u00a0George I\u00a0and brought with him the Ionian Islands as a coronation gift from Britain. A\u00a0new Constitution in 1864\u00a0changed Greece&#8217;s form of government from\u00a0constitutional monarchy\u00a0to the more democratic\u00a0crowned republic.\u00a0In 1875 the concept of\u00a0parliamentary majority\u00a0as a requirement for the formation of a government was introduced by\u00a0Charilaos Trikoupis,\u00a0curbing the power of the monarchy to appoint\u00a0minority governments\u00a0of its preference.<br \/>\nCorruption, coupled with Trikoupis&#8217; increased spending to fund infrastructure projectslike the\u00a0Corinth Canal, overtaxed the weak Greek economy and forced the declaration of\u00a0public insolvency\u00a0in 1893. Greece also accepted the imposition of an International Financial Control authority to pay off the country&#8217;s debtors. Another political issue in 19th-century Greece was uniquely Greek: the language question. The Greek people spoke a form of Greek called\u00a0Demotic. Many of the educated elite saw this as a peasant dialect and were determined to restore the glories of\u00a0Ancient Greek.<br \/>\nGovernment documents and newspapers were consequently published in\u00a0Katharevousa\u00a0(purified) Greek, a form which few ordinary Greeks could read. Liberals favoured recognising Demotic as the national language, but conservatives and the Orthodox Church resisted all such efforts, to the extent that, when the\u00a0New Testament\u00a0was translated into Demotic in 1901, riots erupted in Athens and the government fell (the\u00a0Evangeliaka). This issue would continue to plague Greek politics until the 1970s.<br \/>\nAll Greeks were united, however, in their determination to liberate the\u00a0Hellenic lands\u00a0under Ottoman rule. Especially in\u00a0Crete, a\u00a0prolonged revolt in 1866\u20131869\u00a0had raised nationalist fervour. When war broke out between\u00a0Russia and the Ottomans in 1877, Greek popular sentiment rallied to Russia&#8217;s side, but Greece was too poor, and too concerned about British intervention, to officially enter the war. Nevertheless, in 1881,\u00a0Thessaly\u00a0and small parts of\u00a0Epirus\u00a0were ceded to Greece as part of the\u00a0Treaty of Berlin, while frustrating Greek hopes of receiving Crete.<br \/>\nGreeks in Crete continued to stage regular revolts, and in 1897, the Greek government under Theodoros Deligiannis, bowing to popular pressure, declared war on the Ottomans. In the ensuing\u00a0Greco-Turkish War of 1897, the badly trained and equipped Greek army was defeated by the Ottomans. Through the intervention of the Great Powers, however, Greece lost only a little territory along the border to Turkey, while Crete was established as an\u00a0autonomous state\u00a0under\u00a0Prince George of Greece. With state coffers empty, fiscal policy came under\u00a0International Financial Control.\u00a0Alarmed by the abortive\u00a0Ilinden uprising\u00a0of the\u00a0autonomist\u00a0IMRO\u00a0in 1903, the Greek government, aiming to quell\u00a0IMRO bands\u00a0and detach the\u00a0Slavophone peasants of the region\u00a0from\u00a0Bulgarian\u00a0influence, sponsored a\u00a0guerilla\u00a0campaign in Ottoman-ruled\u00a0Macedonia, led by Greek officers and known as the\u00a0Macedonian Struggle, which ended with the\u00a0Young Turk Revolution\u00a0in 1908.<br \/>\n<strong>Expansion, disaster, and reconstruction.\u00a0<\/strong>Amidst general dissatisfaction with the seeming inertia and unattainability of\u00a0national aspirations\u00a0under the premiership of the cautious reformist\u00a0Theotokis, a group of military officers organised a\u00a0coup\u00a0in August 1909 and shortly thereafter called to Athens\u00a0Cretan\u00a0politician\u00a0Eleftherios Venizelos, who conveyed a vision of national regeneration. After winning\u00a0two\u00a0elections\u00a0and becoming Prime Minister in 1910, Venizelos initiated wide-ranging fiscal, social, and\u00a0constitutional reforms, reorganised the military, made Greece a member of the\u00a0Balkan League, and led the country through the\u00a0Balkan Wars. By 1913, Greece&#8217;s territory and population had almost doubled, annexing\u00a0Crete,\u00a0Epirus, and\u00a0Macedonia. In the following years, the struggle between\u00a0King Constantine I\u00a0and charismatic Venizelos over the country&#8217;s foreign policy on the eve of\u00a0First World War\u00a0dominated the country&#8217;s political scene, and divided the country into\u00a0two opposing groups. During parts of the WW1, Greece had two governments: A royalist\u00a0pro-German\u00a0one in\u00a0Athens\u00a0and a\u00a0Venizelist\u00a0pro-Entente\u00a0one in\u00a0Thessaloniki. The two governments were united in 1917, when Greece officially entered the war on the side of the Entente.<br \/>\nIn the aftermath of World War I, Greece attempted further expansion into\u00a0Asia Minor, a region with a large native Greek population at the time, but was defeated in the\u00a0Greco-Turkish War of 1919\u20131922, contributing to a massive flight of\u00a0Asia Minor Greeks.\u00a0These events overlapped, with both happening during the\u00a0Greek genocide (1914\u20131922),\u00a0a period during which, according to various sources,\u00a0Ottoman and Turkish officials contributed to the death of several hundred thousand Asia Minor Greeks, along with similar numbers of\u00a0Assyrians\u00a0and a rather larger number of\u00a0Armenians. The resultant Greek exodus from Asia Minor was made permanent, and expanded, in an official\u00a0Population exchange between Greece and Turkey. The exchange was part of the terms of the\u00a0Treaty of Lausanne\u00a0which ended the war.<br \/>\nThe following era was marked by instability, as over 1.5 million propertyless Greek refugees from Turkey had to be integrated into Greek society.\u00a0Cappadocian Greeks,\u00a0Pontian Greeks, and\u00a0non-Greek followers of Greek Orthodoxy\u00a0were all subject to the exchange as well. Some of the refugees could not speak the language, and were from what had been unfamiliar environments to mainland Greeks, such as in the case of the Cappadocians and non-Greeks. The refugees also made a dramatic post-war population boost, as the number of refugees was more than a quarter of Greece&#8217;s prior population.<br \/>\nFollowing the catastrophic events in Asia Minor, the monarchy was abolished\u00a0via a referendum\u00a0in 1924 and the\u00a0Second Hellenic Republic\u00a0was declared. In 1935, a royalist general-turned-politician\u00a0Georgios Kondylis\u00a0took power after a\u00a0coup d&#8217;\u00e9tat\u00a0and abolished the republic, holding\u00a0a rigged referendum, after which\u00a0King George II\u00a0returned to Greece and was restored to the throne.<br \/>\n<strong>Dictatorship, World War II, and reconstruction.\u00a0<\/strong>An agreement between Prime Minister\u00a0Ioannis Metaxas\u00a0and the head of state\u00a0George II\u00a0followed in 1936, which installed Metaxas as the head of a dictatorial regime known as the\u00a04th of August Regime, inaugurating a period of authoritarian rule that would last, with short breaks, until 1974.\u00a0Although a dictatorship, Greece remained on good terms with Britain and was not allied with the\u00a0Axis.<br \/>\nPostwar Greece would soon experience a\u00a0civil war and political polarization.<br \/>\nOn 28 October 1940,\u00a0Fascist Italy\u00a0demanded the surrender of Greece, but the Greek administration refused, and, in the following\u00a0Greco-Italian War, Greece repelled Italian forces into Albania, giving the\u00a0Allies\u00a0their first victory over Axis forces on land. The Greek struggle and victory against the Italians received exuberant praise at the time.\u00a0Most prominent is the quote attributed to\u00a0Winston Churchill: &#8220;Hence we will not say that Greeks fight like heroes, but we will say that heroes fight like Greeks.&#8221;\u00a0French general\u00a0Charles de Gaulle was among those who praised the fierceness of the Greek resistance. In an official notice released to coincide with the Greek national celebration of the Day of Independence, De Gaulle expressed his admiration for the Greek resistance: \u201cIn the name of the captured yet still alive French people, France wants to send her greetings to the Greek people who are fighting for their freedom.\u201d<br \/>\nThe 25 March 1941 finds Greece in the peak of their heroic struggle and in the top of their glory. Since the Battle of Salamis, Greece had not achieved the greatness and the glory which today holds.<br \/>\nThe country would eventually fall to urgently dispatched\u00a0German\u00a0forces during the\u00a0Battle of Greece, despite the fierce Greek resistance, particularly in the\u00a0Battle of the Metaxas Line.\u00a0Adolf Hitler\u00a0himself recognised the bravery and the courage of the\u00a0Greek army, stating in his address to the Reichstag on 11 December 1941, that: &#8220;Historical justice obliges me to state that of the enemies who took up positions against us, the Greek soldier particularly fought with the highest courage. He capitulated only when further resistance had become impossible and useless.&#8221;<br \/>\nThe Nazis proceeded to administer Athens and Thessaloniki, while other regions of the country were given to Nazi Germany&#8217;s partners, Fascist Italy and Bulgaria. The occupation brought about terrible hardships for the Greek civilian population. Over 100,000 civilians died of starvation during the winter of 1941\u20131942, tens of thousands more died because of reprisals by Nazis and\u00a0collaborators, the country&#8217;s economy was ruined, and the great majority of\u00a0Greek Jews\u00a0were deported and murdered in Nazi concentration camps. The\u00a0Greek Resistance, one of the most effective resistance movements in Europe, fought vehemently against the Nazis and their collaborators. The German occupiers committed\u00a0numerous atrocities, mass executions, and wholesale slaughter of civilians and destruction of towns and villages\u00a0in reprisals. In the course of the concerted anti-guerilla campaign, hundreds of villages were systematically torched and almost 1,000,000 Greeks left homeless.\u00a0In total, the Germans executed some 21,000 Greeks, the Bulgarians 40,000, and the Italians 9,000.<br \/>\nFollowing liberation and the Allied victory over the Axis, Greece annexed the\u00a0Dodecanese Islands\u00a0from Italy and regained\u00a0Western Thrace\u00a0from Bulgaria. The country almost immediately descended into\u00a0a bloody civil war\u00a0between\u00a0communist\u00a0forces and the anti-communist Greek government, which lasted until 1949 with the latter&#8217;s victory. The conflict, considered one of the earliest struggles of the\u00a0Cold War,\u00a0resulted in further economic devastation, mass population displacement and severe political polarisation for the next thirty years.<br \/>\nAlthough the post-war decades were characterised by social strife and widespread marginalisation of the left in political and social spheres, Greece nonetheless experienced\u00a0rapid economic growth\u00a0and recovery, propelled in part by the U.S.-administered\u00a0Marshall Plan.\u00a0In 1952, Greece joined\u00a0NATO, reinforcing its membership in the\u00a0Western Bloc\u00a0of the Cold War.<br \/>\n<strong>Military regime (1967\u201374).\u00a0<\/strong>King\u00a0Constantine II&#8217;s\u00a0dismissal\u00a0of\u00a0George Papandreou&#8217;s centrist government in July 1965 prompted a prolonged period of political turbulence, which culminated in a coup d&#8217;\u00e9tat on 21 April 1967 by the\u00a0Regime of the Colonels. Under the junta, civil rights were suspended, political repression was intensified, and human rights abuses, including state-sanctioned torture, were rampant. Economic growth remained rapid before plateauing in 1972. The brutal suppression of the\u00a0Athens Polytechnic uprising\u00a0on 17 November 1973 set in motion the events that caused the fall of the Papadopoulos regime, resulting in a counter-coup which overthrew\u00a0Georgios Papadopoulos\u00a0and established brigadier\u00a0Dimitrios Ioannidis\u00a0as the new junta strongman. On 20 July 1974,\u00a0Turkey invaded the island of Cyprus\u00a0in response to a Greek-backed Cypriot coup, triggering a political crisis in Greece that led to the regime&#8217;s collapse and the restoration of democracy through\u00a0Metapolitefsi.<br \/>\n<strong>Third Hellenic Republic.\u00a0<\/strong>The former prime minister\u00a0Konstantinos Karamanlis\u00a0was invited back from Paris where he had lived in self-exile since 1963, marking the beginning of the\u00a0Metapolitefsi\u00a0era. The\u00a0first multiparty elections\u00a0since 1964 were held on the first anniversary of the Polytechnic uprising. A democratic and republican\u00a0constitution\u00a0was promulgated on 11 June 1975 following a\u00a0referendum\u00a0which chose to not restore the monarchy.<br \/>\nMeanwhile,\u00a0Andreas Papandreou, George Papandreou&#8217;s son, founded the\u00a0Panhellenic Socialist Movement\u00a0(PASOK) in response to Karamanlis&#8217;s conservative\u00a0New Democracy\u00a0party, with the two political formations dominating in government over the next four decades. Greece rejoined NATO in 1980.\u00a0Greece became the tenth member of the\u00a0European Communities\u00a0(subsequently subsumed by the\u00a0European Union) on 1 January 1981, ushering in a period of sustained growth. Widespread investments in industrial enterprises and heavy infrastructure, as well as funds from the European Union and growing revenues from tourism, shipping, and a fast-growing service sector raised the country&#8217;s standard of living to unprecedented levels. Traditionally strained\u00a0relations with neighbouring Turkey\u00a0improved when successive earthquakes hit both nations in 1999, leading to the lifting of the Greek veto against\u00a0Turkey&#8217;s bi<br \/>\nfor EU membership.<br \/>\nThe country adopted the\u00a0euro\u00a0in 2001 and successfully hosted the\u00a02004 Summer Olympic Games\u00a0in Athens.\u00a0More recently, Greece has suffered greatly from the\u00a0late-2000s recession\u00a0and has been central to the related\u00a0European sovereign debt crisis. Due to the adoption of the euro, when Greece experienced financial crisis, it could no longer\u00a0devalue\u00a0its currency to regain competitiveness.\u00a0Youth unemployment\u00a0was especially high during the 2000s.\u00a0The\u00a0Greek government-debt crisis, and subsequent\u00a0austerity\u00a0policies, have resulted in protests.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GEOGRAPHY<br \/>\n<\/strong>Located in\u00a0Southern Europe,\u00a0Greece is a\u00a0transcontinental country\u00a0that consists of a mountainous, peninsular mainland jutting out into the sea at the southern end of the\u00a0Balkans, ending at the\u00a0Peloponnese peninsula (separated from the mainland by the\u00a0canal\u00a0of the\u00a0Isthmus of Corinth) and strategically located at the crossroads of\u00a0Europe,\u00a0Asia, and\u00a0Africa. Due to its highly indented coastline and numerous islands, Greece has the\u00a011th longest coastline\u00a0in the world with 13,676\u00a0km (8,498\u00a0mi);\u00a0its land boundary is 1,160\u00a0km (721\u00a0mi). The country lies approximately between latitudes\u00a034\u00b0\u00a0and\u00a042\u00b0 N, and longitudes\u00a019\u00b0\u00a0and\u00a030\u00b0 E, with the extreme points being: North:\u00a0Ormenio\u00a0village, South:\u00a0Gavdos\u00a0island, East:\u00a0Strongyli\u00a0(Kastelorizo, Megisti) island, West:\u00a0Othonoi\u00a0island,<br \/>\nEighty percent of Greece consists of mountains or hills, making the country one of the most mountainous in Europe.\u00a0Mount Olympus, the mythical abode of the\u00a0Greek Gods, culminates at Mytikas peak 2,918 metres (9,573\u00a0ft),\u00a0the highest in the country. Western Greece contains a number of lakes and wetlands and is dominated by the\u00a0Pindus\u00a0mountain range. The Pindus, a continuation of the\u00a0Dinaric Alps, reaches a maximum elevation of 2,637\u00a0m (8,652\u00a0ft) at\u00a0Mt. Smolikas\u00a0(the second-highest in Greece) and historically has been a significant barrier to east-west travel.<br \/>\nThe Pindus range continues through the central Peloponnese, crosses the islands of\u00a0Kythera\u00a0and Antikythera and finds its way into southwestern Aegean, in the island of Crete where it eventually ends. The islands of the Aegean are peaks of underwater mountains that once constituted an extension of the mainland. Pindus is characterised by its high, steep peaks, often dissected by numerous canyons and a variety of other karstic landscapes. The spectacular\u00a0Vikos Gorge, part of the\u00a0Vikos-Aoos National Park\u00a0in the Pindus range, is listed by the Guinness book of World Records as the deepest gorge in the world.\u00a0Another notable formation are the\u00a0Meteora\u00a0rock pillars, atop which have been built medieval Greek Orthodox monasteries.<br \/>\nNortheastern Greece features another high-altitude mountain range, the\u00a0Rhodope\u00a0range, spreading across the region of\u00a0East Macedonia and Thrace; this area is covered with vast, thick, ancient forests, including the famous Dadia forest in the\u00a0Evros regional unit, in the far northeast of the country.<br \/>\nExtensive plains are primarily located in the regions of\u00a0Thessaly,\u00a0Central Macedonia\u00a0and\u00a0Thrace. They constitute key economic regions as they are among the few arable places in the country. Rare marine species such as the pinniped seals and the\u00a0loggerhead sea turtle\u00a0live in the seas surrounding mainland Greece, while its dense forests are home to the endangered\u00a0brown bear, the\u00a0Eurasian lynx, the\u00a0roe deer\u00a0and the wild goat.<br \/>\n<strong>Islands.\u00a0<\/strong>Greece features a\u00a0vast number of islands, between 1,200 and 6,000, depending on the definition, 227 of which are inhabited. Crete is the largest and most populous island;\u00a0Euboea, separated from the mainland by the 60m-wide\u00a0Euripus Strait, is the second largest, followed by\u00a0Lesbos\u00a0and\u00a0Rhodes.<br \/>\nThe Greek islands are traditionally grouped into the following clusters: the\u00a0Argo-Saronic Islands\u00a0in the Saronic gulf near Athens, the Cyclades, a large but dense collection occupying the central part of the Aegean Sea, the\u00a0North Aegean islands, a loose grouping off the west coast of Turkey, the Dodecanese, another loose collection in the southeast between Crete and Turkey, the\u00a0Sporades, a small tight group off the coast of northeast Euboea, and the Ionian Islands, located to the west of the mainland in the Ionian Sea.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CLIMATE<br \/>\n<\/strong>The\u00a0climate of Greece\u00a0is primarily\u00a0Mediterranean, featuring mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. This climate occurs at all coastal locations, including Athens, the Cyclades, the Dodecanese, Crete, the Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands and parts of the Central Continental Greece region. The\u00a0Pindus\u00a0mountain range strongly affects the climate of the country, as areas to the west of the range are considerably wetter on average (due to greater exposure to south-westerly systems bringing in moisture) than the areas lying to the east of the range (due to a\u00a0rain shadow\u00a0effect).<br \/>\nThe mountainous areas of Northwestern Greece (parts of\u00a0Epirus,\u00a0Central Greece,\u00a0Thessaly,\u00a0Western Macedonia) as well as in the mountainous central parts of Peloponnese\u00a0\u2013 including parts of the regional units of\u00a0Achaea,\u00a0Arcadia\u00a0and\u00a0Laconia\u00a0\u2013 feature an\u00a0Alpine climate\u00a0with heavy snowfalls. The inland parts of northern Greece, in Central Macedonia and\u00a0East Macedonia and Thrace\u00a0feature a\u00a0temperate climate\u00a0with cold, damp winters and hot, dry summers with frequent thunderstorms. Snowfalls occur every year in the mountains and northern areas, and brief snowfalls are not unknown even in low-lying southern areas, such as Athens.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ECOLOGY<br \/>\n<\/strong>Phytogeographically, Greece belongs to the\u00a0Boreal Kingdom\u00a0and is shared between the East Mediterranean province of the\u00a0Mediterranean Region\u00a0and the Illyrian province of the\u00a0Circumboreal Region. According to the\u00a0World Wide Fund for Nature\u00a0and the\u00a0European Environment Agency, the territory of Greece can be subdivided into six\u00a0ecoregions: the\u00a0Illyrian deciduous forests,\u00a0Pindus Mountains mixed forests,\u00a0Balkan mixed forests, Rhodope montane mixed forests, Aegean and Western Turkey sclerophyllous and mixed forests and Crete Mediterranean forests.<\/p>\n<p><strong>POLITICS<br \/>\n<\/strong>Greece is a\u00a0unitary\u00a0parliamentary republic.\u00a0The nominal\u00a0head of state\u00a0is the\u00a0President of the Republic, who is elected by the\u00a0Parliament\u00a0for a five-year term.\u00a0The current\u00a0Constitution\u00a0was drawn up and adopted by the Fifth Revisionary Parliament of the Hellenes and entered into force in 1975 after the fall of the\u00a0military junta of 1967\u20131974. It has been revised three times since, in\u00a01986,\u00a02001\u00a0and\u00a02008.\u00a0Women&#8217;s suffrage\u00a0was guaranteed with an amendment to the 1952 Constitution.<br \/>\nAccording to the Constitution, executive power is exercised by the President of the Republic and the\u00a0Government.\u00a0From the\u00a0Constitutional amendment of 1986\u00a0the President&#8217;s duties were curtailed to a significant extent, and they are now largely ceremonial; most political power thus lies in the hands of the Prime Minister. The position of\u00a0Prime Minister, Greece&#8217;s\u00a0head of government, belongs to the\u00a0current leader\u00a0of the\u00a0political party\u00a0that can obtain a vote of confidence by the Parliament. The President of the Republic formally appoints the Prime Minister and, on his recommendation, appoints and dismisses the other members of the Cabinet.\u00a0Legislative powers are exercised by a 300-member elective\u00a0unicameral Parliament.<br \/>\nParliamentary elections\u00a0are held every four years, but the President of the Republic is obliged to dissolve the Parliament earlier on the proposal of the Cabinet, in view of dealing with a national issue of exceptional importance.\u00a0The President is also obliged to dissolve the Parliament earlier, if the opposition manages to pass a\u00a0motion of no confidence.\u00a0The\u00a0voting age\u00a0is 17.<br \/>\nAccording to a 2016 report by the OECD, Greeks display a moderate level of civic participation compared to most other developed countries; voter turnout was 64 percent during recent elections, lower than the OECD average of 69 percent.<br \/>\n<strong>Military.<\/strong>\u00a0Greek military personnel total 367,450, of whom 142,950 are active and 220,500 are reserve. Greece\u00a0ranks 15th in the world\u00a0in the number of citizens serving in the armed forces, due largely to\u00a0compulsory military service\u00a0for males between the ages of 19 and 45 (females are exempted from conscription but may otherwise serve in the military). Mandatory military service is nine months for the Army and one year for the Navy and Air Force.\u00a0Additionally, Greek males between the ages of 18 and 60 who live in strategically sensitive areas may be required to serve part-time in the National Guard. However, as the military has sought to become a completely professional force, the government has promised to reduce mandatory military service or abolish it completely.<br \/>\nAs a member of\u00a0NATO, the Greek military participates in exercises and deployments under the auspices of the alliance, although its involvement in NATO missions is minimal.\u00a0Greece spends over US$7 billion annually on its military, or 2.3 percent of GDP, the\u00a024th-highest in the world\u00a0in absolute terms, the\u00a0seventh-highest\u00a0on a per capita basis, and the second-highest in NATO after the United States. Moreover, Greece is one of only five NATO countries to meet or surpass the minimum defence spending target of 2 percent of GDP.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ECONOMY<br \/>\n<\/strong>According to\u00a0World Bank\u00a0statistics for the year 2013, the economy of Greece is the\u00a043rd\u00a0largest by\u00a0nominal\u00a0gross domestic product\u00a0at $242 billion\u00a0and\u00a052nd\u00a0largest by\u00a0purchasing power parity\u00a0(PPP) at $284 billion. Additionally, Greece is the 15th largest economy in the 27-member\u00a0European Union.\u00a0In terms of\u00a0per capita income, Greece is ranked\u00a038th\u00a0or\u00a040th\u00a0in the world at $21,910 and $25,705 for nominal GDP and PPP respectively. The Greek economy is classified as advanced\u00a0and\u00a0high-income.<br \/>\nGreece is a\u00a0developed country\u00a0with a high standard of living and a high ranking in the\u00a0Human Development Index.<br \/>\nIts economy mainly comprises the\u00a0service sector\u00a0(85.0%) and\u00a0industry\u00a0(12.0%), while\u00a0agriculture\u00a0makes up 3.0% of the national economic output.\u00a0Important Greek industries include\u00a0tourism\u00a0(with 14.9 million\u00a0international tourists in 2009, it is ranked as the 7th most visited country in the European Union\u00a0and 16th in the world\u00a0by the\u00a0United Nations World Tourism Organization) and\u00a0merchant shipping\u00a0(at 16.2%\u00a0of the world&#8217;s total capacity, the Greek merchant marine is the largest in the world), while the country is also a considerable agricultural producer (including fisheries) within the union.<br \/>\nGreek\u00a0unemployment\u00a0stood at 21.7% in April 2017.\u00a0The\u00a0youth unemployment\u00a0rate (42.3% in March 2018) is extremely high compared to EU standards.<br \/>\nWith an economy larger than all the other Balkan economies combined, Greece is the largest economy in the Balkans,\u00a0and an important regional investor. Greece is the number-two foreign investor of capital in Albania, the number-three foreign investor in Bulgaria, at the top-three of foreign investors in Romania and Serbia and the most important trading partner and largest foreign investor of the Republic of Macedonia. Greek banks open a new branch somewhere in the Balkans on an almost weekly basis.\u00a0The Greek telecommunications company\u00a0OTE\u00a0has become a strong investor in Yugoslavia and other Balkan countries.<br \/>\nGreece was a founding member of the\u00a0Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u00a0(OECD) and the\u00a0Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation\u00a0(BSEC). In 1979 the accession of the country in the\u00a0European Communities\u00a0and the\u00a0single market\u00a0was signed, and the process was completed in 1982. Greece was accepted into the\u00a0Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union\u00a0on 19 June 2000, and in January 2001 adopted the\u00a0Euro\u00a0as its currency, replacing the\u00a0Greek drachma\u00a0at an exchange rate of 340.75 drachma to the Euro.\u00a0Greece is also a member of the\u00a0International Monetary Fund\u00a0and the\u00a0World Trade Organization, and is ranked 24th on the KOF\u00a0Globalization Index\u00a0for 2013.<br \/>\n<strong>Debt crisis (2010\u20132018).\u00a0<\/strong>By late 2009, as a result of a combination of international and local factors, the Greek economy (which had fared well for much of the 20th century, with high growth rates and low public debt) faced\u00a0its most-severe crisis\u00a0since the restoration of democracy in 1974 when the Greek government revised its deficit from an estimated 6% to 12.7% of\u00a0GDP.\u00a0In the years before the crisis\u00a0Goldman Sachs,\u00a0JPMorgan Chase, and numerous other banks had developed financial products which enabled the governments of Greece,\u00a0Italy, and many other\u00a0European\u00a0countries to hide their borrowing.\u00a0Dozens of similar agreements were concluded across Europe whereby banks supplied cash in advance in exchange for future payments by the governments involved; in turn, the liabilities of the involved countries were &#8220;kept off the books&#8221;.\u00a0These conditions had enabled Greece as well as other European governments to spend beyond their means, while meeting the deficit targets set out in the\u00a0Maastricht Treaty.<br \/>\nIn May 2010, the Greece&#8217;s deficit was again revised and estimated to be 13.6\u00a0which was the second highest in the world relative to GDP, with\u00a0Iceland\u00a0in first place at 15.7% and the\u00a0United Kingdom\u00a0in third with 12.6%.\u00a0Public debt was forecast, according to some estimates, to hit 120% of GDP in the same year,\u00a0causing a crisis of confidence in Greece&#8217;s ability pay back loans.<br \/>\nTo avert a\u00a0sovereign default, Greece, the other\u00a0Eurozone\u00a0members, and the\u00a0International Monetary Fund\u00a0agreed on a rescue package which involved giving Greece an immediate \u20ac45 billion\u00a0in loans, with additional funds to follow, totaling \u20ac110 billion. To secure the funding, Greece was required to adopt harsh\u00a0austerity measures\u00a0to bring its deficit under control.\u00a0A second bail-out amounting to \u20ac130 billion\u00a0($173 billion) was agreed in 2012, subject to strict conditions, including financial reforms and further austerity measures.\u00a0A\u00a0debt haircut\u00a0was also agreed as part of the deal.\u00a0Greece achieved a primary government\u00a0budget surplus\u00a0in 2013, while in April 2014, it returned to the global\u00a0bond market. Greece returned to growth after six years of economic decline in the second quarter of 2014,\u00a0and was the Eurozone&#8217;s fastest-growing economy in the third quarter. A third bailout was agreed in July 2015, after a confrontation with the newly-elected government of\u00a0Alexis Tsipras.<br \/>\nThere was a 25% drop in Greece&#8217;s GDP, connected with the bailout programmes.\u00a0This had a critical effect: the Debt-to-GDP ratio, the key factor defining the severity of the crisis, would jump from its 2009 level of 127% to about 170%, solely due to the shrinking economy.\u00a0In a 2013 report, the IMF admitted that it had underestimated the effects of so extensive tax hikes and budget cuts on the country&#8217;s GDP and issued an informal apology.\u00a0The Greek programmes imposed a very rapid improvement in structural primary balance (at least two times faster than for other Eurozone bailed-out countries\u00a0). The policies have been blamed for worsening the crisis,\u00a0while Greece&#8217;s President,\u00a0Prokopis Pavlopoulos, stressed the creditors&#8217; share in responsibility for the depth of the crisis.\u00a0Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, asserted that errors in the design of the first two programmes which lead to a loss of 25% of the Greek economy due to the harsh imposition of excessive austerity.<br \/>\nBetween 2009 and 2017 the Greek government debt rose from \u20ac300 bn to \u20ac318 bn, i.e. by only about 6% (thanks, in part, to the 2012 debt restructuring);\u00a0however, during the same period, the critical debt-to-GDP ratio shot up from 127% to 179%\u00a0basically due to the severe GDP drop\u00a0during the handling of the crisis.<br \/>\nGreece&#8217;s bailouts successfully ended (as declared) on August 20, 2018.<br \/>\n<strong>Agriculture.\u00a0<\/strong>In 2010, Greece was the\u00a0European Union&#8217;s largest producer of\u00a0cotton\u00a0(183,800 tons) and\u00a0pistachios\u00a0(8,000 tons)\u00a0and ranked second in the production of\u00a0rice\u00a0(229,500 tons)\u00a0and\u00a0olives\u00a0(147,500 tons),\u00a0third in the production of\u00a0figs\u00a0(11,000 tons),\u00a0almonds\u00a0(44,000 tons),\u00a0tomatoes\u00a0(1,400,000 tons),\u00a0and\u00a0watermelons\u00a0(578,400 tons)\u00a0and fourth in the production of\u00a0tobacco\u00a0(22,000 tons). Agriculture contributes 3.8% of the country&#8217;s GDP and employs 12.4% of the country&#8217;s labor force.<br \/>\nGreece is a major beneficiary of the\u00a0Common Agricultural Policy\u00a0of the European Union. As a result of the country&#8217;s entry to the European Community, much of its agricultural infrastructure has been upgraded and agricultural output increased. Between 2000 and 2007\u00a0organic farming\u00a0in Greece increased by 885%, the highest change percentage in the EU.<br \/>\n<strong>Energy.\u00a0<\/strong>Electricity production in Greece is dominated by the state-owned\u00a0Public Power Corporation\u00a0(known mostly by its acronym \u0394\u0395\u0397, or in English DEI). In 2009 DEI supplied for 85.6% of all electric energy demand in Greece,\u00a0while the number fell to 77.3% in 2010.\u00a0Almost half (48%) of DEI&#8217;s power output is generated using\u00a0lignite, a drop from the 51.6% in 2009.<br \/>\nTwelve percent of Greece&#8217;s electricity comes from hydroelectric power plants\u00a0and another 20% from\u00a0natural gas.\u00a0Between 2009 and 2010, independent companies&#8217; energy production increased by 56%,\u00a0from 2,709\u00a0Gigawatt hour\u00a0in 2009 to 4,232 GWh in 2010.<br \/>\nIn 2012, renewable energy accounted for 13.8% of the country&#8217;s total energy consumption,\u00a0a rise from the 10.6% it accounted for in 2011,\u00a0a figure almost equal to the EU average of 14.1% in 2012.\u00a010% of the country&#8217;s renewable energy comes from\u00a0solar power, while most comes from\u00a0biomass\u00a0and waste recycling.\u00a0In line with the\u00a0European Commission&#8217;s Directive on Renewable Energy, Greece aims to get 18% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020.<br \/>\nIn 2013, according to the independent power transmission operator in Greece (\u0391\u0394\u039c\u0397\u0395) more than 20% of the electricity in Greece has been produced from renewable energy sources and hydroelectric power plants. This percentage in April reached 42%. Greece currently does not have any\u00a0nuclear power plants\u00a0in operation; however, in 2009 the\u00a0Academy of Athens\u00a0suggested that research in the possibility of Greek nuclear power plants begin.<br \/>\n<strong>Maritime industry.\u00a0<\/strong>Greece\u00a0controls 16.2% of the world&#8217;s total\u00a0merchant fleet, making it the largest in the world. Greece is ranked in the top 5 for all kinds of ships, including first for tankers and bulk carriers.<br \/>\nThe shipping industry has been a key element of Greek economic activity since ancient times.\u00a0Shipping remains one of the country&#8217;s most important industries, accounting for 4.5 percent of GDP, employing about 160,000 people (4 percent of the workforce), and representing a third of the trade deficit.<\/p>\n<p>According to a 2011 report by the\u00a0United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the\u00a0Greek Merchant Navy\u00a0is the largest in the world at 16.2 percent of total global capacity,\u00a0up from 15.96 percent in 2010\u00a0but below the peak of 18.2 percent in 2006.\u00a0The country&#8217;s merchant fleet ranks first in total tonnage (202 million\u00a0dwt),\u00a0fourth in total number of ships (at 3,150), first in both\u00a0tankers\u00a0and dry\u00a0bulk carriers, fourth in the number of\u00a0containers, and fifth in other ships.\u00a0However, today&#8217;s fleet roster is smaller than an all-time high of 5,000 ships in the late 1970s.\u00a0Additionally, the total number of ships flying a Greek flag (includes non-Greek fleets) is 1,517, or 5.3 percent of the world&#8217;s dwt (ranked fifth globally).<br \/>\nDuring the 1960s, the size of the Greek fleet nearly doubled, primarily through the investment undertaken by the shipping magnates,\u00a0Aristotle Onassis\u00a0and\u00a0Stavros Niarchos.\u00a0The basis of the modern Greek maritime industry was formed after World War II when Greek shipping businessmen were able to amass surplus ships sold to them by the U.S. government through the Ship Sales Act of the 1940s.<br \/>\nGreece has a significant shipbuilding and ship maintenance industry. The six shipyards around the port of Piraeus are among the largest in Europe.\u00a0In recent years, Greece has also become a leader in the construction and maintenance of luxury yachts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TOURISM<\/strong><br \/>\nSantorini, a popular tourist destination, is ranked as the world&#8217;s top island in many travel magazines and sites.<br \/>\nTourism has been a key element of the economic activity in the country and one of the country&#8217;s most important sectors, contributing 18% of the gross domestic product.\u00a0Greece welcomed over 28 million visitors in 2016, which is an increase from the 26.5 million tourists it welcomed in 2015 and the 19.5 million in 2009,\u00a0and the 17.7 million tourists in 2007, making Greece one of the\u00a0most visited countries\u00a0in\u00a0Europe\u00a0in the recent years.<br \/>\nThe vast majority of visitors in Greece in 2007 came from the European continent, numbering 12.7 million,\u00a0while the most visitors from a single nationality were those from the United Kingdom, (2.6 million), followed closely by those from Germany (2.3 million).\u00a0In 2010, the most visited\u00a0region\u00a0of Greece was that of\u00a0Central Macedonia, with 18% of the country&#8217;s total tourist flow (amounting to 3.6 million tourists), followed by\u00a0Attica\u00a0with 2.6 million and the\u00a0Peloponnese\u00a0with 1.8 million.\u00a0Northern Greece\u00a0is the country&#8217;s most-visited geographical region, with 6.5 million tourists, while Central Greece is second with 6.3 million.<br \/>\nIn 2010,\u00a0Lonely Planet\u00a0ranked Greece&#8217;s northern and second-largest city of\u00a0Thessaloniki\u00a0as the world&#8217;s fifth-best party town worldwide, comparable to other cities such as\u00a0Dubai\u00a0and\u00a0Montreal.\u00a0In 2011,\u00a0Santorini\u00a0was voted as &#8220;The World&#8217;s Best Island&#8221; in\u00a0Travel + Leisure.\u00a0Its neighboring island\u00a0Mykonos, came in fifth in the European category. There are 18\u00a0UNESCO\u00a0World Heritage Sites\u00a0in Greece,\u00a0and Greece is ranked 16th in the world in terms of total sites. 14 further sites are on the tentative list, awaiting nomination.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DEMOGRAPHICS<br \/>\n<\/strong>According to the official statistical body of Greece, the\u00a0Hellenic Statistical Authority\u00a0(ELSTAT), the country&#8217;s total population in 2011 was 10,816,286.\u00a0The birth rate in 2003 stood at 9.5 per 1,000 inhabitants, significantly lower than the rate of 14.5 per 1,000 in 1981. At the same time, the mortality rate increased slightly from 8.9 per 1,000 inhabitants in 1981 to 9.6 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2003. Estimates from 2016 show the birth rate decreasing further still to 8.5 per 1,000 and mortality climbing to 11.2 per 1,000.<br \/>\nGreek society has changed rapidly over the last several decades, coinciding with the\u00a0wider European trend\u00a0of declining fertility and rapid aging. The fertility rate of 1.41 is below replacement levels and is one of the lowest in the world, subsequently leading to an increase in the median age to 44.2 years, the seventh-highest in the world. In 2001, 16.71 percent of the population were 65 years old and older, 68.12 percent between the ages of 15 and 64 years old, and 15.18 percent were 14 years old and younger.\u00a0By 2016, the proportion of the population age 65 and older had risen to 20.68 percent, while the proportion of those aged 14 and younger declined to slightly below 14 percent.<br \/>\nMarriage rates began declining from almost 71 per 1,000 inhabitants in 1981 until 2002, only to increase slightly in 2003 to 61 per 1,000 and then fall again to 51 in 2004. Moreover, divorce rates have seen an increase from 191.2 per 1,000 marriages in 1991 to 239.5 per 1,000 marriages in 2004.\u00a0As a result of these trends, the average Greek household is smaller and older than in previous generations.<br \/>\n<strong>Cities.\u00a0<\/strong>Almost two-thirds of the Greek people live in urban areas. Greece&#8217;s largest and most influential metropolitan centres are those of\u00a0Athens\u00a0and\u00a0Thessaloniki, which is commonly referred to in Greek as &#8220;co-capital&#8221; with metropolitan populations of approximately 4 million and 1 million inhabitants respectively. Other prominent cities with urban populations above 100,000 inhabitants include those of\u00a0Patras,\u00a0Heraklion,\u00a0Larissa,\u00a0Volos,\u00a0Rhodes,\u00a0Ioannina,\u00a0Agrinio,\u00a0Chania, and\u00a0Chalcis.<\/p>\n<p><strong>RELGION <\/strong>Religiosity in Greece (2015):\u00a0Eastern Orthodoxy\u00a0(90%),\u00a0Other\u00a0Christians\u00a0(exc.Catholics) (3%),\u00a0Irreligion\u00a0(4%),Islam\u00a0(2%),\u00a0Other religions (inc.Catholics) (1%)<br \/>\nThe Greek Constitution recognizes\u00a0<strong>Eastern Orthodoxy<\/strong>\u00a0as the &#8220;prevailing&#8221; faith of the country, while guaranteeing freedom of religious belief for all.\u00a0The Greek government does not keep statistics on religious groups and censuses do not ask for religious affiliation. According to the U.S. State Department, an estimated 97% of Greek citizens identify themselves as\u00a0Eastern Orthodox, belonging to the\u00a0Greek Orthodox Church,\u00a0which uses the\u00a0Byzantine rite\u00a0and the\u00a0Greek language, the original language of the\u00a0New Testament. The administration of the Greek territory is shared between the\u00a0Church of Greece\u00a0and the\u00a0Patriarchate of Constantinople.<br \/>\nIn a\u00a0Eurostat\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Eurobarometer\u00a02010 poll, 79% of Greek citizens responded that they &#8220;believe there is a God&#8221;.\u00a0According to other sources, 15.8% of Greeks describe themselves as &#8220;very religious&#8221;, which is the highest among all European countries. The survey also found that just 3.5% never attend a church, compared to 4.9% in Poland and 59.1% in the Czech Republic.<br \/>\n<strong>Islam.<\/strong> Estimates of the recognised\u00a0Greek Muslim minority, which is mostly located in\u00a0Thrace, range around 100,000,\u00a0(about 1% of the population). Some of the Albanian immigrants to Greece come from a nominally Muslim background, although most are secular in orientation.\u00a0Following the\u00a01919\u20131922 Greco-Turkish War\u00a0and the 1923\u00a0Treaty of Lausanne, Greece and Turkey agreed to a\u00a0population transfer based on cultural and religious identity. About 500,000 Muslims from Greece, predominantly those defined as\u00a0Turks, but also\u00a0Greek Muslims\u00a0like the\u00a0Vallahades\u00a0of western Macedonia, were exchanged with approximately 1,500,000 Greeks from Turkey. However, many refugees who settled in former Ottoman Muslim villages in\u00a0Central Macedonia\u00a0and were defined as Christian Orthodox\u00a0Caucasus Greeks arrived from the former Russian\u00a0Transcaucasus\u00a0province of\u00a0Kars Oblast\u00a0after it had been retroceded to Turkey but in the few years before the official population exchange.<br \/>\n<strong>Judaism<\/strong> has\u00a0been present\u00a0in Greece for more than 2,000 years. The ancient community of Greek Jews are called\u00a0Romaniotes, while the\u00a0Sephardi Jews\u00a0were once a prominent community in the city of\u00a0Thessaloniki, numbering some 80,000, or more than half of the population, by 1900.\u00a0However, after the\u00a0German occupation of Greece\u00a0and\u00a0the Holocaust\u00a0during World War II, is estimated to number around 5,500 people.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0<strong>Roman Catholic<\/strong>\u00a0community is estimated to be around 250,000\u00a0of which 50,000 are Greek citizens.\u00a0Their community\u00a0is nominally separate from the smaller\u00a0Greek Byzantine Catholic Church, which recognizes the primacy of the\u00a0Pope\u00a0but maintains the\u00a0liturgy\u00a0of the\u00a0Byzantine Rite.\u00a0Old Calendarists\u00a0account for 500,000 followers.<br \/>\n<strong>Protestants<\/strong>, including the\u00a0Greek Evangelical Church\u00a0and\u00a0Free Evangelical Churches, stand at about 30,000.\u00a0Other Christian minorities, such as\u00a0Assemblies of God,\u00a0International Church of the Foursquare Gospel\u00a0and various\u00a0Pentecostal\u00a0churches of the\u00a0Greek Synod of Apostolic Church\u00a0total about 12,000 members.\u00a0The independent\u00a0Free Apostolic Church of Pentecost\u00a0is the biggest Protestant denomination in Greece with 120 churches.\u00a0There are no official statistics about Free Apostolic Church of Pentecost, but the Orthodox Church estimates the followers as 20,000.\u00a0The\u00a0Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses\u00a0report having 28,874 active members.<br \/>\nSince 2017,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hellenism_(religion)\"><strong>Hellenic Polytheism<\/strong><\/a>, or Helenism has been legally recognised as an actively practiced religion in Greece, with estimates of 2,000 active practitioners and an additional 100,000 &#8220;sympathisers&#8221;.\u00a0Hellenism refers to various religious movements that continue, revive or reconstruct\u00a0ancient Greek religious practices.<\/p>\n<p><strong>LANGUAGES<br \/>\n<\/strong>Today, Greek is the dominant language throughout the country.<br \/>\nThe first textual evidence of the Greek language dates back to 15th century BC and the\u00a0Linear B\u00a0script which is associated with the\u00a0Mycenaean Civilization. Greek was a widely spoken\u00a0lingua franca\u00a0in the Mediterranean world and beyond during\u00a0Classical Antiquity, and would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire.<br \/>\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries there was a major dispute known as the\u00a0Greek language question, on whether the official language of Greece should be the archaic\u00a0Katharevousa, created in the 19th century and used as the state and scholarly language, or the\u00a0Dimotiki, the form of the\u00a0Greek language\u00a0which evolved naturally from\u00a0Byzantine Greek\u00a0and was the language of the people. The dispute was finally resolved in 1976, when Dimotiki was made the only official variation of the Greek language, and Katharevousa fell to disuse.<br \/>\nGreece is today relatively homogeneous in linguistic terms, with a large majority of the native population using Greek as their first or only language. Among the Greek-speaking population, speakers of the distinctive\u00a0Pontic\u00a0dialect came to Greece from Asia Minor after the\u00a0Greek genocide\u00a0and constitute a sizable group. The\u00a0Cappadocian\u00a0dialect came to Greece due to the genocide as well, but is endangered and is barely spoken now. Indigenous Greek dialects include the archaic Greek spoken by the\u00a0Sarakatsani, traditionally transhument mountain shepherds of\u00a0Greek Macedonia\u00a0and other parts of\u00a0Northern Greece. The\u00a0Tsakonian language, a distinct Greek language deriving from\u00a0Doric Greek\u00a0instead of\u00a0Koine Greek, is still spoken in some villages in the southeastern Peloponnese.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Muslim minority\u00a0in Thrace, which amounts to approximately 0.95% of the total population, consists of speakers of\u00a0Turkish,\u00a0Bulgarian\u00a0(Pomaks)\u00a0and\u00a0Romani. Romani is also spoken by Christian\u00a0Roma\u00a0in other parts of the country. Further minority languages have traditionally been spoken by regional population groups in various parts of the country. Their use has decreased radically in the course of the 20th century through assimilation with the Greek-speaking majority.<br \/>\nToday they are only maintained by the older generations and are on the verge of extinction. This goes for the\u00a0Arvanites, an\u00a0Albanian-speaking group mostly located in the rural areas around the capital Athens, and for the\u00a0Aromanians\u00a0and\u00a0Moglenites, also known as\u00a0Vlachs, whose language is closely related to\u00a0Romanian\u00a0and who used to live scattered across several areas of mountainous central Greece. Members of these groups ethnically identify as Greeks\u00a0and are today all at least bilingual in Greek.<br \/>\nNear the northern Greek borders there are also some\u00a0Slavic\u2013speaking groups, locally known as\u00a0Slavomacedonian-speaking, most of whose members identify ethnically as Greeks. It is estimated that after the population exchanges of 1923,\u00a0Macedonia\u00a0had 200,000 to 400,000\u00a0Slavic\u00a0speakers.\u00a0The Jewish community in Greece traditionally spoke\u00a0Ladino\u00a0(Judeo-Spanish), today maintained only by a few thousand speakers. Other notable minority languages include\u00a0Armenian,\u00a0Georgian, and the Greco-Turkic dialect spoken by the\u00a0Urums, a community of\u00a0Caucasus Greeks\u00a0from the\u00a0Tsalka\u00a0region of central Georgia and ethnic Greeks from southeastern\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0who arrived in mainly Northern Greece as economic migrants in the 1990s.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MIGRATION<br \/>\n<\/strong>Throughout the 20th century, millions of Greeks migrated to the\u00a0United States,\u00a0United Kingdom,\u00a0Australia,\u00a0Canada, and\u00a0Germany, creating a large\u00a0Greek diaspora. Net migration started to show positive numbers from the 1970s, but until the beginning of the 1990s, the main influx was that of returning Greek migrants or of\u00a0Pontic Greeks\u00a0and others from\u00a0Russia,\u00a0Georgia,\u00a0Turkey\u00a0the\u00a0Czech Republic, and elsewhere in the former\u00a0Soviet Bloc.<br \/>\nA study from the Mediterranean Migration Observatory maintains that the 2001 census recorded 762,191 persons residing in Greece without Greek citizenship, constituting around 7% of total population. Of the non-citizen residents, 48,560 were EU or\u00a0European Free Trade Association\u00a0nationals and 17,426 were Cypriots with privileged status. The majority come from Eastern European countries: Albania (56%), Bulgaria (5%) and Romania (3%), while migrants from the former Soviet Union (Georgia, Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, etc.) comprise 10% of the total.\u00a0Some of the immigrants from Albania are from the\u00a0Greek minority in Albania centred on the region of\u00a0Northern Epirus. In addition the total Albanian national population which includes temporary migrants and undocumented persons is around 600,000.<br \/>\nThe\u00a02011 census\u00a0recorded 9,903,268 Greek citizens (91,56%), 480,824\u00a0Albanian\u00a0citizens (4,44%), 75,915\u00a0Bulgarian\u00a0citizens (0,7%), 46,523\u00a0Romanian\u00a0citizenship (0,43%), 34,177\u00a0Pakistani\u00a0citizens (0,32%), 27,400\u00a0Georgian\u00a0citizens (0,25%) and 247,090 people had other or unidentified citizenship (2,3%). 189,000 people of the total population of Albanian citizens were reported in 2008 as ethnic Greeks from\u00a0Southern Albania, in the historical region of\u00a0Northern Epirus.<br \/>\nThe greatest cluster of non-EU\u00a0immigrant\u00a0population are the larger urban centers, especially the Municipality of Athens, with 132,000 immigrants comprising 17% of the local population, and then Thessaloniki, with 27,000 immigrants reaching 7% of the local population. There is also a considerable number of co-ethnics that came from the Greek communities of Albania and the former\u00a0Soviet Union.<br \/>\nGreece, together with\u00a0Italy\u00a0and Spain, is a major entry point for\u00a0illegal immigrants trying to enter the EU. Illegal immigrants entering Greece mostly do so from the border with\u00a0Turkey\u00a0at the\u00a0Evros River\u00a0and the islands of the eastern Aegean across from Turkey (mainly\u00a0Lesbos,\u00a0Chios,\u00a0Kos, and\u00a0Samos). In 2012, the majority of illegal immigrants entering Greece came from\u00a0Afghanistan, followed by\u00a0Pakistanis\u00a0and\u00a0Bangladeshis.\u00a0In 2015, arrivals of refugees by sea had increased dramatically mainly due to the ongoing\u00a0Syrian civil war. There were 856,723 arrivals by sea in Greece, an almost fivefold increase to the same period of 2014, of which the\u00a0Syrians\u00a0represent almost 45%.\u00a0The majority of refugees and migrants use Greece as a transit country, while their intended destinations are northern European Nations such as\u00a0Austria,\u00a0Germany\u00a0and\u00a0Sweden.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HEALTHCARE<br \/>\n<\/strong>Greece has\u00a0universal health care. In a 2000\u00a0World Health Organization\u00a0report, its\u00a0health care system\u00a0ranked 14th in overall performance of 191 countries surveyed.\u00a0In a 2013\u00a0Save the Children\u00a0report, Greece was ranked the 19th best country (out of 176 countries surveyed) for the state of mothers and newborn babies.\u00a0In 2010, there were 138 hospitals with 31,000 beds in the country, but on 1 July 2011, the\u00a0Ministry for Health and Social Solidarity\u00a0announced its plans to decrease the number to 77 hospitals with 36,035 beds, as a necessary reform to reduce expenses and further enhance healthcare standards.\u00a0Greece&#8217;s healthcare expenditures as a percentage of GDP were 9.6% in 2007 according to a 2011\u00a0OECD\u00a0report, just above the OECD average of 9.5%.\u00a0The country has the largest number of doctors-to-population ratio of any OECD country.<\/p>\n<p>Life expectancy\u00a0in Greece is 80.3 years, above the OECD average of 79.5,\u00a0and among the highest in the world. The island of\u00a0Icaria\u00a0has the highest percentage of 90-year-olds in the world; approximately 33% of the islanders make it to 90 (and beyond).\u00a0Blue Zones\u00a0author\u00a0Dan Buettner\u00a0wrote an article in\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0about the longevity of Icarians under the title &#8220;The Island Where People Forget to Die&#8221;.<br \/>\nThe 2011 OECD report showed that Greece had the largest percentage of adult daily smokers of any of the 34 OECD members.\u00a0The country&#8217;s obesity rate is 18.1%, which is above the OECD average of 15.1%, but considerably lower than the\u00a0American\u00a0rate of 27.7%.\u00a0In 2008, Greece had the highest rate of perceived good health in the OECD, at 98.5%.\u00a0Infant mortality, with a rate of 3.6 deaths per 1,000 live births, was below the 2007 OECD average of 4.9.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CULTURE<br \/>\n<\/strong>The culture of Greece has evolved over thousands of years, beginning in\u00a0Mycenaean Greece\u00a0and continuing most notably into\u00a0Classical Greece, through the influence of the\u00a0Roman Empire\u00a0and its\u00a0Greek Eastern\u00a0continuation, the Eastern Roman or\u00a0Byzantine Empire. Other cultures and nations, such as the\u00a0Latin and Frankish states, the\u00a0Ottoman Empire, the\u00a0Venetian Republic, the\u00a0Genoese Republic, and the\u00a0British Empire\u00a0have also left their influence on modern Greek culture, although historians credit the\u00a0Greek War of Independence\u00a0with revitalising Greece and giving birth to a single, cohesive entity of its multi-faceted culture.<br \/>\nIn ancient times, Greece was the birthplace of\u00a0Western culture.\u00a0Modern democracies owe a debt to Greek beliefs in government by the people, trial by jury, and equality under the law. The ancient Greeks pioneered in many fields that rely on systematic thought, including biology, geometry, history,\u00a0philosophy,\u00a0physics and mathematics.\u00a0They introduced such important literary forms as epic and lyric poetry, history, tragedy, and comedy. In their pursuit of order and proportion, the Greeks created an ideal of beauty that strongly influenced\u00a0Western art.<br \/>\n<strong>Architecture.\u00a0<\/strong>The architecture of ancient Greece was produced by the ancient Greeks (Hellenes), whose\u00a0culture\u00a0flourished on the Greek mainland, the\u00a0Aegean Islands\u00a0and their\u00a0colonies, for a period from about 900 BC until the 1st century AD, with the earliest remaining architectural works dating from around 600 BC. The formal vocabulary of ancient Greek architecture, in particular the division of architectural style into three defined orders: the\u00a0Doric Order, the\u00a0Ionic Order\u00a0and the\u00a0Corinthian Order, was to have profound effect on\u00a0Western architecture\u00a0of later periods.<br \/>\nByzantine architecture is the\u00a0architecture\u00a0promoted by the\u00a0Byzantine Empire, also known as the Eastern Roman Empire, which dominated Greece and the Greek speaking world during the Middle Ages. The empire endured for more than a\u00a0millennium, dramatically influencing\u00a0Medieval architecture\u00a0throughout Europe and the Near East, and becoming the primary progenitor of the\u00a0Renaissance\u00a0and\u00a0Ottoman architectural\u00a0traditions that followed its collapse.<br \/>\nAfter the\u00a0Greek Independence, the modern Greek architects tried to combine traditional Greek and Byzantine elements and motives with the western European movements and styles.\u00a0Patras\u00a0was the first city of the modern Greek state to develop a city plan.<br \/>\nTwo special genres can be considered the\u00a0Cycladic architecture, featuring white-coloured houses, in the\u00a0Cyclades\u00a0and the\u00a0Epirotic architecture\u00a0in the region of\u00a0Epirus.<br \/>\nAfter the establishment of the\u00a0Greek Kingdom, the architecture of Athens and other cities was mostly influenced by the\u00a0Neoclassical architecture. For Athens, the first\u00a0King of Greece,\u00a0Otto of Greece, commissioned the architects\u00a0Stamatios Kleanthis\u00a0and\u00a0Eduard Schaubert\u00a0to design a modern city plan fit for the capital of a state. As for\u00a0Thessaloniki, after the\u00a0fire of 1917, the government ordered for a new city plan under the supervision of\u00a0Ernest H\u00e9brard. Other modern Greek architects include\u00a0Anastasios Metaxas,\u00a0Panagis Kalkos,\u00a0Ernst Ziller,\u00a0Dimitris Pikionis\u00a0and\u00a0Georges Candilis.<br \/>\n<strong>Theatre.<\/strong>\u00a0Theatre in its western form was born in Greece.\u00a0The\u00a0city-state\u00a0of\u00a0Classical Athens, which became a significant cultural, political, and military power during this period, was its centre, where it was\u00a0institutionalised\u00a0as part of a\u00a0festival\u00a0called the\u00a0Dionysia, which honoured the god\u00a0Dionysus.\u00a0Tragedy\u00a0(late 6th century BC),\u00a0comedy\u00a0(486 BC), and the\u00a0satyr play\u00a0were the three\u00a0dramatic\u00a0genres\u00a0to emerge there.<br \/>\nDuring the Byzantine period, the theatrical art was heavily declined. According to Marios Ploritis, the only form survived was the folk theatre (Mimos\u00a0and\u00a0Pantomimos), despite the hostility of the official state. Later, during the Ottoman period, the main theatrical folk art was the\u00a0Karagiozis. The renaissance which led to the modern Greek theatre, took place in the\u00a0Venetian Crete. Significal dramatists include\u00a0Vitsentzos Kornaros\u00a0and\u00a0Georgios Chortatzis.<br \/>\n<strong>Literature.\u00a0<\/strong>Greek literature can be divided into three main categories: Ancient, Byzantine and modern Greek literature.<br \/>\nAthens is considered the birthplace of Western literature.\u00a0At the beginning of Greek literature stand the two monumental works of\u00a0Homer: the\u00a0Iliad\u00a0and the\u00a0Odyssey. Though dates of composition vary, these works were fixed around 800\u00a0BC or after. In the classical period many of the genres of western literature became more prominent.\u00a0Lyrical poetry,\u00a0odes,\u00a0pastorals,\u00a0elegies,\u00a0epigrams; dramatic presentations of comedy and\u00a0tragedy;\u00a0historiography,\u00a0rhetorical\u00a0treatises, philosophical dialectics, and philosophical treatises all arose in this period. The two major lyrical poets were\u00a0Sappho\u00a0and\u00a0Pindar. The Classical era also saw the dawn of drama.<br \/>\nOf the hundreds of\u00a0tragedies\u00a0written and performed during the classical age, only a limited number of plays by three authors have survived: those of\u00a0Aeschylus,\u00a0Sophocles, and\u00a0Euripides. The surviving plays by\u00a0Aristophanes\u00a0are also a treasure trove of comic presentation, while\u00a0Herodotus\u00a0and\u00a0Thucydides\u00a0are two of the most influential historians in this period. The greatest prose achievement of the 4th century was in philosophy with the works of the three great philosophers.<br \/>\nByzantine literature\u00a0refers to literature of the Byzantine Empire written in\u00a0Atticizing,\u00a0Medieval\u00a0and early\u00a0Modern Greek, and it is the expression of the intellectual life of the\u00a0Byzantine Greeks\u00a0during the Christian\u00a0Middle Ages. Although\u00a0popular\u00a0Byzantine literature and early\u00a0Modern Greek literature\u00a0both began in the 11th century, the two are indistinguishable.<br \/>\nModern Greek literature\u00a0refers to literature written in common Modern Greek, emerging from late Byzantine times in the 11th century. The Cretan Renaissance poem\u00a0Erotokritos\u00a0is undoubtedly the masterpiece of this period of Greek literature. It is a verse\u00a0romance\u00a0written around 1600 by\u00a0Vitsentzos Kornaros\u00a0(1553\u20131613). Later, during the period of Greek enlightenment (Diafotismos), writers such as\u00a0Adamantios Korais\u00a0and\u00a0Rigas Feraios\u00a0prepared with their works the\u00a0Greek Revolution\u00a0(1821\u20131830).<br \/>\n<strong>Philosophy.\u00a0<\/strong>Most western philosophical traditions began in\u00a0Ancient Greece\u00a0in the 6th century BC. The first philosophers are called &#8220;Presocratics,&#8221; which designates that they came before\u00a0Socrates, whose contributions mark a turning point in western thought. The Presocratics were from the western or the eastern colonies of Greece and only fragments of their original writings survive, in some cases merely a single sentence.<br \/>\nA new period of philosophy started with Socrates. Like the\u00a0Sophists, he rejected entirely the physical speculations in which his predecessors had indulged, and made the thoughts and opinions of people his starting-point. Aspects of Socrates were first united from\u00a0Plato, who also combined with them many of the principles established by earlier philosophers, and developed the whole of this material into the unity of a comprehensive system.<br \/>\nAristotle\u00a0of\u00a0Stagira, the most important disciple of Plato, shared with his teacher the title of the greatest philosopher of antiquity. But while Plato had sought to elucidate and explain things from the supra-sensual standpoint of the forms, his pupil preferred to start from the facts given us by experience. Except from these three most significant Greek philosophers other known schools of\u00a0Greek philosophy\u00a0from other founders during ancient times were\u00a0Stoicism,\u00a0Epicureanism,\u00a0Skepticism\u00a0and\u00a0Neoplatonism.<br \/>\nByzantine philosophy\u00a0refers to the distinctive philosophical ideas of the philosophers and scholars of the\u00a0Byzantine Empire, especially between the 8th and 15th centuries. It was characterised by a\u00a0Christian\u00a0world-view, but one which could draw ideas directly from the Greek texts of\u00a0Plato,\u00a0Aristotle, and the\u00a0Neoplatonists.<br \/>\nOn the eve of the\u00a0Fall of Constantinople,\u00a0Gemistus Pletho\u00a0tried to restore the use of the term &#8220;Hellene&#8221; and advocated the return to the\u00a0Olympian Gods\u00a0of the ancient world. After 1453 a number of\u00a0Greek Byzantine scholars\u00a0who fled to western Europe contributed to the\u00a0Renaissance.<br \/>\n<strong>Music and dances.\u00a0<\/strong>Greek vocal music extends far back into ancient times where mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment, celebration and spiritual reasons. Instruments during that period included the double-reed\u00a0aulos\u00a0and the plucked string instrument, the\u00a0lyre, especially the special kind called a\u00a0kithara. Music played an important role in the education system during ancient times. Boys were taught music from the age of six. Later influences from the\u00a0Roman Empire, Middle East, and the\u00a0Byzantine Empire\u00a0also had effect on Greek music.<br \/>\nWhile the new technique of polyphony was developing in the West, the\u00a0Eastern Orthodox Church\u00a0resisted any type of change. Therefore,\u00a0Byzantine music\u00a0remained monophonic and without any form of instrumental accompaniment. As a result, and despite certain attempts by certain Greek chanters (such as Manouel Gazis, Ioannis Plousiadinos or the Cypriot Ieronimos o Tragoudistis), Byzantine music was deprived of elements of which in the West encouraged an unimpeded development of art. However, this method which kept music away from polyphony, along with centuries of continuous culture, enabled monophonic music to develop to the greatest heights of perfection. Byzantium presented the monophonic\u00a0Byzantine chant; a melodic treasury of inestimable value for its rhythmical variety and expressive power.<br \/>\nAlong with the Byzantine (Church) chant and music, the Greek people also cultivated the\u00a0Greek folk song\u00a0(Demotiko) which is divided into two cycles, the\u00a0akritic\u00a0and\u00a0klephtic. The akritic was created between the 9th and 10th centuries and expressed the life and struggles of the\u00a0akrites\u00a0(frontier guards) of the Byzantine empire, the most well known being the stories associated with\u00a0Digenes Akritas. The klephtic cycle came into being between the late Byzantine period and the start of the\u00a0Greek War of Independence. The klephtic cycle, together with historical songs,\u00a0paraloghes\u00a0(narrative song or ballad), love songs,\u00a0mantinades, wedding songs, songs of exile and dirges express the life of the Greeks. There is a unity between the Greek people&#8217;s struggles for freedom, their joys and sorrow and attitudes towards love and death.]<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Heptanesean\u00a0kant\u00e1dhes\u00a0became the forerunners of the Greek modern urban popular song, influencing its development to a considerable degree. For the first part of the next century, several Greek composers continued to borrow elements from the Heptanesean style. The most successful songs during the period 1870\u20131930 were the so-called Athenian serenades, and the songs performed on stage (&#8216;theatrical revue songs&#8217;) in\u00a0revue,\u00a0operettas\u00a0and\u00a0nocturnes\u00a0that were dominating Athens&#8217; theater scene.<br \/>\nRebetiko, initially a music associated with the lower classes, later (and especially after the\u00a0population exchange between Greece and Turkey) reached greater general acceptance as the rough edges of its overt subcultural character were softened and polished, sometimes to the point of unrecognizability. It was the base of the later\u00a0la\u00efk\u00f3\u00a0(song of the people). The leading performers of the genre include\u00a0Vassilis Tsitsanis,\u00a0Grigoris Bithikotsis,\u00a0Stelios Kazantzidis,\u00a0George Dalaras,\u00a0Haris Alexiou\u00a0and\u00a0Glykeria.<br \/>\nRegarding the classical music, it was through the\u00a0Ionian islands\u00a0(which were under western rule and influence) that all the major advances of the western European classical music were introduced to mainland Greeks. The region is notable for the birth of the first School of modern Greek classical music (Heptanesean or Ionian School, Greek established in 1815. Prominent representatives of this genre include\u00a0Nikolaos Mantzaros,\u00a0Spyridon Xyndas,\u00a0Spyridon Samaras\u00a0and\u00a0Pavlos Carrer.\u00a0Manolis Kalomiris\u00a0is considered the founder of the Greek National School of Music.<br \/>\nIn the 20th century, Greek composers have had a significant impact on the development of\u00a0avant garde\u00a0and modern\u00a0classical music, with figures such as\u00a0Iannis Xenakis,\u00a0Nikos Skalkottas, and\u00a0Dimitri Mitropoulos\u00a0achieving international prominence. At the same time, composers and musicians such as\u00a0Mikis Theodorakis,\u00a0Manos Hatzidakis,\u00a0Eleni Karaindrou,\u00a0Vangelis\u00a0and\u00a0Demis Roussos\u00a0garnered an international following for their music, which include famous\u00a0film scores\u00a0such as\u00a0Zorba the Greek,\u00a0Serpico,\u00a0Never on Sunday,\u00a0America America,\u00a0Eternity and a Day,\u00a0Chariots of Fire,\u00a0Blade Runner, among others.\u00a0Greek American\u00a0composers known for their film scores include also\u00a0Yanni\u00a0and\u00a0Basil Poledouris. Notable Greek\u00a0opera\u00a0singers and\u00a0classical musicians\u00a0of the 20th and 21st century include\u00a0Maria Callas,\u00a0Nana Mouskouri,\u00a0Mario Frangoulis,\u00a0Leonidas Kavakos,\u00a0Dimitris Sgouros\u00a0and others.<br \/>\nDuring the\u00a0dictatorship of the Colonels, the music of Mikis Theodorakis was banned by the junta and the composer was jailed, internally exiled, and put in a\u00a0concentration camp,\u00a0before finally being allowed to leave Greece due to international reaction to his detention. Released during the junta years,\u00a0Anthrope Agapa, ti Fotia Stamata\u00a0(Make Love, Stop the Gunfire), by the\u00a0pop\u00a0group\u00a0Poll\u00a0is considered the first anti-war protest song in the history of\u00a0Greek rock.\u00a0The song was echoing the hippie slogan\u00a0Make love, not war\u00a0and was inspired directly by the\u00a0Vietnam War, becoming a &#8220;smash hit&#8221; in Greece.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CUISINE<br \/>\n<\/strong>Greek cuisine\u00a0is characteristic of the healthy\u00a0Mediterranean diet, which is epitomised by dishes of\u00a0Crete.\u00a0Greek cuisine incorporates fresh ingredients into a variety of local dishes such as\u00a0moussaka,\u00a0pastitsio, classic\u00a0Greek salad,\u00a0fasolada,\u00a0spanakopita\u00a0and\u00a0souvlaki. Some dishes can be traced back to ancient Greece like\u00a0skordalia\u00a0(a thick pur\u00e9e of walnuts, almonds, crushed garlic and olive oil),\u00a0lentil\u00a0soup,\u00a0retsina\u00a0(white or ros\u00e9 wine sealed with pine resin) and\u00a0pasteli\u00a0(candy bar with sesame seeds baked with honey). Throughout Greece people often enjoy eating from small dishes such as\u00a0meze\u00a0with various dips such as\u00a0tzatziki, grilled octopus and small fish,\u00a0feta cheese,\u00a0dolmades\u00a0(rice, currants and pine kernels wrapped in vine leaves), various\u00a0pulses,\u00a0olives\u00a0and cheese.\u00a0Olive oil\u00a0is added to almost every dish.<br \/>\nSome sweet desserts include\u00a0melomakarona,\u00a0diples\u00a0and\u00a0galaktoboureko, and drinks such as\u00a0ouzo,\u00a0metaxa\u00a0and a variety of wines including retsina. Greek cuisine differs widely from different parts of the mainland and from island to island. It uses some flavorings more often than other Mediterranean cuisines:\u00a0oregano,\u00a0mint, garlic,\u00a0onion,\u00a0dill\u00a0and\u00a0bay laurel\u00a0leaves. Other common herbs and spices include\u00a0basil,\u00a0thyme\u00a0and\u00a0fennel\u00a0seed. Many Greek recipes, especially in the northern parts of the country, use &#8220;sweet&#8221; spices in combination with meat, for example\u00a0cinnamon\u00a0and\u00a0cloves\u00a0in stews.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SPORTS<br \/>\n<\/strong>Greece is the birthplace of the\u00a0ancient Olympic Games, first recorded in 776 BC in\u00a0Olympia, and hosted the modern\u00a0Olympic Games\u00a0twice, the inaugural\u00a01896 Summer Olympics\u00a0and the\u00a02004 Summer Olympics. During the parade of nations Greece is always called first, as the founding nation of the ancient precursor of modern Olympics. The nation has competed at every\u00a0Summer Olympic Games, one of only four countries to have done so. Having won a total of 110 medals (30 gold, 42 silver and 38 bronze), Greece is ranked 32nd by gold medals in the\u00a0all-time Summer Olympic medal count. Their best ever performance was in the 1896 Summer Olympics, when Greece finished second in the\u00a0medal table\u00a0with 10 gold medals.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Greek national football team, ranking 12th in the\u00a0world\u00a0in 2014 (and having reached a high of 8th in the world in 2008 and 2011), were crowned\u00a0European Champions\u00a0in\u00a0Euro 2004\u00a0in one of the biggest upsets in the history of the sport.\u00a0The\u00a0Greek Super League\u00a0is the highest professional football league in the country, comprising sixteen teams.

After the\u00a02005 European Championship\u00a0triumph of the Greek national basketball team, Greece became the reigning European Champion in both football and basketball.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MYTHOLOGY<br \/>\n<\/strong>The numerous gods of the\u00a0ancient Greek religion\u00a0as well as the mythical heroes and events of the ancient Greek\u00a0epics\u00a0(The Odyssey\u00a0and\u00a0The Iliad) and other pieces of art and literature from the time make up what is nowadays colloquially referred to as Greek mythology. Apart from serving a religious function, the mythology of the\u00a0ancient Greek\u00a0world also served a cosmological role as it was meant to try to explain how the world was formed and operated.<br \/>\nThe principal gods of the ancient Greek religion were the\u00a0Dodekatheon, or the\u00a0Twelve Gods, who lived on the top of Mount Olympus. The most important of all ancient Greek gods was\u00a0Zeus, the king of the gods, who was married to\u00a0Hera, who was also Zeus&#8217;s sister. The other Greek gods that made up the\u00a0Twelve Olympians\u00a0were\u00a0Ares,\u00a0Poseidon,\u00a0Athena,\u00a0Demeter,\u00a0Dionysus,\u00a0Apollo,\u00a0Artemis,\u00a0Aphrodite,\u00a0Hephaestus\u00a0and\u00a0Hermes. Apart from these twelve gods, Greeks also had a variety of other mystical beliefs, such as\u00a0nymphs\u00a0and other magical creatures.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>PUBLIC HOLIDAYS<br \/>\n<\/strong>According to Greek law, every Sunday of the year is a public holiday. Since the late &#8217;70s, Saturday also is a non school and not working day. In addition, there are four mandatory official public holidays: 25 March (Greek Independence Day),\u00a0Easter Monday, 15 August (Assumption or Dormition of the Holy Virgin), and 25 December (Christmas). 1 May (Labour Day) and 28 October (Ohi Day) are regulated by law as being optional but it is customary for employees to be given the day off. There are, however, more public holidays celebrated in Greece than are announced by the Ministry of Labour each year as either obligatory or optional.
