We went to several lookouts, walked in a big sandstorm and watched the sunset over the desert.<br \/>\nI had crossed into Chile over a 4900m pass in a 4WD and transferred to a bus for the 30-minute drive to <strong>San Pedro de Atacama<\/strong> (pop 3200, elevation 2440), an oasis in the middle of the desert. 10 years ago there were 5 hotels here and now 100, with many restaurants and tour agencies. Every tour company offers the same tours \u2013 to the salt flats, geyser fields, sand boarding on the dunes, and lakes. It is a major stop on the gringo trail. Many skip the very northern part of Chili. San Pedro has narrow dirt streets lined with one-story buildings and adobe walls.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gochile.cl\/en\/articles\/valley-of-the-moon-a-sunset-like-no-other.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwiMtZfZq6_gAhUKGhQKHXd4BnEQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/www.gochile.cl\/fotos\/header\/107646-valle-de-la-luna-1.jpg\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"586\" height=\"228\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.gochile.cl\/fotos\/header\/107646-valle-de-la-luna-1.jpg\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wanderlustchloe.com\/adventures-in-el-valle-de-la-luna-chile\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwih_fzDq6_gAhXNAGMBHX48CeQQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wanderlustchloe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Lunar-Valley-Atacama-Chile-1.jpg\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"586\" height=\"439\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.wanderlustchloe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Lunar-Valley-Atacama-Chile-1.jpg\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nThat night I went to an astronomy show with 10 telescopes run by a Canadian from Hamilton.<br \/>\nThis was the first day of the Atacama section of the four desert ultramarathons (the others are in the Sahara in southern Morocco \u2013 hottest, Gobi desert in Mongolia \u2013 windiest, and the Antarctic \u2013 coldest), all about 260kms long involving about a marathon a day carrying 9 kg packs over 6 days.
