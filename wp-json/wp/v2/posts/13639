Construction began in 1967 and was completed in 1973.<br \/>\nIt rises 650 feet (195m) above the river bed and is 1km wide. It tallest dam in Canada and the second tallest in North America after the Chicoas\u00e9n. The world&#8217;s largest earth-filled dam, it created an inland sea called Kinbasket Lake that is 216kms (135 miles) long (427-square-kilometre (165 sq mi) reservoir containing 15 cubic kilometres (12,000,000 acre\u22c5ft) of live storage and 24.8 cubic kilometres (20,100,000 acre\u22c5ft) of total storage. The dam&#8217;s underground powerhouse was the second largest in the world at the time of its construction and was the first 500 kV installation of sulphur hexafluoride (SF<span style=\"line-height: 1; font-size: 10px; height: 0px; position: relative; vertical-align: baseline; top: 0.5ex;\">6<\/span>) insulated\u00a0switchgear\u00a0in the world.<br \/>\nThe underground powerhouse, begun in 1973, was built to be 54 metres (177 ft) high, 24 metres (79 ft) wide and 237 metres (778 ft) long. In 1976, the first two electrical generators were commissioned, and in 1977 two more were completed bringing the total capacity of the powerhouse to 1,805 MW. Another two 500 MW generators were added and became operational in 2014 and 2015, giving a total generating capacity of 2,805 MW.<br \/>\nThe Mica powerhouse delivers its power to Nicola\u00a0Substation\u00a0via a 500-kilovolt, 570-kilometre (350\u00a0mi) transmission line. A second\u00a0power transmission line\u00a0was built to the Meridian Substation near\u00a0Port Moody, British Columbia, Canada.<br \/>\n<strong>Hugh Keenleyside Dam<\/strong>. At Castlegar, it is 52m (170&#8242;) high with a lock to permit small craft to utilize Arrow Lake. It backed up the Columbia River to Revelstoke, flooding the 32 km of river channel between Lower and Upper Arrow Lakes thus creating a lake 250 km (155 miles) long. It destroyed farms, summer homes and communities.<br \/>\n<strong>Revelstoke Dam.<\/strong> Later, BC Hydro built this massive 150 dm (500&#8242;) dam three miles north of Revelstoke. It backs up water upstream almost to Mica Dam.<\/p>\n<div id=\"inner-content\" class=\"row\">\n<section class=\"col-sm-9\">\n<div class=\"region region-content\">\n<section id=\"block-system-main\" class=\"block block-system clearfix\">\n<div id=\"node-1716\" class=\"node node-news clearfix\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\">\n<div class=\"field-items\">\n<div class=\"field-item even\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>FRED LAING RIDGE\u00a0 \u00a02147m\u00a0 7044&#8242; A spectacular ridge viewpoint down to the Big Bend of the Columbia River as it swings around the north end of the Selkirk Mountain Range.
