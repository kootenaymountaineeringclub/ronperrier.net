Ice on the Climb<\/strong>. The difficulty of ice climbs has not been estimated.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <strong>2. Glacier Travel<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Note that all routes with glacier travel are at least Class 4 (rope necessary), even if the climbing on the peak itself is Class 3 (a scramble). Bergschrunds are often met, and the ice problems associated with them are not always stated as \u201cIce\u201d in the text.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <strong>3. Duration<\/strong>. The third rating is that of the duration, of the round trip, in other words, the overall commitment to the climb. It is an attempt to estimate the length of the climb in time, which depends on distance (Distant base camps require more time). Elevation gain, the degree of sustained difficulty, the physical condition of the party, its efficient or inefficient use of time, and conditions on the mountain. Such ratings are always approximate. In Roman numerals,<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <em>Grade I<\/em> means a climb requiring a few hours.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <em>Grade II<\/em> &#8211; half a day.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <em>Grade III<\/em> most of the day.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <em>Grade IV<\/em> very long day, maybe with a bivouac.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <em>Grade V,<\/em> one to two days.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <em>Grade VI<\/em> &#8211; several days.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <strong>4. Rock Climbing<\/strong>. The fourth rating is that of difficulty of the rock climbing, by the decimal system (omitted in pure snow and ice climbs). The table gives comparisons of two systems.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <strong>NCCS Decimal Adjective<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> F1 A walk<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> F2 Steep walk<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> F3 Scrambling<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> F3 4 Rope necessary (including glaciers)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> 5.0 Possible protection<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> F4 5.1 Moderately<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> 5.2 difficult<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> F5 5.3 Difficult<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> F6 5.6 Very difficult<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> F7 5.7<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> F8 5.8<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> F9 5.9 Extremely<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> F10 5.10 difficult<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> These ratings are not of sustained difficulty, but of the hardest move.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <strong>5. Artificial Aid<\/strong>. The fifth rating, artificial aid, is from A1 to A4 when present. A0 indicates a rappel or a pendulum.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <strong>6. Snow<\/strong>. The sixth rating is whether snow is expected on the climb(s). Ascents over glaciers always have this. The presence of snow, of course, depends mainly on the season. Many climbs on snow require crampons even when the ice is not present.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <strong>7. Pleasing Nature of the Climb<\/strong>. The seventh rating is a measure of the overall pleasing nature of the climb, admittedly a question of opinion. This may be due, for instance, to sustained difficulty on sound rock, to fine snow climbing or to beautiful surroundings. It is given by one or two stars (*), two stars denoting an outstanding climb. The use of these has been sparing, but because the author cannot do all the routes, and because people\u2019s opinions are subjective or were not sought, some routes may deserve one or two stars, but do not bear them. Future experience will tell.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> In some cases where descriptions were terse and incomplete, some guesswork has been used to estimate difficulties and lengths of climbs. Accuracy in all details in such a work as this is impossible, and when faced by guidebook inaccuracy, one should use one&#8217;s experience and common sense to reach a sound decision, and not rely on rote adherence to the guidebook.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Ratings, Snowfall, Glacial Retreat and Advance<br \/>\n<\/strong>Ratings give only limited information; therefore, it is best to read the entire description before deciding whether to climb. This guidebook assumes a climbing party to be adequately equipped, in condition, and to have sound judgment and good weather. Often, a general geological description of a group is given, which may help the climber to judge rock solidity. It will be found in the introduction, or the introduction to each group, and sometimes as comments.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Snowfall is not constant from year to year, nor are snow conditions during stormy versus clear summers. Many routes are dependent on snow depth and cover. The descriptions in the text are hopefully typical. With different amounts of snow, the routes may vary significantly in difficulty and danger.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Since 1857 (see book, \u2019The Forms of Water\u2019), there has been an average warming trend in the world climate, and the glaciers in the Columbia Mountains have significantly retreated since that time. At Glacier, the great Illecillewaet Glacier (for which the area was named) used to extend to a point not far from the old railroad roadbed at Glacier House, and was a tourist attraction. The tongue of the glacier has retreated several kilometres. It is more than 700 meters higher today, a dramatic retreat lasting about a century and leaving moraines and bare quartzite slabs behind it.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> All the glaciers of these mountains have behaved similarly. However, not all so dramatically, and only on the more shadowed slopes under the highest peaks do glaciers persist in strength, or in areas like ice fields where the provenance of winter snow is excellent. The melting of ice has modified some routes of access, and changes are continuing today. This retreat began earlier in the Alps, in 1857 (see John Tyndall\u2019s book).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Not all the glaciers are retreating. During the period 1977-1991, the Illecillewaet Glacier had advanced an average of six meters per year, and an ice cliff had replaced a smoothly sloping glacier toe. A study in 1985 showed that 422 glaciers in Glacier National Park were enlarging and that there were 68 new \u2018baby\u2019 glaciers.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Glacier Travel &#8211; Increased familiarity with and travel on glaciers in the Columbia Mountains in the last few decades has unfortunately developed a disregard for the dangers of glacier travel among many climbers and has led to a neglect of protection against falls into crevasses.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> In the old days when the region was being prospected for minerals, the prospectors were afraid of the glaciers, and with good reason. When crossing a snow-covered glacier alone, they sometimes tied a rope around the waist and dragged a long pole behind, hoping that the pole would span the hole if they fell into a crevasse. Modern lone travellers would profit from their experience, if not their technique.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> To quote Don Munday, \u201cSome mountaineering writers convey the impression that surface signs always mark the presence of a crevasse roofed thinly enough to be dangerous. This is bad advice, and likely to lull the less experienced person into a false sense of security.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>YOSEMITE DECIMAL SYSTEM (YDS)<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Introduced by the Sierra Club in 1937, climbs are rated by their most difficult (crux) move, and by the length of commitment needed to complete a climb (the grade).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong> Class 1<\/strong>: Hiking. There is a trail (or pseudo-trail) the entire way to the summit.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong> Class 2<\/strong>: Off-Trail Scrambling. These routes are more rugged, and although you can walk to the summit, you may occasionally have to use your <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">hands to climb.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong> Class 3<\/strong>. Climbing. These routes involve actual climbing.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong> Class 4<\/strong>. Climbing with exposure. Belayed climbing. These routes involve climbing, which may be no more difficult than Class 3 climbing, but do subject the climber to increased exposure.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong> Class 5<\/strong>. Belayed climbing with the leader placing protection. This is &#8220;technical rock climbing, pure and simple.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong> Class 6<\/strong>. Involves artificial aid climbing, which utilizes pitons, bolts or any other hardware placed in the rock to serve as a hold or for support.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>BUSHWHACKING RATING SYSTEM<\/strong><br \/>\nDifficulty ratings apply to those areas of the brush that can&#8217;t be avoided.<br \/>\n<strong>BW1 Light Brush.<\/strong> Travel mostly unimpeded, only occasional use of hands required (e.g. mature open forest)<br \/>\n<strong>BW2 Moderate Brush<\/strong>. Occasional heavy patches. Pace slowed, frequent use of hands required.<br \/>\n<strong>BW3 Heavy brush<\/strong>. Hands are needed constantly. Some loss of blood may occur due to scratches and cuts. Travel is noticeably hindered. Use of four-letter words at times.<br \/>\n<strong>BW4 Severe brush.<\/strong> Pace less than one mile per hour. Leather gloves and heavy clothing are required to prevent bleeding, much profanity and mental anguish. Thick stands of brush requiring circumnavigation are encountered.<br \/>\n<strong>BW5 Extreme brush.<\/strong> It takes multiple hours to travel one mile. Full body armour is desirable. Wounds to extremities are likely; eye protection is needed, and footing difficulty due to a lack of visibility. Loss of temper is inevitable. (Mt Thor in the Gold Range ranks as one of the most difficult bushwhacks imaginable).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Rating systems are designed to inform readers of the difficulty.
