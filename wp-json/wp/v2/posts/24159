On a recent trip to the grocery store, I picked up a pack of boneless thighs that cost, pound for pound, some 50 cents more than boneless breasts. In fact, the cost of thighs has crept steadily upward for years now, and surpassed that of breasts for much of last year. In recent months, breasts have gained in price again, but white meat\u2019s continued dominance no longer seems assured. Home cooks have embraced the flavor and versatility of dark meat; fast-casual restaurants such as Chipotle and Sweetgreen have it all over their menus. After a decades-long run, America\u2019s white-meat era may finally be ending.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">That era began in the1980s, when the first plant dedicated to deboned breast meat opened in the United States. \u201cBefore that, deboned breast meat was very expensive and rare,\u201d Paul Aho, a poultry-industry consultant, told me. Eating chicken used to mean getting whole chickens, skin and bones and all. But when processing plants started atomizing chicken into their parts, the popularity of boneless, skinless breasts exploded. Americans learned to love not only slabs of white meat but also nuggets, patties, and tenders\u2014processed products made possible by the ubiquity of deboned breasts. In an era obsessed with low-fat, low-cholesterol diets, white meat was deemed the healthier option too. Demand for breasts drove the expansion of the entire American poultry industry, Aho said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The billions of chickens being raised for breast meat of course also have billions of thighs, legs, wings, and organs, arguably by-products of breast production. U.S. producers learned to export minimally processed leg quarters\u2014an entire thigh and leg with skin and bones\u2014overseas, where consumers did not mind, or even preferred, dark meat. Russia was a major customer, then China, and then Mexico.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The boneless and skinless chicken thigh, however, did not exist as a widespread meat product in the United States\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/opinion\/articles\/2021-05-13\/chicken-breasts-still-beat-dark-meat-on-american-dinner-plates\" data-event-element=\"inline link\" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899=\"90729965\" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899=\"100\" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899=\"1\">until the 2000s<\/a>. This is also partially a story of industrial innovation: Over time, the thigh-deboning process has become more automated, making boneless dark meat less labor-intensive to produce. The Baader 632 Thigh Filleting System, for example, boasts of processing\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.meatpoultry.com\/articles\/22895-poultry-processing-tech-the-art-of-deboning\" data-event-element=\"inline link\" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899=\"90732901\" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899=\"100\" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899=\"1\">230 thighs a minute<\/a>, by yanking the meat straight off the bone. Aho points out that automation tends to work better with thighs, which have only a single straight bone, than with breasts, which cling to multiple curved bones. Machines that debone breasts usually can\u2019t get the muscle off as cleanly, leaving more meat behind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">With the rise of the boneless thigh, American chicken producers saw an opportunity to sell dark meat at home, at prices higher than intact thighs can get overseas. They started producing more deboned thighs. In 2019, the chicken producer Sanderson Farms\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/business\/story\/2019-07-18\/dark-meat-chicken-popularity-grows-breeders-aim-for-smaller-breasts\" data-event-element=\"inline link\" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899=\"90754484\" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899=\"100\" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899=\"1\">told the\u00a0<em>Los Angeles Times<\/em><\/a> that it would soon have thigh-deboning capacity at all seven of its plants for large birds, compared with just one or two a couple of years earlier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">If a fully intact thigh is unmistakably a thigh, the boneless, skinless version is more approachable for Americans raised on similarly processed breasts. Deboned thighs are just as easy to throw on a grill, put in a sandwich, shred, or chop into bite-size pieces for burritos. In fact, they\u2019re easier to cook than breasts, because they\u2019re less prone to drying out from being left in the pan for five minutes too long. Recipe developers optimizing for easy and quick can tout their \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/09\/24\/dining\/weeknight-chicken-thigh-recipe.html\" data-event-element=\"inline link\" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899=\"90785279\" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899=\"100\" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899=\"1\">mass appeal<\/a>.\u201d \u201cI certainly see a lot more praise of dark meat than there used to be,\u201d J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt, the food writer and cookbook author, told me. (He personally prefers a perfectly cooked chicken breast, but said it\u2019s hard to get right.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Matt Busardo, who heads up North American poultry for the market-intelligence firm Expana, points to two other reasons for the popularity of thighs: the diversification of the American palate, thanks to the popularity of Asian and Latin American cuisines that prize dark meat, and the rise of fast-casual restaurants, which considered thighs a tastier, more forgiving, and until recently cheaper cut. Chicken breasts are still popular; their sales have been rising this whole time, too. But \u201cthigh meat has kind of overshot that by leaps and bounds,\u201d Busardo told me. Sales of chicken breast by volume are up 3.9 percent in the past three years, but sales of thighs are up 15.9 percent, according to the marketing-research firm Circana.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The historically single-minded focus on breeding chickens for white meat has, ironically, made it less appealing in some ways. Anecdotally, I\u2019ve heard of shoppers put off by woody breast or spaghetti meat\u2014muscle disorders that result from the breast growing too big too fast. Chicken breasts have nearly doubled in size since the 1950s, and these muscle irregularities became common enough to worry the industry\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/articles\/PMC7419734\/pdf\/skaa207.pdf\" data-event-element=\"inline link\" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899=\"90843575\" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899=\"100\" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899=\"1\">about 20 years ago<\/a>. Woody breast causes an unappetizing, almost crunchy texture; spaghetti meat comes out mushy and stringy. Tinkering with diets to slow growth or slaughtering birds at lower weights can mitigate woody breast, Casey Owens, a poultry scientist at the University of Arkansas, told me. But a small, slower-growing chicken is a less profitable chicken. Owens has also studied how to make woody breasts more palatable through extra processing. When ground up into patties, she said, the extra connective tissue found in woody breasts makes for a less dense, maybe even preferable, texture.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">If the demand for dark meat continues to rise, chickens selected for their big breasts may no longer be economically optimal. Could the industry start breeding birds with bigger thighs? \u201cI\u2019ve actually brought that up to breeding companies, and 10 or 15 years ago, they would just scoff at the idea,\u201d Aho said. \u201cNow they say, \u2018We might need a more balanced bird.\u2019\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<div data-event-module=\"footer\">\n<div class=\"ArticleWell_root__fueCa\">\n<div class=\"ArticleFooter_authorFooter__5NsdY\" data-event-module=\"author footer\">\n<div class=\"SectionHeading_root__3GnqT\">\n<h3 class=\"SectionHeading_heading__iNkek\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">About the Author<\/span><\/h3>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"ArticleBio_root__ua8zj\">\n<address id=\"article-writer-0\" class=\"ArticleBio_author__6pDyl\" data-event-element=\"author\" data-event-position=\"1\">\n<div class=\"ArticleBio_content__O0ZVF\">\n<div class=\"ArticleBio_topContainer__QYRU4\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a class=\"ArticleBio_headshotContainer__Am2nR\" href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/author\/sarah-zhang\/\" data-event-element=\"image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"Image_root__XxsOp Image_lazy__hYWHV Image_loaded__zmzJ7 ArticleBio_headshot__6Aykd\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.theatlantic.com\/thumbor\/WEhXN4sTyIcsmQLhbQC3MPotwqQ=\/1064x0:3850x2786\/120x120\/media\/None\/IMG_9300_copy\/original.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" \/><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<div>\n<div class=\"ArticleBio_bioNameMulti__gvg_b\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/author\/sarah-zhang\/\" data-event-element=\"author name\">Sarah Zhang<\/a><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/address>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The End of Chicken-Breast Dominance The price of boneless chicken thighs is finally catching up with the price of white meat.
