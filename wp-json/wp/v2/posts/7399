Now, the approaches to Whitewater Mountain and Mount Brennan (and Lyle Peak) are separate. The road toward Lyle Creek and Mount Brennan (the Rossiter Creek Forest Service Road) is east of the Whitewater Mountain Road and Retallack.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">In 1944, Lyle Peak was approached up the Mount Brennan road, crossing a bridge over Lyle Creek, and hiking up switchbacks of an old road on the east side of Lyle Creek. This bridge no longer exists. Another way is to hike the Mount Brennan trail near the lakes and the west side of the mountain. The start of the old Mount Brennan road is now closed (private property).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Rossiter Creek Forest Service Road\u00a0<\/strong>(23.2 km, 14.4 miles, midway between New Denver and Kaslo).

The road crosses Rossiter Creek and climbs the face between Rossiter and Lyle Creeks.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">7.2 km In a clearcut and just past a right switchback, an old mine road enters from the left (west; see above). This is the lower of two old roads entering from the west, 100 meters below a road junction. This road leads 0.8 km down to Lyle Creek. If you have a small four-wheel drive vehicle, it is drivable to the creek; otherwise, park at the switchback and walk.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">8.0km Trail Head. 1433m (4700&#8242;)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Trail:<\/strong> The old bridge is washed out but a new footbridge exists. Lyle Creek appears to be fordable on foot from about mid-August. The path joins the old access road on the west side of the creek (hanging cable above the old parking space); 300 meters farther to the Mount Brennan trailhead. The tramway cable above serviced the mines above. The old mining road provides access for about 250m until the trail can be plainly seen.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The trail, usually kept brushed out by the BC Forest Service, switchbacks up for approximately 450m (1500&#8242;) before cresting a plateau and the upper cirque of the Lyle Creek basin 2012 (6600&#8242;). This subalpine area with its three glacial tarns is a perfect spot for a well-deserved rest.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">From here the &#8220;little maintained&#8221; trail climbs steadily up the creek and the east side of Mt Brennan until it fades out on the rock ridge 350m (1148&#8242;) above. There are interesting abandoned mining shafts along a mineral seam. Scramble up the ridge to the summit. There is a year-round snow field here so new and old snow or ice along the ridge can be dangerous underfoot.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">From the summit of Mt Brennan, the West Kootenay and Purcells to the east stretch out in a panorama of jagged peaks and glaciers and you&#8217;ll need a full range of topographic maps to identify the many high points. Binoculars are handy here, particularly for sighting the mountain goats that roam these ridges and cliffs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\"><strong>Hiking Through History: Lyle Creek to Mount Brennan<\/strong> By A. Terry Turner <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">I\u2019ve always been fascinated with the history of old mining sites, trails and abandoned cabins. Unfortunately, there seems to be an absence of this sort of information in most of the hiking books I\u2019ve examined. When I brought this to the attention of an author, the abrupt answer was, \u201cHistory is boring\u201d. During research for a local history book a couple of years ago, I found an interesting reference to one of my favourite hiking areas, the Lyle Creek basin. More recently, this led to an exhaustive research project on the area. Anyway, here is a summary of one of the \u201cboring\u201d trails that I\u2019m sure many members of the KMC have trekked on over the years. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The Ibex crown granted mineral claim is located about 5 kilometres north of the ghost town of Retallack between Kaslo and New Denver. The Lyle Creek basin-Mount Brennan trail passes through this claim. The claim was located on August 8, 1891, by William Brennard and James Pringle. The owners explored a narrow high-grade vein of lead and silver over the next few years. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">In 1896 Frederick Steele represented Samuel B. Steele and others in the purchase of the Ibex property. Frederick Steele was a photographer from Winnipeg who took literally hundreds of photographs of people and places in southern Alberta and British Columbia. Samuel Benfield Steele, with the Northwest Mounted Police in MacLeod Alberta, is best known for his involvement in the Klondike Gold Rush and the founding of Fort Steele. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">The Ibex Mining and Development Company was incorporated to explore the lead-silver deposits in this area. Sam Steele was the President and Fred Steele was the Treasurer. The company\u2019s Secretary was David King, the publisher of the Kootenaian newspaper. Mr. King was responsible for keeping the public informed about the exciting events while Fred travelled between Kaslo and Winnipeg to promote and sell company stock. Large samples of massive galena (lead-silver ore) were commonly displayed in Whitewater (later Retallack) and Kaslo to attract investors. Before the winter of 1896, a proper access trail and two cabins were constructed. The narrow vein of high-grade lead-silver was mined by open-cut and underground methods. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">In January 1897, a massive avalanche swept down the steep slopes of Mount Brennan and killed a miner Jim Gillis while his son worked underground in the mine. Gillis\u2019 body was found in a small lake in the basin the following June. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">During the summer, seven packhorses carried 300-pound sacks to the company\u2019s ore storage hose in Whitewater prior to shipment to a smelter in Pueblo, Colorado. Without notice, the financial status of the company deteriorated and by early November the Supreme Court appointed a liquidator to sell the assets and pay off the creditors. Reasons for the company\u2019s collapse include the fluctuating price of silver, high transportation costs and adverse mining conditions. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;\">Very limited work has ever been carried out on this property since but the claim is still held by Art Bennett, a prospector from Kaslo. Today, there is little to remind us of this historical mining venture except the rusting cans, the cabin remains and the three amazing photographs taken by Frederick Steele in 1896. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Most West Kootenay valleys are deep and narrow and views are restricted to rounded, forested slopes.
