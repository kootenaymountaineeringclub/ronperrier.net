But nuts tend to steal the limelight, while edible seeds are often overlooked as ingredients to feature in everyday meals.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSeeds are kind of like the poor stepchild\u2014they don\u2019t get a lot of love or attention,\u201d says Keith Ayoob, a registered dietitian-nutritionist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in The Bronx. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to find them on supermarket shelves and people aren\u2019t as familiar with them.\u201d What\u2019s more, edible seeds \u201care often not assessed in clinical and epidemiological studies,\u201d according to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/advances\/article\/13\/4\/1016\/6554239\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">research in a 2022 issue of\u00a0<i>Advances in Nutrition<\/i><\/a>. That means their health benefits don\u2019t garner headlines.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s unfortunate because seeds are nutritional powerhouses in their own right. They\u2019re all good sources of protein, fiber, healthy fats, and antioxidants but different edible seeds vary in their macro- and micronutrient content. For example, a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nepjol.info\/index.php\/AJMS\/article\/view\/33792\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study in a 2021 issue of the\u00a0<i>Asian Journal of Medical Sciences<\/i><\/a><i>\u00a0<\/i>compared the nutrients in five different seeds: The researchers found that sunflower seeds have the highest protein and fat content, whereas pumpkin seeds have the highest moisture content as well as higher amounts of potassium\u2014and watermelon seeds have the greatest amount of calcium (<i>who knew?!<\/i>).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSeeds and eggs are similar in that they both contain stored nutrients that can later form a future plant\u2014or animal in the case of eggs,\u201d notes Janet Colson, a registered dietitian and director of the nutrition and food science program at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro. \u201cThe stored nutrients are very concentrated because seeds contain very little water. They pack a lot of nutrients into a very small space.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a closer look at how seven seeds compare nutritionally, with ideas for how to incorporate them into your meals:<\/p>\n<h2>Chia seeds<\/h2>\n<p>Small but mighty,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.eatright.org\/food\/food-groups\/fats\/what-are-chia-seeds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">chia seeds<\/a>\u00a0are believed to have originated in Central America where they were an integral part of the ancient Aztec diet.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hsph.harvard.edu\/nutritionsource\/food-features\/chia-seeds\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">They serve up a hefty dose of<\/a> protein, unsaturated fats, calcium, and zinc, as well as lots of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, a plant-based omega-3 fatty acid) and fiber. \u201cChia seeds are high in soluble and insoluble fiber, which helps reduce high blood pressure and cholesterol,\u201d says Wendy Bazilian, a nutritionist and public health consultant based in San Diego. \u201cThey pull in up to 12 times their weight in water\u2014that\u2019s why they\u2019re good for making chia pudding.\u201d Alternatively, you can sprinkle the seeds on salads, yogurt, or cereal, or blend them into smoothies, salad dressings, or batter for muffins or bread.<\/p>\n<h2>Flaxseeds<\/h2>\n<p>These tiny seeds have been\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.herbalgram.org\/resources\/herbalgram\/issues\/45\/table-of-contents\/article766\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">consumed in various forms for more than 5,000<\/a>\u00a0years. Traditionally used as flaxseed oil in Egyptian cuisine,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/fdc.nal.usda.gov\/fdc-app.html#\/food-details\/2262075\/nutrients\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">flaxseeds are filled with<\/a>\u00a0fiber, and they\u2019re good sources of protein, calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, selenium, folate, and vitamin K. They also contain ALA and antioxidants such as lutein and zeaxanthin, which are good for vision, notes Bazilian, author of the\u00a0<i>Eat Clean, Stay Lean\u00a0<\/i>series. The hitch: \u201cFlaxseeds have a husk that the human digestive system will not process unless they\u2019re ground up,\u201d she says. Once they\u2019re ground, they look like wheat germ and can be added to smoothies, oatmeal, plant-based burger, and other foods, adding a dash of earthy flavor and a bit of crunch.<\/p>\n<h2>Hemp seeds<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ers.usda.gov\/webdocs\/publications\/41740\/15853_ages001ec_1_.pdf?v=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Originally from central Asia<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/fdc.nal.usda.gov\/fdc-app.html#\/food-details\/170148\/nutrients\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hemp seeds<\/a>\u00a0are having a moment because of their association with marijuana but these edible seeds won\u2019t get you high, Bazilian says. But they could give your health a boost because they\u2019re high in protein, as well as potassium, iron, magnesium, manganese, zinc, and folate, as well as ALA. They are softer in texture than most seeds, which means you can snack on them anytime (they often come shelled). They also can be used in smoothie bowls, grain, bean, or rice dishes, muffins, cereals, or pancakes.<\/p>\n<h2>Poppy seeds<\/h2>\n<p>People often don\u2019t think about poppy seeds unless they\u2019re baked into bagels, breads, rolls, or muffins. That\u2019s unfortunate because these little black seeds are versatile\u2014you can add them to hot cereal, soups, casseroles, or dressings. They\u2019re loaded with protein, fiber, calcium, magnesium, potassium, zinc, selenium, vitamin E,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/fdc.nal.usda.gov\/fdc-app.html#\/food-details\/171330\/nutrients\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">and other nutrients<\/a>. Keep in mind: \u201cPoppy seeds contain chemicals that certain drug tests will pick up as similar to drugs that are being looked for,\u201d Ayoob says. In fact, the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/media.defense.gov\/2023\/Feb\/21\/2003164614\/-1\/-1\/1\/POPPY-SEEDS-WARNING-MEMO-SIGNED-CONTACT-REDACTED.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">U.S. Department of Defense issued a warning in February 2023<\/a> to military service members to avoid consuming poppy seeds for this reason.<\/p>\n<h2>Pumpkin seeds<\/h2>\n<p>Not only are they protein powerhouses\u2014with 20 grams in approximately \u00bd cup\u2014but pumpkin seeds (a.k.a., pepitas), which\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.universityofcalifornia.edu\/news\/10-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-pumpkins\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">originated in Mexico<\/a>\u00a0many thousands of years ago, also\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/fdc.nal.usda.gov\/fdc-app.html#\/food-details\/2515380\/nutrients\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contain fiber, iron, magnesium, potassium, zinc, and selenium<\/a>. These larger, olive-colored seeds have a pleasant crunch, which makes them great for snacking. \u201cThey have a personality,\u201d says Bazilian, who recommends putting them in a homemade trail mix or sprinkling them on butternut squash soup or yogurt or using them in breading for fish or chicken. You can also roast fresh pumpkin seeds with different spices, such as paprika or turmeric, suggests Dolores Woods, a registered dietitian and nutrition supervisor for the Nourish Program at the UT Health Houston School of Public Health.<\/p>\n<h2>Sesame seeds<\/h2>\n<p>Used to make tahini, a Mediterranean condiment,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/fdc.nal.usda.gov\/fdc-app.html#\/food-details\/170151\/nutrients\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sesame seeds are a good source of<\/a>\u00a0protein, fiber, calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, zinc, selenium, ALA, and antioxidants. Their nutty flavor\u2014toasting or roasting them really brings it out\u2014is well suited to marinades, stir fries, or rice dishes; black sesame seeds can be used as breading for fish or poultry. \u201cA pro tip: Measure them over the sink because if you spill them, you\u2019ll never stop finding them,\u201d Ayoob says. A note of caution: Some people are allergic to sesame seeds, which is why in\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/consumers\/consumer-updates\/allergic-sesame-food-labels-now-must-list-sesame-allergen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">January 2023 the Food and Drug Administration<\/a>\u00a0began requiring manufacturers of packaged foods to label sesame as an allergen on products that contain it.<\/p>\n<h2>Sunflower seeds<\/h2>\n<p>A good source of fiber and protein,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/fdc.nal.usda.gov\/fdc-app.html#\/food-details\/2515381\/nutrients\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sunflower seeds also contain<\/a> iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, zinc, and selenium, among other micronutrients. They\u2019re also a rich source of vitamin E and folate, Bazilian notes. For a bit of crunch and a nutty flavor, you can add the shelled seeds to yogurt, oatmeal, or salads. They also come prepacked on their own or in trail mixes, as a snack. \u201cA lot of people eat them salted,\u201d Woods says. \u201cIt\u2019s better to opt for unsalted if you\u2019re watching your salt intake.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Because of their healthy-fat content, these seeds can spoil more quickly than you might expect. Ayoob suggests, \u201cif you\u2019re not going to use them right away, put them in the refrigerator or even the freezer,\u201d to prolong their shelf life.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/article>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You may be overlooking this nutritional powerhouse.
