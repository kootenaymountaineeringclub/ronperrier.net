Enter at the Siq and visit all the big sites: Museum at the entrance, Treasury, High Place of Sacrifices, Street of Facades, Theatre, Blue Church, Great Temple, Temple of the Winged Lions, Qasr al-Bint, Al-Habis (the prison), Crusader fort, Lion Tomb, Monastery and the great viewpoints beyond the Monastery.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><br \/>\nDay 2<\/span> I had three great hikes on my second day at Petra. This was one of the best travel\/hiking days of my life. It was hard to fit them all in and a three-day Petra pass made more sense.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><br \/>\nWADI MUTHLIM<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">This adventurous scramble is an exciting alternative route into Petra if you\u2019ve already taken the main path through the Siq. The hike is not difficult or strenuous, but there are several places where you\u2019ll need to lower yourself down pour-offs. Don\u2019t attempt the hike if it has been raining or is likely to rain. As there was a fatality on this route, a guide is now required and the police stop you from entering from the top. I wasn\u2019t stopped. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The trail starts at the dam just to the right of the entrance to the Siq. You almost immediately go through a short tunnel (Nabataean Tunnel). Walk down the rocky creek bed. Some spots have stupendous sandstone \u2013 dark red layers alternating with tan-coloured rock. The lower end slots up with some nice narrow, twisty bits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" nofocus\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https:\/\/www.globespots.com\/pictures\/gallery\/petra\/petra_7.jpg\" alt=\"Petra | Travel Pictures\" width=\"620\" height=\"413\" aria-label=\"Petra | Travel Pictures\" data-bm=\"6\" \/><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" nofocus\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https:\/\/www.globespots.com\/pictures\/gallery\/petra\/petra_8.jpg\" alt=\"Petra | Travel Pictures\" width=\"619\" height=\"412\" aria-label=\"Petra | Travel Pictures\" data-bm=\"6\" \/><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The canyon ends about a kilometre from the Royal Tombs. On the walk back, you pass many rock-cut tombs. A good trail runs just along the south side of the wadi. If the police don\u2019t allow you to walk down the wadi at the top, plan on returning from Petra this way. It is well worth it.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><br \/>\nAL-KHUBTHA TRAIL<\/strong>\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Before you reach the Royal Tombs from Wadi Muthlim, this \u201ctrail\u201d goes up a side canyon to the south. It is a long steep climb up a gorgeous (mostly) rock-cut stairway cut into the cliff face. The first viewpoint gives a hint of the incredible views up ahead. Before the last short bit of stairs is a bench perched at the edge of a 1000-foot drop. The view is of the entire centre of Petra with the theatre to the left and good views down toward the Great Temple and the start of the trail to the Monastery.<br \/>\nThose last stairs bring you to the top of the cliffs above the Royal Tombs. Walk in front of a small \u201chouse\u201d rock-cut into a rock bump right at the top, descend a small cliff and walk south along a dirt trail. This eventually leads to a Bedouin home perched on the edge immediately above the Treasury. The views are unbelievably nice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" nofocus\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https:\/\/thumbs.dreamstime.com\/b\/stairway-al-khubtha-trail-ancient-city-petra-jord-jordan-187533600.jpg\" alt=\"Stairway at Al Khubtha Trail in the Ancient City Petra, Jord Stock Photo - Image of architecture ...\" width=\"618\" height=\"413\" aria-label=\"Stairway at Al Khubtha Trail in the Ancient City Petra, Jord Stock Photo - Image of architecture ...\" \/><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" nofocus\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https:\/\/www.lkedzierski.com\/photos\/2020\/01\/petra-al-khubtha-trail-skarbiec-faraona-1020x680.jpg\" alt=\"Petra - szlak Al-Khubtha Trail z pi\u0119knym widokiem na Skarbiec Faraona\" width=\"617\" height=\"412\" aria-label=\"Petra - szlak Al-Khubtha Trail z pi\u0119knym widokiem na Skarbiec Faraona\" data-bm=\"6\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Return the way you came as there is no way down the vertical cliffs. There were a lot of goats at the top. Don\u2019t miss this one.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">If planning on doing the Mount Aaron hike, take the time at the top of the Al-Khubtha viewpoints to follow the road that is the first part of the route.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>JEBAL HARUM &#8220;Mount Aaron&#8221;<\/strong> (1270m)<br \/>\nAaron was Moses\u2019 brother and his tomb is in a sanctuary on the summit of this mountain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" nofocus\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https:\/\/www.womeninthebible.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/mont_haroun.jpg\" alt=\"Aaron | biblelegends\" width=\"622\" height=\"410\" aria-label=\"Aaron | biblelegends\" data-bm=\"6\" \/><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" nofocus\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" src=\"https:\/\/alchetron.com\/cdn\/tomb-of-aaron-a231bb1c-dd1a-4dda-8d70-b2a659d484d-resize-750.jpeg\" alt=\"Tomb of Aaron - Alchetron, The Free Social Encyclopedia\" width=\"621\" height=\"466\" aria-label=\"Tomb of Aaron - Alchetron, The Free Social Encyclopedia\" data-bm=\"6\" \/><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><br \/>\nWalk a few hundred meters past the Theatre and take a rocky trail to the left. This eventually hits a dirt road that passes just above the Great Temple.<br \/>\nThe first landmark is \u2018Amud Fir\u2019awn or the Pharaoh\u2019s Column. This is the solitary column of a ruined sanctuary (on the route to Egypt via Naqa al-Rubai). Just after the column, take the right fork and cross a large wadi (Wadi Ras Suleiman). Continue past several rock-cut tombs and many Bedouin homes to reach a shoulder for the first view of your destination, Jebal Harun with the white tomb of Aaron on top.<br \/>\nScan the south flank of the mountain to see the faint white zig-zagging trail. Cross two tributaries of the headwaters of another large wadi. At the high point after the first tributary, leave this main road and take a faint track heading west. Scan ahead to the right of the wadi to see the beginning of the trail that winds along the bottom of a hill. Cross the upper end of the wadi, pass in front of a small block building and head up aiming for the start of the trail. The trail is easy to follow to the top of the mountain. Most is slick rock cleared of rocks. When on top of the cliff below the summit block, walk along the west side to the stairway on the north side of the mountain that ascends the cliff face: back to Wadi Musa and for hundreds of miles to the west and north. Climb the narrow stairs on the NW of the tomb to get onto the roof. Descend the way you came.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">It took me 2 1\/2 hours from just past the Theatre to the summit. On the flank of the mountain, I met a young Bedouin couple with a baby on a donkey. He offered a donkey for 20JD for the remaining hour to the top. I was only interested in walking. As the \u201ckeeper of the keys\u201d to the tomb, he then offered to use the key to enter the tomb for 10JD. He discounted the view as being of any importance. We were miles apart on price.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Other Hikes.<\/strong> There are numerous hikes into the hills and siqs around Petra. You need a guide for any hikes requiring overnight stops (it\u2019s not permitted to camp within Petra itself), but many other smaller trails can be easily hiked alone.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><em>Umm al-Biyara<\/em>. This is a steep hike up the imposing mountain whose sheer cliffs dominate Petra to the west. The steep, exciting route climbs 300m to 1160m at the top. Start as for Jebel Harun to Pharaoh\u2019s Column and cross the wadi. About 100m after crossing the wadi, go right 50m left of some stone tombs. Pass through a rocky defile into a little basin surrounded by caves, up diagonally past more caves then zigzag left and right to enter the gully at a new wall. Ascend the gully on ramps and reach steps, ledges and more steps to the top. On top is an Edomite settlement and Nabataean sites and cisterns.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Refer to the book \u201cJORDAN \u2013 Walks, Treks, Caves, Climbs and Canyons\u201d. Wadi Sabra looks interesting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>PETRA<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>History.<\/strong>\u00a0There is evidence of habitation 70,000 years ago, houses from the Neolithic period (8500-550BC), Bronze Age (3700-1200BC), Iron Age (the Edomites 1200-539BC), Babylonians (5th century BC) and then the first arrival of the Nabataeans in the 6th century BC. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The spectacular sandstone city of Petra was built in the 3rd century BC by the Nabataeans, nomadic Arabs from NW Saudi Arabia, who controlled the frankincense trade routes of the region in pre-Roman times. They carved palaces, temples, tombs, storerooms and stables from the sandstone cliffs. From here, they commanded the trade routes from Damascus to Arabia, and great spice, silk and slave caravans passed through, paying taxes and protection money. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Petra was at the centre of several trade routes: Egypt to the west, NW by the Mediterranean to Europe, north to the Levant and the Spice route from the east. Frankincense and myrrh (used as incense burned at temples, in burials, for embalming, sacrifices and rituals, it was expensive at the time, but wealthy Romans were willing to pay) were produced in present-day Oman and Yemen (in 100 BC, the Minaen Kingdom in Yemen collapsed and the Nabataeans took over), transported via 65 camel stages over 12 weeks to Petra and onto Gaza, a distance of 2750kms. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">They controlled rainwater by building 5 major aqueducts, cisterns and reservoirs, and using clay pipes and waterproof cement. In a short time, the Nabataeans made great advances \u2013 they mastered hydraulic engineering, intense agriculture, textile production, iron production, copper and silver refining, glass production, wine production (there were 40 rock-cut wine presses in the Petra area), sculpture and stone carving. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">There were 11 Nabataean kings until the last one died in 106 AD. They borrowed architectural ideas from Assyrians, Syrians (arches), Egyptians (obelisks), and Greco-Romans (pediments, capitals, triglyphs, and metopes), all identifiable in the rock-cut structures. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The structures were started at the top and worked down using metal chisels. All was covered with a thin layer of plaster, now mostly gone. The surfaces, corners, and roofs are perfectly done, flat and covered in fine chisel work. Their kingdom at its height supported 20,000 people. It extended from Damascus to NW Saudi Arabia, the Sinai and well past eastern Jordan.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The Romans occupied the area for 2 centuries followed by the Byzantines (324, converted the Monastery and Urn tombs into churches). An earthquake in 363 destroyed much of the water system aqueducts and crumbled the free-standing structures of the Qasr al Bint and the Great Temple. After a second earthquake in 551, the Byzantines moved to Karak. The Umayyads in the 7th century used it as a pilgrimage stop between Damascus and Mecca. The Abbasid Caliphate moved their capital to Baghdad in the 8th century. Crusaders built 3 fortresses here in the 11th century to obstruct pilgrimage routes but were eventually overcome by Saladdin.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">It was rediscovered by accident in 1812 by the Swiss explorer, Johan Burckhardt (the same chap who stumbled on the temple at Abu Simbel in Egypt). Until his momentous journey, disguised as an Arab, the neglected city, hidden deep in the rocky valleys of Wadi Musa, had escaped the attention of the Western world for hundreds of years. British explorers came in 1818, French artists in 1827 (the first to find the Monastery), the first American, John Steens in 1832, and the first woman, Charlotte Rowley in 1835. It was a star attraction in the 1989 Indian Jones movie, the Lost Crusade.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><br \/>\nA guide costs 50-70 JD (but all info is easily found in the museum and by reading). Avoid the horse ride after the entrance (it is free and included in the ticket, but you will be forced to pay a healthy tip). And be prepared for constant hassles from touts for donkey and camel rides. Bedouins sell trinkets throughout the site.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">You approach Petra through the legendary 1.2 km-long, high-sided <strong>Wadi Siq<\/strong>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/blaineharrington.photoshelter.com\/image\/I0000nGTUaImbJBs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwiahteyoM7fAhWCInwKHWnkBmsQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/ssl.c.photoshelter.com\/img-get\/I0000nGTUaImbJBs\/s\/850\/850\/20120116-israel-6638.jpg\" alt=\"Related image\" width=\"620\" height=\"413\" data-src=\"https:\/\/ssl.c.photoshelter.com\/img-get\/I0000nGTUaImbJBs\/s\/850\/850\/20120116-israel-6638.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><br \/>\nThis is not a canyon, but rather a rock mass that has been rent apart by tectonic forces. Just as you start to think there\u2019s no end to the Siq, you catch breathtaking glimpses ahead of the most impressive of Petra\u2019s sights, the <strong>Treasury<\/strong>, known locally as Al-Khazneh. 39.5m high, it was carved out of iron-laden sandstone to serve as a tomb to King Aretas IV (9BC-40AD). The Treasury gets its name from the misguided local belief that an Egyptian pharaoh hid his treasure in the top urn. The Greek-style pillars, winged griffins, vases, scrolls, alcoves and plinths are masterpieces of masonry work. In the centre is the goddess Isis surrounded by dancing Amazons.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/theplanetd.com\/petra-jordan-the-lost-city-by-day-photography\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwiBoMTcn87fAhXSwcQHHfcJBVoQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/theplanetd.com\/images\/petra-jordan-photos-treasury-1.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for Treasury petra\" width=\"623\" height=\"415\" data-src=\"https:\/\/theplanetd.com\/images\/petra-jordan-photos-treasury-1.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">From the Treasury, the way broadens into the Outer Siq, riddled with over 40 tombs known collectively as the <strong>Street of Facades<\/strong>.<br \/>\nJust before the theatre, <\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">notice a set of steps on the left. These ascend to the\u00a0<\/span><strong>High Place of Sacrifice<\/strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">, a hill-top altar. It is an easy but steep 45-minute climb. Descend on the other side of the mountain via the <\/span><strong>Garden Tomb, Roman Soldier\u2019s Tomb and Garden Triclinium<\/strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u00a0and follow your nose back to the Street of Facades, not far after the Theatre.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The weatherworn 7000-seat <\/span><strong style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Theatre<\/strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> is cut from one piece of stone. It was started by the Nabataeans and enlarged by the Romans,<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Almost opposite the Theatre is another set of steps that lead to a fine set of tomb facades cut into the cliffs above. These belong to the <strong>Royal Tombs.<\/strong> The tombs have some of the best carving in Petra. They give access to another of the city\u2019s mystic high places, a one-hour climb. Pass the <strong>Urn Tomb<\/strong>, with its arched portico. Look for stairs just after the three-storey <strong>Palace Tomb<\/strong>. If the tea vendor at the top is available, ask him to show you an aerial view of the Treasury. Return the way you came or search out a set of worn steps leading down a gully to the Urn Tomb.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Returning to the Theatre, the main path turns west along the colonnaded street, which was once lined with shops, passing the rubble of the nymphaeum en route to the elevated\u00a0<strong>Great Temple<\/strong> (a 7500-meter square boasting 60 columns) and the <strong>Temple of the Winged Lions<\/strong>\u00a0on the opposite side of the wadi.<br \/>\nAt the end of the colonnaded street, on the left, is the imposing main Nabataean temple known as\u00a0<strong>Qasr al-Bint<\/strong> \u2013 23m high and one of the few free-standing structures in Petra.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">From Qasr al-Bint, the path leads to\u00a0<em>restaurants<\/em>: (from their prices, it is a good idea to bring your lunch: lunch 10-17JD, drinks 2-4JD).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Behind the Nabataean Tent Restaurant is the small hill of\u00a0<strong>Al-Habis <\/strong>(the prison). A set of steps went up to Al-Habis Museum (now closed and all moved to the new museum at the entrance). From here you can take a path anticlockwise around the hill with fine views overlooking fertile Wadi Siyagh. Eventually, you will come to another set of steps to the top of a hill, the site of a ruined <strong>Crusader fort<\/strong>, built in AD 1116. The views across Petra are spectacular. Allow an hour to circumnavigate the hill and reach the fort.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Beside the Basin Restaurant is the opening to Wadi Siyagh and the start of the winding path that climbs to one of Petra\u2019s most beloved monuments, the\u00a0<strong>Monastery<\/strong>. Known locally as Al-Deir, the Monastery is reached by a rock-cut staircase (with 800 steps, it is a 45-minute walk to the top) and is best seen in the late afternoon when the sun draws out the colour of the sandstone. Built as a tomb around 86 BC, with its enormous facade, it was most probably used as a church in Byzantine times.<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><a class=\"irc_mil i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.lonelyplanet.com\/jordan\/petra\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwiPsu-Unc7fAhWBJ3wKHTsFDoMQjRx6BAgBEAU\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net\/a\/g\/hi\/t\/f27a1f10a618448d65e6ac16c9270e56-petra.jpg?sharp=10&amp;vib=20&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Image result for petra\" width=\"619\" height=\"383\" data-src=\"https:\/\/lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net\/a\/g\/hi\/t\/f27a1f10a618448d65e6ac16c9270e56-petra.jpg?sharp=10&amp;vib=20&amp;w=1200\" \/><\/a><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><br \/>\nSpare ten minutes to walk over to the two viewpoints on the nearby cliff tops.

I spent the day with a very pleasant 48-year-old German fellow. A teacher, he is here during his school\u2019s winter break for 2 weeks and is travelling by bicycle. We sat for a long time in front of the Royal Tombs. We also visited some ruins to the east of the Royal Tombs. The colour of the layered sandstone was amazing.<br \/>\nFrom the Monastery, there are 2 viewpoints to the west with tremendous views down to some very rugged mountains and the valley in the distance. There I met Mina Guli, a young Australian lawyer running 40 marathons in 7 deserts on 7 continents over 7 weeks to raise awareness for water, its scarcity and the need to conserve it. She runs 6 marathons over 6 days in each desert (Antarctica, Mohave in the USA, Simpson in Australia, Atacama in Chile, Karoo in South Africa, Tabernas in Spain, and Arabian in Jordan) and presumably has a travel day. Go to www.thirstforwater.org to see all the information. She was travelling with 4 young cinematographers filming the runs.<br \/>\nJordan is the second water-poorest country in the world.
