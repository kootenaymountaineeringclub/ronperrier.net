Some of the most famous include\u00a0Timgad\u00a0near\u00a0Batna,\u00a0Hippo Regius\u00a0at\u00a0Annaba,\u00a0Djemila\u00a0at\u00a0S\u00e9tif,\u00a0Calama\u00a0at\u00a0Guelma, and ruins from all three empires at\u00a0Tipasa.<br \/>\nWhile better known for the Roman ruins, Algeria&#8217;s greatest tourist possibilities lie in the\u00a0Sahara; there simply is no other country on earth that can offer the sort of exciting and exotic adventures around the great desert. The crown jewel is the centre of Mozabite culture in the\u00a0M&#8217;zab Valley. The five interconnected cities are a breathtaking architectural playground evocative of modern cubist and surrealist art. They simply must be seen in person. But the landscapes are impressive as well: the harsh, rugged\u00a0Saharan Atlas\u00a0mountains, the endless desert and Hoggar Mountains around the country&#8217;s desert capital of\u00a0Tamanrasset, the huge dune field of the Grand Erg Oriental at\u00a0El-Oued, and the ancient rock carvings of\u00a0Djelfa\u00a0and the Saharan National Park of\u00a0Tassili N&#8217;Ajjer.<br \/>\nThe Mediterranean\u00a0beaches\u00a0in Algeria are woefully underdeveloped, despite excellent potential, owing to the country&#8217;s poor security situation scaring off almost all tourists. But if you are in the country for a while, a bit of relaxation will at some point be in order, and there is no need to fly over to\u00a0Tunisia.\u00a0Oran\u00a0(urban) on the\u00a0Turquoise Coast,\u00a0Annaba, and particularly\u00a0Skikda\u00a0and\u00a0Ghazaouet\u00a0all have nice beaches. The spot to go near Algiers is undoubtedly the resort town of Sidi Fredj.<br \/>\nOf Algeria&#8217;s\u00a0major cities, you may be surprised at just how little of interest there is to see\u2014Algeria&#8217;s more exotic locales are a much bigger draw than its modern culture (stifled by conflict and abysmal government), Islamic heritage, and colonial legacy.\u00a0Algiers, the famed White City, is actually a much less touristic city than one might expect, given its central role in the country&#8217;s economic, political, and cultural life. But all visitors will pass through anyway, so the Casbah\u2014Algiers&#8217; historic seventeenth century center\u2014is certainly worth a visit. There are a few nice, more laid-back large cities in the\u00a0northwest, particularly the country&#8217;s second largest city of\u00a0Oran\u00a0and the historic city of\u00a0Tlemcen. In the\u00a0northeast,\u00a0Constantine\u00a0is the one major city that deserves a spot on your itinerary.

After the secession of\u00a0South Sudan\u00a0from\u00a0Sudan, Algeria became the largest country in Africa. Recent Algerian history has been marred by civil wars. That said, Algeria is gradually restoring order and will prove an interesting \u2014 if difficult \u2014 destination.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GET IN<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>By plane. <\/strong>Most major European airlines such as (Lufthansa, Air Berlin, British Airways, Air France, Iberia, Alitalia, TAP Portugal, Turkish Airlines) fly daily to Algiers but there are also some long-haul routes such as (Beijing, Montreal, Doha)<br \/>\nThere are good and relatively cheap direct flights from the UK e.g. BA from Gatwick. Flights as everywhere vary greatly in price according to when you go, but are typically \u00a3250 return in April or May.<br \/>\nFrom the United States the cheapest way to get into Algiers is via London (British Airways), Paris (Air France) or Frankfurt (Lufthansa).<br \/>\nThe national airline\u00a0Air Algerie\u00a0flies to many destinations in Europe especially France but also to some cities in Africa and the Middle East. All destinations served by Air Algerie from Algiers\u00a0: Abijan, Alicante, Bamako, Barcelona, Brussels, Basel, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Cairo, Casablanca, Dakar, Damascus, Dubai, Frankfurt, Geneva, Istanbul, London, Madrid, Milan, Montreal, Moscow, Niamey, Paris, Rome, Tripoli, Tunis.<br \/>\n<strong>By train. <\/strong>The Algerian train company is named\u00a0SNTF, tickets can be bought at the Train stations, unfortunately the website hasn&#8217;t been updated since 2008 and online booking is not possible any more, time tables are subject to change; the best way is to ask for information at the train station itself. The network in the north is dense. You can reach Algeria by train from Tunisia, although you will have to change the train at the border post. All border points with Morocco are currently closed.<br \/>\nIf you can try to catch the newer trains they are more comfortable and climate-controlled.<br \/>\n<strong>By car. <\/strong>The realistic and most secure way to reach Algeria by car is across the Tunisian border. The Mauritanian and Malian borders present some security problems, and the Moroccan border is closed. There are no problems if you want to get into Algeria from the Tunisian border posts in the north.<br \/>\n<strong>By boat. <\/strong>The prices are usually more expensive than flying so if you can and have no car take a plane. Most connections are offered by\u00a0Algerie Ferries.<br \/>\n<em>From\/to\u00a0Spain:\u00a0<\/em>Alicante to Algiers and Oran, Almeria to Gazhaouet, Barcelona to Algiers and Oran<br \/>\n<em>From\/to\u00a0France:\u00a0<\/em>Marseille to almost every Algerian harbour (Annaba, Skikda, Bejaia, Jijel, Algiers, Oran)<\/p>\n<p><strong>GET AROUND<br \/>\n<\/strong>Algeria is a\u00a0huge\u00a0country and travelling between major cities can take a lot of time and nerves as well, while the distances in the more populated north are not so big and a trip from the east to the west can be done in a 12 hours on highway. Travelling to cities in the Sahara is more difficult since the south is barely connected with good roads, train and bus connections.<br \/>\n<strong>By plane. <\/strong>From Algiers you can reach almost every major Algerian city by plane, and it is highly recommended to take a flight when travelling longer routes and to Saharan cities. Houari Boumediene, in Algiers, is the biggest airport in the country; there are other airports in major cities like Oran, Constantine &amp; Annaba. The other airports are basic .<br \/>\nAir Alg\u00e9ria is the national carrier with many flights to almost all Algerian cities with an airport. The prices vary regarding of the length of the flown route; airfares to smaller and Sahara cities tend to be pricier than between bigger cities (such as Oran to Algiers). The airline uses Houari Boumediene Airport as its hub, and almost all flights start or land there. There are seven daily flights to Oran from Algiers and five daily flights to Annaba and Constantine. Other destinations served from Algiers daily or several days weekly are Adrar, El Oued, Tebessa, Batna, Biskra, S\u00e9tif, In Ames, Tindouf, Timmoun, Tlemcen, Tamanrasset, Tiaret, Tebessa, El Goela, Ouaragla, Hassi Mesaoud, Bejaia, Ghrardaia, Tlemcen, Illizi, Djanet, Touggourt, and B\u00e9char.<br \/>\n<strong>By car.\u00a0<\/strong>The road network is well developed in the north, the Algerian government has made much improvements in the last years regarding road building, new highways were built to replace the already marod roads. The most important highway is the 1200 km long\u00a0N1 (Route est-ouest)\u00a0from Annaba to Oran, almost all bigger cities in the north are connected to this highway including Algiers.<br \/>\nA car is not absolutely necessary because of the well running public transportation system, but could be sometimes useful to reach more remote areas. Keep in mind that driving habits are completely different compared to western norms and that rules and prohibitive signs are more seen as guidelines, even by the police! It would be a wise decision letting a local Algerian do the driving for you in the first days to get an impression of the driving style, if this is not possible it&#8217;s recommended to stay on the highways.<br \/>\nDo not\u00a0try to reach Saharan areas with another car than a 4&#215;4, occasional dunes on the roads and extreme temperature changes will offer a challenge for the driver and the car.<br \/>\nFuel is extremely cheap and will not cost more than 31 DA per liter.<br \/>\n<strong>By train. <\/strong>The Algerian Railways are operated by\u00a0SNTF, currently the trains and lines are being modernised. Ten comfortable high speed trains named Autorail were bought, currently two of them are in operation. Tickets can not be bought online, only at the train stations, prices are quite moderate but more expensive than buses or taxis but in return you will have more comfort and enjoy wonderful landscapes. <em>Main Routes<\/em>\u00a0:<br \/>\nAlgiers to\u00a0Oran\u00a0, the train takes 4 hours and departs each day at 15:00 from Algiers Central Station and arrives in Oran at 19:30, 2nd Class: 1.000 DA, 1st Class: 1.500 DA.<br \/>\nAlgiers to\u00a0Annaba, on this route there&#8217;s a only a slow and less comfortable night train, departing each day at 20:45 and taking all the night for the way to Annaba. As an alternative you can catch the day train to\u00a0Constantine\u00a0and take from there a cheap taxi to Annaba.<br \/>\nAlgiers to\u00a0Constantine\u00a0departing each day at 06:45 and arriving in Constantine at 13:30, make sure that you get a window seat because the train will take you through the scenic Kabilyan mountains and wonderful landscapes, 2nd Class: 1.200 DA, 1st Class\u00a0: 1.800 DA.<br \/>\n<strong>Language.\u00a0<\/strong>The official languages are\u00a0Arabic\u00a0and Tamazight (Berber language). The dialects of Arabic spoken in the North African &#8220;Maghreb&#8221; Region are closely related to each other, but not to the Middle-Eastern ones. They are called Darja (or Darija) and have been influenced by French and Berber vocabulary to various degrees.<br \/>\nStandard Arabic is taught in schools from the very first year, and the vast majority of the population understands it. It is also the language used in newspapers and radio broadcasts. However, like in every Arab country, the locals feel uncomfortable speaking a literary, formal language, and will inevitably slip words from their dialect in it.<br \/>\nFrench, the colonial language, is still widely spoken, and almost every local that you meet will be bilingual in Arabic and French. It is the language of business and technology. Old and rural folk in addition to low-income individuals may have a heavily-accented, poorly worded French.<br \/>\nTamazight or Berber is also spoken by many people in Algeria, mainly in rural areas. Berber people are proud of their ancestry and you will rarely hear Arabic spoken inside their communities. The largest Berber groups are the Kabyles and Chaouis in the east, the Mzab in the interior, and the nomadic Tuaregs in the deep south.<br \/>\nMany young people now have at least basic knowledge of English, some (mostly the highly educated) reaching total fluency. The linguistics branch in High Schools enabled Algerians to learn Spanish and German, thus a minority of the population have some understanding of them.<br \/>\nSome common phrases in Algerian Arabic\u00a0:<br \/>\nWesh &#8211; Depending on context, can mean &#8220;Hi&#8221; or &#8220;What&#8221;<br \/>\nWesh bik &#8211; What&#8217;s wrong\/what&#8217;s the matter with you<br \/>\nWeshrak\/Kifesh rak \u2014 How are you?<br \/>\n\u00e7a va\/hamdullah (lit.Praise God) \u2014 Good<br \/>\nShukran\/Saha \u2014 Thank you<br \/>\nwasmi\/wasemni &#8230;. \u2014 My Name is &#8230;.<br \/>\nSalam alaikum \u2014 Hello (Reply is walaikum assalam)<br \/>\nBesslama\/Aaslama\/Hiya (slang)\/Bye \u2014 Good Bye<br \/>\nSbah al khir\/ Akhir! \u2014 Good Morning (Reply is Sabah al noor)<br \/>\nM&#8217;seh l&#8217;khir \u2014 Good afternoon \/ evening (Reply is Masah al noor)<br \/>\nS&#8217;il te pla\u00eet (french)\/yarham babak &#8211; Please<br \/>\nSmah li &#8211; Excuse me<\/p>\n<p><strong>MONEY<br \/>\n<\/strong>Algeria uses the\u00a0Algerian dinar\u00a0(DZD).\u00a0 USD1 = DZD119.05<br \/>\nThere are 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 dinar coins. Banknotes circulate in denominations of DZD100, DZD200, DZD500, DZD1000 and DZD2000.<br \/>\nMoney can be exchanged at Banks or Post offices. Make sure that the exchanged bills are in a good condition, people tend to be picky with accepting ripped and older bills. Be careful with other currencies than euro or US dollars it could be hard to find a bank that exchange less common currencies.<br \/>\nATMs are widely available and can be found in every post office or larger bank you can withdraw Algerian dinar with any major credit card and maestro cards. If a pin with 6 numbers is necessary just enter two zeros before your pin.<br \/>\nLiving in Algeria is very cheap compared to western conditions. For example, DZD300 will get you a full meal or bus ride from Algiers to Oran (400km). Renting a mid-sized apartment will cost normally DZD60,000 (6 months in the advance) a month.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CUISINE<br \/>\n<\/strong>Algerian food is delicious, varies from region to region, and is in general a mixture of Berber, French, Italian, Spanish, Turkish, and Arab cuisines.<br \/>\nCouscous (steamed semolina with sauce containing meat and carrots, courgette, turnips, or chick peas)<br \/>\nAlgerian Tajines (stew)<br \/>\nvariety of algerian pasta (chekh-choukha in the east,Trida,Chawwat&#8230;)<br \/>\nM&#8217;hajeb<br \/>\nChwa (algerian BBQ)<br \/>\nvariety of soups ( Chorba frik in the east, Hrira in the west)<br \/>\nvariety of breads (French baguettes, Kesra, Matloua&#8217;,khobz-eddar ..)<br \/>\nBouzellouf (cooked lambs head)<br \/>\nDowara (stew of stomach and intestines with courgette and chick peas)<br \/>\nRechta (hand made steamed vermicelli) served with chicken, zucchini and turnips )<br \/>\nChakchouka (normally, it has green peppers, onions and tomatoes; egg may be added)<br \/>\nMechoui (charcoal grilled lamb)<br \/>\nAlgerian pizza<br \/>\nMediterranean juices (grenadine, orange); very sweet green tea, and strong coffee.<br \/>\nQalb El Louz (dessert containing almonds)<br \/>\nBaklava (almond cakes drenched in honey)<br \/>\nKtayef (a kind of baked vermicelli, filled with almonds and drenched in sugar, syrup, and honey)<\/p>\n<p><strong>ACCOMMODATION <\/strong>The price of a beautiful deluxe room for a couple costs between \u20ac 150 and \u20ac 250 per day, as there are rooms from \u20ac 10 to \u20ac 45 for low budget tourists.<\/p>\n<p><strong>STAY SAFE<br \/>\n<\/strong>Despite many western advisory warnings against visiting Algeria, the security situation is getting better. Terrorism in 2005 was focused only in isolated areas such as heavily wooded mountains in less developed regions of the center and attacks near the Libyan or Malian border caused by war in those two countries. Security forces are doing their best to protect visitors to these areas, but tourists must take caution when visiting these places. They have to give their itinerary and plans to the local police before taking the road.<br \/>\nDo not travel after nightfall; travel by plane if you can rather than car; avoid minor roads; ask the police if you are unsure about your surroundings and nothing unusual should happen to you. Also, you should trust only\u00a0official\u00a0travel advisories when it comes to personal safety when you travel to a foreign country.<br \/>\nAs with most Muslim countries, prostitution is illegal and punishments are severe, so it&#8217;s best to avoid it while staying here.<br \/>\n<strong>Stay healthy. <\/strong>Huge improvements have been made in this sector with the construction of dozens of brand new hospitals throughout the country.<br \/>\nAlgerian doctors are highly qualified and offer a good service and pharmacies are well supplied.<br \/>\nMosquitoes are also a problem in Algeria, but they are just a nuisance, as malaria is not common. In urban areas, city-wide sprayings against mosquitoes are periodically carried on.<br \/>\nTap water is considered not drinkable although its quality is better than before. Once boiled, there is no problem in consuming it. Algeria enjoys a large variety of excellent mineral bottled water.<\/p>\n<p><strong>RESPECT<br \/>\n<\/strong>As in all of North Africa, the dominant religion in Algeria is Islam, and appropriate religious prohibitions and attitudes should be in order. If visiting a mosque, for example, be sure to be dressed conservatively and remove your shoes before entering it.<br \/>\nAlso, given the ongoing political strife, talking politics is not advisable. Even the mention of certain topics can draw unwanted attention and, at very least, make your visit far more unpleasant.<\/p>\n<p>Emergency phone numbers<br \/>\nPolice:\u00a017\u00a0or\u00a01548<br \/>\nCivil protection (medical emergency and fire department):\u00a014<br \/>\nNational Gendarmerie (especially outside cities):\u00a01055<br \/>\nSupport for children\u00a0:\u00a03033\u00a0.
