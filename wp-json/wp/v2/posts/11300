In 1856, southern Bessarabia was returned to Moldavia, which three years later united with\u00a0Wallachia\u00a0to form\u00a0Romania, but Russian rule was restored over the whole of the region in 1878. During the 1917\u00a0Russian Revolution, Bessarabia briefly became autonomous and then the independent\u00a0Moldavian Democratic Republic\u00a0until it was integrated into\u00a0Romania\u00a0in 1918 following a vote of its assembly. The decision was disputed by\u00a0Soviet Russia, which in 1924 decided the establishment, within the\u00a0Ukrainian SSR, of a\u00a0Moldavian autonomous republic\u00a0(MASSR) on partial Moldovan-inhabited territories to the east of the\u00a0Dniester. In 1940, as a consequence of the\u00a0Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, Romania was compelled to cede Bessarabia to the\u00a0Soviet Union, leading to the creation of the\u00a0Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic\u00a0(Moldavian SSR), which included the greater part of Bessarabia and the westernmost strip of the former MASSR.<br \/>\nOn 27 August 1991, as the\u00a0dissolution of the Soviet Union\u00a0was underway, the Moldavian SSR\u00a0declared independence\u00a0and took the name Moldova.\u00a0The\u00a0Constitution of Moldova\u00a0was adopted in 1994. The strip of the Moldovan territory on the east bank of the Dniester River has been under the\u00a0de facto\u00a0control of the breakaway government of\u00a0Transnistria\u00a0since 1990.<br \/>\nDue to a decrease in industrial and agricultural output following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the\u00a0service sector\u00a0has grown to dominate\u00a0Moldova&#8217;s economy\u00a0and is over 60% of the nation&#8217;s\u00a0GDP. Its economy is the poorest in Europe in per capita terms and has the lowest\u00a0Human Development Index\u00a0in the continent. Moldova is also the least visited country in Europe by tourists with only 11,000 annually recorded visitors from abroad.<br \/>\nMoldova is a\u00a0parliamentary republic\u00a0with a\u00a0president\u00a0as\u00a0head of state\u00a0and a\u00a0prime minister\u00a0as\u00a0head of government. It is a member state of the\u00a0United Nations, the\u00a0Council of Europe, the\u00a0World Trade Organization (WTO), the\u00a0Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the\u00a0GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development, the\u00a0Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)\u00a0and the\u00a0Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC)\u00a0and aspires to join the\u00a0European Union.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Etymology<br \/>\n<\/strong>The name &#8220;Moldova&#8221; is derived from the\u00a0Moldova River; the valley of this river served as a political centre at the time of the\u00a0foundation\u00a0of the\u00a0Principality of Moldavia\u00a0in 1359.\u00a0The origin of the name of the river remains unclear. According to a legend recounted by Moldavian chroniclers\u00a0Dimitrie Cantemir\u00a0and\u00a0Grigore Ureche, Prince\u00a0Drago\u0219\u00a0named the river after hunting an\u00a0aurochs: following the chase, the prince&#8217;s exhausted hound\u00a0Molda\u00a0drowned in the river. The dog&#8217;s name, given to the river, extended to the Principality.<br \/>\nFor a short time in the 1990s, at the founding of the\u00a0Commonwealth of Independent States, the name of the current Republic of Moldova was also spelled &#8220;Moldavia&#8221;.\u00a0After the\u00a0dissolution of the Soviet Union, the country began to use the Romanian name,\u00a0Moldova. Officially, the name\u00a0Republic of Moldova\u00a0is designated by the\u00a0United Nations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HISTORY<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Prehistory. <\/strong>The prehistory of Moldova covers the period from the\u00a0Upper Paleolithic\u00a0which begins with the presence of\u00a0Homo sapiens\u00a0in the area of\u00a0Southeastern Europe\u00a0some 44,000 years ago and extends into the appearance of the first written records in\u00a0Classical Antiquity\u00a0in\u00a0Greece.<br \/>\nIn 2010 N.K. Anisjutkin discovered\u00a0Oldowan\u00a0flint tools at Bayraki that are 800,000\u20131.2 million years old.\u00a0During the\u00a0Neolithic stone-age\u00a0era, Moldova&#8217;s territory stood at the centre of the large\u00a0Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture\u00a0that stretched east beyond the\u00a0Dniester River\u00a0in Ukraine and west up to and beyond the\u00a0Carpathian Mountains\u00a0in Romania. The people of this civilization, which lasted roughly from 5500 to 2750 BC, practised agriculture, raised livestock, hunted, and made intricately-designed pottery.<br \/>\n<strong>Antiquity and the early Middle Ages. <\/strong>In\u00a0antiquity, Moldova&#8217;s territory was inhabited by\u00a0Dacian\u00a0tribes. Between the 1st and 7th centuries AD, the south was intermittently under the\u00a0Roman, and then\u00a0Byzantine Empires. Due to its strategic location on a route between Asia and Europe, the territory of modern Moldova was invaded many times in late antiquity and the\u00a0early Middle Ages, including by\u00a0Goths,\u00a0Huns,\u00a0Avars,\u00a0Bulgarians,\u00a0Magyars,\u00a0Pechenegs,\u00a0Cumans,\u00a0Mongols\u00a0and Tartars. <strong><br \/>\n<\/strong>The\u00a0Bolohoveni, a\u00a0Vlach population, is mentioned by the\u00a0Hypatian Chronicle\u00a0in the 13th century. The chronicle shows that this land is bordered on the principalities of\u00a0Halych,\u00a0Volhynia\u00a0and\u00a0Kiev. Archaeological research also identified the location of 13th-century fortified settlements in this region &#8211; Voscodavie, Voscodavti, Voloscovti, Volcovti, Volosovca and their other towns and villages between the middle course of the rivers Nistru\/Dniester and Nipru\/Dnieper.\u00a0The Bolohoveni disappeared from chronicles after their defeat in 1257 by\u00a0Daniel of Galicia&#8217;s troops.<br \/>\nIn the early 13th century, the\u00a0Brodniks, a possible\u00a0Slavic\u2013Vlach\u00a0vassal\u00a0state of\u00a0Halych, were present, alongside the Vlachs, in much of the region&#8217;s territory.<br \/>\nOn the border between Halych and the Brodniks, in the 11th century, a\u00a0Viking\u00a0by the name of Rodfos was killed in the area by Vlachs who supposedly betrayed him.\u00a0In 1164, the future\u00a0Byzantine emperor\u00a0Andronikos I Komnenos, was taken prisoner by Vlach shepherds around the same region.<br \/>\n<strong>Founding of the Principality of Moldavia. <\/strong>The founding\u00a0began with the arrival of a\u00a0Vlach\u00a0voivode\u00a0(military leader),\u00a0Drago\u0219, soon followed by his people from\u00a0Maramure\u0219\u00a0to the region of the\u00a0Moldova River. Drago\u0219 established a\u00a0polity\u00a0there as a vassal to the\u00a0Kingdom of Hungary\u00a0in the 1350s. The independence of the\u00a0Principality\u00a0of\u00a0Moldavia\u00a0was gained when\u00a0Bogdan I, another Vlach voivode from Maramure\u0219 who had fallen out with the Hungarian king, crossed the\u00a0Carpathian mountains\u00a0in 1359 and took control of Moldavia, wresting the region from Hungary. The Principality of\u00a0Moldavia\u00a0was bounded by the\u00a0Carpathian Mountains\u00a0in the west, the\u00a0Dniester\u00a0River in the east, and the Danube River and\u00a0Black Sea\u00a0to the south. Its territory comprised the present-day territory of the Republic of Moldova, the\u00a0eastern eight counties\u00a0of Romania, and parts of the\u00a0Chernivtsi Oblast\u00a0and\u00a0Budjak\u00a0region of Ukraine. Like the present-day republic and Romania&#8217;s north-eastern region, it was known to the locals as\u00a0Moldova.<br \/>\n<strong>Between Poland and Hungary<\/strong>. The history of what is today Moldova has been intertwined with that of Poland for centuries. The Polish state was powerful enough to counter the\u00a0Hungarian Kingdom\u00a0which was consistently interested in bringing the area that would become Moldova into its political orbit.<br \/>\nTies between Poland and Moldavia expanded after the founding of the Moldavian state by\u00a0Bogdan of Cuhea, a Vlach\u00a0voivode\u00a0from\u00a0Maramure\u0219\u00a0who had fallen out with the Hungarian king. Crossing the\u00a0Carpathian mountains\u00a0in 1359, the voivode took control of Moldavia and succeeded in creating Moldavia as an independent political entity. Despite being disfavored by the brief union of\u00a0Angevin Poland\u00a0and Hungary (the latter was still the country&#8217;s overlord), Bogdan&#8217;s successor\u00a0La\u021bcu, the Moldavian ruler also likely allied himself with the\u00a0Poles. La\u021bcu also accepted\u00a0conversion\u00a0to\u00a0Roman Catholicism\u00a0around 1370, but his gesture was to remain without consequences.<br \/>\nPetru I\u00a0profited from the end of the Polish-Hungarian union and moved the country closer to the\u00a0Jagiellon realm, becoming a\u00a0vassal\u00a0of king\u00a0Jogaila of Poland\u00a0on September 26, 1387. This gesture was to have unexpected consequences: Petru supplied the Polish ruler with funds needed in the war against the\u00a0Teutonic Knights, and was granted control over\u00a0Pokuttya\u00a0until the debt was to be repaid; as this is not recorded to have been carried out, the region became disputed by the two states, until it was lost by Moldavia in the\u00a0Battle of Obertyn (1531). Prince Petru also expanded his rule southwards to the\u00a0Danube Delta. His brother Roman I conquered the Hungarian-ruled\u00a0Cetatea Alb\u0103\u00a0in 1392, giving Moldavia an outlet to the\u00a0Black Sea, before being toppled from the throne for supporting\u00a0Fyodor Koriatovych\u00a0in his conflict with\u00a0Vytautas the Great\u00a0of\u00a0Lithuania. Under\u00a0Stephen I, growing Polish influence was challenged by\u00a0Sigismund of Hungary, whose expedition was defeated at\u00a0Ghind\u0103oani\u00a0in 1385; however, Stephen disappeared in mysterious circumstances.<br \/>\nAlthough\u00a0Alexander I\u00a0was brought to the throne in 1400 by the Hungarians (with assistance from\u00a0Mircea I of Wallachia), this ruler shifted his allegiances towards Poland (notably engaging Moldavian forces on the Polish side in the\u00a0Battle of Grunwald\u00a0and the\u00a0Siege of Marienburg), and placed his own choice of rulers in Wallachia. His reign was one of the most successful in Moldavia&#8217;s history.<br \/>\n<strong>The Ottomans. <\/strong>For all of his success, it was under the reign of Alexander I that the very first confrontation with the\u00a0Ottoman Turks\u00a0took place at Cetatea Alb\u0103 in 1420. A deep crisis was to follow Alexandru&#8217;s long reign, with his successors battling each other in a succession of wars that divided the country until the murder of\u00a0Bogdan II\u00a0and the ascension of\u00a0Peter III Aaron\u00a0in 1451. Nevertheless, Moldavia was subject to further Hungarian interventions after that moment, as\u00a0Matthias Corvinus\u00a0deposed Aron and backed\u00a0Alex\u0103ndrel\u00a0to the throne in\u00a0Suceava. Petru Aron&#8217;s rule also signified the beginning of Moldavia&#8217;s\u00a0Ottoman Empire\u00a0allegiance, as the ruler agreed to pay\u00a0tribute\u00a0to Sultan\u00a0Mehmed II.<br \/>\nDuring this time, Moldavia was invaded repeatedly by Crimean\u00a0Tatars\u00a0and, beginning in the 15th century, by the Turks. In 1538, the principality became a\u00a0tributary\u00a0to the\u00a0Ottoman Empire, but it retained internal and partial external autonomy.\u00a0In May 1600,\u00a0Michael the Brave\u00a0removed\u00a0Ieremia Movil\u0103\u00a0from Moldavia&#8217;s throne by winning the battle of\u00a0Bac\u0103u, briefly reuniting under his rule\u00a0Moldavia,\u00a0Wallachia, and\u00a0Transylvania. A Polish army led by\u00a0Jan Zamoyski\u00a0drove the Wallachians from Moldavia and reinstalled Ieremia Movil\u0103 to the throne, who put the country under the vassalage of the\u00a0Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. Moldavia finally returned to Ottoman vassalage in 1621.<br \/>\nWhile\u00a0Transnistria\u00a0was never politically part of the Principality of Moldavia, there were sizable areas which were owned by Moldavian boyars and given by the Moldavian rulers. The earliest surviving deeds referring to lands beyond the Dniester river date from the 16th century.\u00a0Moldavian chronicle\u00a0Grigore Ureche\u00a0which mentions that in 1584, some Moldavian villages from beyond the Dniester in the\u00a0Kingdom of Poland\u00a0were attacked and plundered by\u00a0Cossacks.\u00a0Many Moldovans were members of Cossacks units as well, with two of them,\u00a0Ioan Potcoav\u0103\u00a0and\u00a0D\u0103nil\u0103 Apostol\u00a0becoming\u00a0hetmans\u00a0of\u00a0Ukraine.\u00a0Ruxandra Lupu, the daughter of Moldavian voivode\u00a0Vasile Lupu\u00a0who married\u00a0Tymish Khmelnytsky, lived in\u00a0Ra\u015fcov\u00a0according to Ukrainian tradition.<br \/>\nWhile most of today&#8217;s Moldova came into the Ottoman orbit in the 16th century, a substantial part of\u00a0Transnistria\u00a0remained a part of the\u00a0Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth\u00a0until the\u00a0Second Partition of Poland\u00a0in 1793.<br \/>\n<strong>Modern history<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Russian Empire<\/strong>. In accordance with the\u00a0Treaty of Bucharest of 1812, and despite numerous protests by Moldavian nobles on behalf of the sovereignty of their principality, the\u00a0Ottoman Empire(of which Moldavia was a\u00a0vassal) ceded to the\u00a0Russian Empire\u00a0the\u00a0eastern half of the territory\u00a0of the Principality of Moldavia along with\u00a0Khotyn\u00a0and old Bessarabia (modern\u00a0Budjak), which Russia had already conquered and annexed. The new Russian province was called\u00a0Oblast of Moldavia and Bessarabia, and initially enjoyed a large degree of autonomy. After 1828 this autonomy was progressively restricted and in 1871 the Oblast was transformed into the Bessarabia Governorate, in a process of\u00a0state-imposed assimilation,\u00a0Russification. As part of this process, the\u00a0Tsarist\u00a0administration in Bessarabia gradually removed the\u00a0Romanian language\u00a0from official and religious use.<br \/>\nThe\u00a0Treaty of Paris (1856)\u00a0returned the southern part of Bessarabia (later organised as the\u00a0Cahul, Bolgrad and Ismail counties) to Moldavia, which remained an autonomous principality and, in 1859,\u00a0united\u00a0with\u00a0Wallachia\u00a0to form\u00a0Romania. In 1878, as a result of the\u00a0Treaty of Berlin, Romania was forced to cede the three counties back to the Russian Empire.<br \/>\nOver the 19th century, the Russian authorities encouraged the\u00a0colonization\u00a0of Bessarabia by\u00a0Romanians,\u00a0Russians,\u00a0Ukrainians,\u00a0Germans,\u00a0Bulgarians, and\u00a0Gagauzes, primarily in the northern and southern areas vacated by Turks and\u00a0Nogai\u00a0Tatar, the latter having been expelled in the 1770s and 1780s, during\u00a0Russo-Turkish Wars;\u00a0the inclusion of the province in the\u00a0Pale of Settlement\u00a0also allowed the immigration of more\u00a0Jews.\u00a0The Romanian proportion of the population decreased from an estimated 86% in 1816,\u00a0to around 52% in 1905.\u00a0During this time there were anti-Semitic riots, leading to an exodus of thousands of Jews to the United States.<br \/>\n<strong>Russian Revolution and Greater Romania. <\/strong>World War I\u00a0brought in a rise in political and cultural (ethnic) awareness among the inhabitants of the region, as 300,000 Bessarabians were drafted into the\u00a0Russian Army\u00a0formed in 1917; within bigger units several &#8220;Moldavian Soldiers&#8217; Committees&#8221; were formed. Following the\u00a0Russian Revolution of 1917, a Bessarabian parliament,\u00a0Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii\u00a0(a National Council), was\u00a0elected in October\u2013November 1917\u00a0and opened on December 3,\u00a01917. The Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii proclaimed the\u00a0Moldavian Democratic Republic\u00a0within a federal Russian state, and formed a\u00a0government.<br \/>\nBessarabia proclaimed independence from Russia on February 6,\u00a01918 and requested the assistance of the French army present in Romania (general\u00a0Henri Berthelot) and of the\u00a0Romanian army, which had occupied the region in early January at the request of the National Council.\u00a0On April 9,\u00a01918, the Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii decided with 86 votes for, 3 against and 36 abstaining, to\u00a0unite with the Kingdom of Romania. The union was conditional upon fulfillment of the\u00a0agrarian reform, autonomy, and respect for universal human rights.\u00a0A part of the interim Parliament agreed to drop these conditions after\u00a0Bukovina\u00a0and\u00a0Transylvania\u00a0also joined the\u00a0Kingdom of Romania, although historians note that they lacked the\u00a0quorum\u00a0to do so.<br \/>\nThis union was recognized by the principal\u00a0Allied Powers\u00a0in the\u00a01920 Treaty of Paris, which however was not ratified by all of its signatories.\u00a0The\u00a0newly communist Russia did not recognize Romanian rule over Bessarabia, considering it an occupation of Russian territory.<br \/>\nIn May 1919, the\u00a0Bessarabian Soviet Socialist Republic\u00a0was proclaimed as a government in exile. After the failure of the\u00a0Tatarbunary Uprising\u00a0in 1924, the\u00a0Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic\u00a0(Moldavian ASSR) was formed by Soviet Russia within the territory of the\u00a0Ukrainian SSR, the present-day\u00a0Transnistria.<br \/>\n<strong>World War II and Soviet era. <\/strong>In August 1939, the\u00a0Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact\u00a0and its secret additional protocol were signed, by which\u00a0Nazi Germany\u00a0recognized Bessarabia as being within the\u00a0Soviet sphere of influence, which led the latter to actively revive its claim to the region.\u00a0On 28 June 1940, the Soviet Union issued an\u00a0ultimatum to Romania\u00a0requesting the cession of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, with which Romania complied the following day. Soon after, the\u00a0Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic\u00a0(Moldavian SSR, MSSR) was established,\u00a0comprising about 65% of Bessarabia, and 50% of the now-disbanded Moldavian ASSR. Ethnic Germans\u00a0left\u00a0in 1940.<br \/>\nAs part of the 1941\u00a0Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, Romania regained the territories of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, and seized\u00a0Transnistria. Romanian forces, working with the Germans, deported or massacred about 300,000 Jews, including 147,000 from Bessarabia and Bukovina. Of the latter, approximately 90,000 died.\u00a0The Soviet Army re-captured the region in February\u2013August 1944, and re-established the Moldavian SSR. Between the end of the\u00a0Jassy\u2013Kishinev Offensive\u00a0in August 1944 and the end of the war in May 1945, 256,800 inhabitants of the Moldavian SSR were drafted into the Soviet Army. 40,592 of them perished.<br \/>\nDuring the periods 1940\u20131941 and 1944\u20131953,\u00a0deportations of locals\u00a0to the northern\u00a0Urals, to\u00a0Siberia, and northern\u00a0Kazakhstan\u00a0occurred regularly, with the largest ones on 12\u201313 June 1941, and 5\u20136 July 1949, accounting from MSSR alone for 18,392\u00a0and 35,796 deportees respectively.\u00a0Other forms of Soviet persecution of the population included political arrests or, in 8,360 cases, execution.<br \/>\nIn 1946, as a result of a severe drought and excessive delivery quota obligations and requisitions imposed by the Soviet government, the southwestern part of the USSR suffered from a major\u00a0famine.\u00a0In 1946\u20131947, at least 216,000 deaths and about 350,000 cases of dystrophy were accounted by historians in the Moldavian SSR alone.\u00a0Similar events occurred in the 1930s in the\u00a0Moldavian ASSR.\u00a0In 1944\u201353, there were several anti-Soviet resistance groups in Moldova; however the\u00a0NKVD\u00a0and later\u00a0MGB\u00a0managed to eventually arrest, execute or deport their members.<br \/>\nIn the postwar period, the Soviet government organized the immigration of working age Russian speakers (mostly Russians,\u00a0Belarusians, and Ukrainians), into the new Soviet republic, especially into urbanized areas, partly to compensate for the demographic loss caused by the war and the emigration of 1940 and 1944.\u00a0In the 1970s and 1980s, the Moldavian SSR received substantial allocations from the budget of the USSR to develop industrial and scientific facilities and housing. In 1971, the\u00a0Council of Ministers of the USSR\u00a0adopted a decision &#8220;About the measures for further development of the city of\u00a0Kishinev&#8221; (modern Chi\u0219in\u0103u), that allotted more than one\u00a0billion\u00a0Soviet rubles\u00a0(approximately 6.8 billion in 2018 US dollars) from the USSR budget for building projects.<br \/>\nThe Soviet government conducted a campaign to promote a Moldovan ethnic identity distinct from that of the Romanians, based on a theory developed during the existence of the\u00a0Moldavian ASSR. Official Soviet policy asserted that the language spoken by\u00a0Moldovans\u00a0was distinct from the\u00a0Romanian language. To distinguish the two, during the Soviet period, Moldovan was written in the\u00a0Cyrillic alphabet, in contrast with Romanian, which since 1860 had been written in the\u00a0Latin alphabet.<br \/>\nAll independent organizations were severely reprimanded, with the\u00a0National Patriotic Front\u00a0leaders being sentenced in 1972 to long prison terms.\u00a0The\u00a0Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Moldova\u00a0is assessing the activity of the communist totalitarian regime.<br \/>\nIn the 1980s, amid political conditions created by the\u00a0glasnost\u00a0and\u00a0perestroika, a\u00a0Democratic Movement of Moldova\u00a0was formed, which in 1989 became known as the nationalist\u00a0Popular Front of Moldova\u00a0(FPM).\u00a0Along with several other Soviet republics, from 1988 onwards, Moldova started to move towards\u00a0independence. On 27 August 1989, the FPM organized a mass demonstration in Chi\u0219in\u0103u that became known as the\u00a0Grand National Assembly. The assembly pressured the authorities of the Moldavian SSR to adopt a language law on 31 August 1989 that proclaimed the Moldovan language written in the\u00a0Latin script\u00a0to be the state language of the MSSR. Its identity with the Romanian language was also established.\u00a0In 1989, as opposition to the\u00a0Communist Party\u00a0grew, there were\u00a0major riots in November.<br \/>\n<strong>Independence. <\/strong>The\u00a0first democratic elections\u00a0for the local\u00a0parliament\u00a0were held in February and March 1990.\u00a0Mircea Snegur\u00a0was elected as\u00a0Speaker of the Parliament, and\u00a0Mircea Druc\u00a0as Prime Minister. On 23 June 1990, the Parliament adopted the Declaration of Sovereignty of the &#8220;Soviet Socialist Republic Moldova&#8221;, which, among other things, stipulated the supremacy of Moldovan laws over those of the Soviet Union.\u00a0After the failure of the\u00a01991 Soviet coup d&#8217;\u00e9tat attempt,\u00a0Moldova declared its independence\u00a0on 27 August 1991.<br \/>\nOn 21 December of the same year, Moldova, along with most of the other Soviet republics, signed the constitutive act that formed the post-Soviet\u00a0Commonwealth of Independent States\u00a0(CIS). Moldova received official recognition on 25 December. On 26 December 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist. Declaring itself a\u00a0neutral state, Moldova did not join the military branch of the CIS. Three months later, on 2 March 1992, the country gained formal recognition as an independent state at the United Nations. In 1994, Moldova became a member of\u00a0NATO&#8217;s\u00a0Partnership for Peace\u00a0program, and a member of the Council of Europe on 29 June 1995.<br \/>\nIn the region east of the\u00a0Dniester\u00a0river,\u00a0Transnistria, which includes a large proportion of predominantly\u00a0russophone\u00a0East Slavs\u00a0of Ukrainian (28%) and Russian (26%) descent (altogether 54% as of 1989), an independent\u00a0Pridnestrovian Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic\u00a0was proclaimed on 16 August 1990, with its capital in\u00a0Tiraspol.\u00a0The motives behind this move were fear of the rise of nationalism in Moldova. In the winter of 1991\u20131992 clashes occurred between Transnistrian forces,\u00a0supported by elements of the 14th Army, and the\u00a0Moldovan police. Between 2 March and 26 July 1992, the conflict escalated into a\u00a0military engagement.<br \/>\nOn 2 January 1992, Moldova introduced a\u00a0market economy, liberalizing prices, which resulted in rapid inflation. From 1992 to 2001, the country suffered a serious economic crisis, leaving most of the population below the poverty line. In 1993, the government introduced a new national currency, the\u00a0Moldovan leu, to replace the\u00a0temporary cupon. The\u00a0economy of Moldova\u00a0began to change in 2001; and until 2008 the country saw a steady annual growth between 5% and 10%. The early 2000s also saw a considerable growth of emigration of Moldovans looking for work (mostly illegally) in Russia (especially the Moscow region), Italy, Portugal, Spain, and other countries;\u00a0remittances\u00a0from Moldovans abroad account for almost 38% of Moldova&#8217;s\u00a0GDP, the second-highest percentage in the world, after\u00a0Tajikistan\u00a0(45%).<br \/>\nIn the\u00a01994 parliamentary elections, the\u00a0Democratic Agrarian Party\u00a0gained a majority of the seats, setting a turning point in Moldovan politics. With the nationalist Popular Front now in a parliamentary minority, new measures aiming to moderate the ethnic tensions in the country could be adopted. Plans for a\u00a0union with Romania\u00a0were abandoned, and the new\u00a0Constitution\u00a0gave autonomy to the breakaway Transnistria and Gagauzia. On 23 December 1994, the Parliament of Moldova adopted a &#8220;Law on the Special Legal Status of Gagauzia&#8221;, and in 1995 the latter was constituted.<br \/>\nAfter winning the\u00a01996 presidential elections, on 15 January 1997,\u00a0Petru Lucinschi, the former First Secretary of the\u00a0Moldavian Communist Party\u00a0in 1989\u201391, became the country&#8217;s second president (1997\u20132001), succeeding Mircea Snegur (1991\u20131996). In 2000, the Constitution was amended, transforming Moldova into a\u00a0parliamentary republic, with the president being chosen through\u00a0indirect election\u00a0rather than direct popular vote.<br \/>\nWinning 49.9% of the vote, the\u00a0Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova\u00a0(reinstituted in 1993 after being outlawed in 1991), gained 71 of the 101 MPs, and on 4 April 2001, elected\u00a0Vladimir Voronin\u00a0as the country&#8217;s third president (re-elected in 2005). The country became the first post-Soviet state where a non-reformed Communist Party returned to power.\u00a0New governments were formed by\u00a0Vasile Tarlev\u00a0(19 April 2001 \u2013 31 March 2008), and\u00a0Zinaida Grecean\u00eei\u00a0(31 March 2008 \u2013 14 September 2009). In 2001\u20132003\u00a0relations between Moldova and Russia\u00a0improved, but then temporarily deteriorated in 2003\u20132006, in the wake of the failure of the\u00a0Kozak memorandum, culminating in the\u00a02006 wine exports crisis. The Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova managed to stay in power for eight years. The fragmentation of the liberal bloc helped consolidate its power. The decline of the Communist Party started in 2009 after Marian Lupu joined the Democratic Party.<br \/>\nIn the\u00a0April 2009 parliamentary elections, the Communist Party won 49.48% of the votes, followed by the\u00a0Liberal Party\u00a0with 13.14% of the votes, the\u00a0Liberal Democratic Partywith 12.43%, and the\u00a0Alliance &#8220;Moldova Noastr\u0103&#8221;\u00a0with 9.77%. The controversial results of this election sparked\u00a0civil unrest.<br \/>\nIn August 2009, four Moldovan parties (Liberal Democratic Party, Liberal Party,\u00a0Democratic Party, and Our Moldova Alliance) agreed to create the\u00a0Alliance For European Integration\u00a0that pushed the\u00a0Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova\u00a0into opposition. On 28 August 2009, this coalition chose a new\u00a0parliament speaker\u00a0(Mihai Ghimpu) in a vote that was boycotted by Communist legislators.\u00a0Vladimir Voronin, who had been\u00a0President of Moldova\u00a0since 2001, eventually resigned on 11 September 2009, but the\u00a0Parliament failed to elect a new president. The acting president Mihai Ghimpu instituted the\u00a0Commission for constitutional reform in Moldova\u00a0to adopt a new version of the Constitution of Moldova. After the\u00a0constitutional referendum\u00a0aimed to approve the reform failed in September 2010,\u00a0the parliament was dissolved again and a\u00a0new parliamentary election\u00a0was scheduled for 28 November 2010.\u00a0On 30 December 2010, Marian Lupu was elected as the Speaker of the Parliament and the acting President of Republic of Moldova.\u00a0After the Alliance for European Integration lost a no confidence vote, the\u00a0Pro-European Coalition\u00a0was formed on 30 May 2013.<br \/>\nIn November 2014, Moldova&#8217;s central bank took control of\u00a0Banca de Economii, the country&#8217;s largest lender, and two smaller institutions,\u00a0Banca Sociala\u00a0and\u00a0Unibank. Investigations into activities at these three banks uncovered a\u00a0large-scale fraud\u00a0by means of fraudulent loans to business entities controlled by a Moldovan-Israeli\u00a0business oligarch,\u00a0Ilan Shor, of funds worth about 1 billion U.S. dollars.\u00a0The large scale of the fraud compared to the size of the Moldovan economy are cited as tilting the country&#8217;s politics in favour of the pro-Russian\u00a0Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova.\u00a0In 2015, Shor was still at large, after a period of house arrest.<br \/>\nFollowing a period of political instability and massive public protests, a new Government led by\u00a0Pavel Filip\u00a0was invested in January 2016.\u00a0Concerns over statewide corruption, the independence of the judiciary system, and the intransparency of the banking system, were expressed during the visit; Germany&#8217;s broadcaster\u00a0Deutsche Welle\u00a0also raised concerns over the alleged influence of Moldovan oligarch\u00a0Vladimir Plahotniuc\u00a0over the Pavel government.<br \/>\nIn the\u00a0December 2016 presidential election, Socialist, pro-Russian\u00a0Igor Dodon\u00a0was elected as the new president of the republic.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GOVERNMENT<br \/>\n<\/strong>Moldova is a\u00a0unitary\u00a0parliamentary\u00a0representative\u00a0democratic\u00a0republic. The 1994 Constitution of Moldova sets the framework for the government of the country. A parliamentary majority of at least two-thirds is required to amend the\u00a0Constitution of Moldova, which cannot be revised in time of war or national emergency. Amendments to the Constitution affecting the state&#8217;s sovereignty, independence, or unity can only be made after a majority of voters support the proposal in a referendum. Furthermore, no revision can be made to limit the fundamental rights of people enumerated in the Constitution.<br \/>\nThe country&#8217;s central legislative body is the\u00a0unicameral\u00a0Moldovan Parliament\u00a0(Parlament), which has 101 seats, and whose members are elected by popular vote on\u00a0party lists\u00a0every four years.<br \/>\nThe head of state is the President of Moldova, who between 2001 and 2015 was elected by the Moldovan Parliament, requiring the support of three-fifths of the deputies (at least 61 votes). The president of Moldova has been elected by the parliament since 2001, a change designed to decrease executive authority in favour of the legislature. Nevertheless, the\u00a0Constitutional Court\u00a0ruled on 4 March 2016, that this constitutional change adopted in 2000 regarding the presidential election was unconstitutional,\u00a0thus reverting the election method of the President to a\u00a0two-round system direct election.<br \/>\nOn 19 December 2016, Moldovan MPs approved raising the retirement age to 63 years\u00a0from the current level of 57 for women and 62 for men, a reform that is part of a 3-year-old assistance program agreed with the International Monetary Fund. The retirement age will be lifted gradually by a few months every year until coming fully into effect in 2028.<br \/>\nLife expectancy in the ex-Soviet country (which is among Europe&#8217;s poorest) is 67.5 years for men and 75.5 years for women. In a country with a population of 3.5 million, of which 1 million are abroad, there are more than 700,000 pensioners.<\/p>\n<p><strong>FOREIGN RELATIONS<br \/>\n<\/strong>After achieving independence from the Soviet Union, Moldova&#8217;s foreign policy was designed with a view to establishing relations with other European countries, neutrality, and European Union integration. In 1995 the country was admitted to the\u00a0Council of Europe.<br \/>\nIn addition to its participation in\u00a0NATO&#8217;s\u00a0Partnership for Peace\u00a0programe, Moldova is also a member state of the\u00a0United Nations, the\u00a0Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe\u00a0(OSCE), the\u00a0North Atlantic Cooperation Council, the\u00a0World Trade Organization, the\u00a0International Monetary Fund, the\u00a0World Bank, the\u00a0Francophonie\u00a0and the\u00a0European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.<br \/>\nIn 2005,\u00a0Moldova and the EU\u00a0established an action plan that sought to improve collaboration between its two neighbouring countries, Romania and Ukraine. At the end of 2005 EUBAM, the\u00a0European Union Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine, was established at the joint request of the presidents of Moldova and Ukraine. EUBAM assists the Moldovan and Ukrainian governments in approximating their border and customs procedures to EU standards and offers support in both countries&#8217; fight against cross-border crime.<br \/>\nAfter the 1990\u20131992\u00a0War of Transnistria, Moldova sought a peaceful resolution to the conflict in the Transnistria region by working with Romania, Ukraine, and Russia, calling for international mediation, and co-operating with the OSCE and UN fact-finding and observer missions. The\u00a0foreign minister of Moldova,\u00a0Andrei Stratan, repeatedly stated that the Russian troops stationed in the breakaway region were there against the will of the Moldovan government and called on them to leave &#8220;completely and unconditionally&#8221;.\u00a0In 2012, a\u00a0security zone incident\u00a0resulted in the death of a civilian, raising tensions with\u00a0Russia.<br \/>\nIn September 2010, the\u00a0European Parliament\u00a0approved a grant of \u20ac90 million to Moldova.\u00a0The money was to supplement US$570 million in International Monetary Fund loans,\u00a0World Bank and other bilateral support already granted to Moldova. In April 2010, Romania offered Moldova development aid worth of \u20ac100 million while the number of scholarships for Moldovan students doubled to 5,000.\u00a0According to a lending agreement signed in February 2010, Poland provided US$15 million as a component of its support for Moldova in its European integration efforts.\u00a0The first joint meeting of the Governments of Romania and Moldova, held in March 2012, concluded with several bilateral agreements in various fields.\u00a0The European orientation &#8220;has been the policy of Moldova in recent years and this is the policy that must continue,&#8221;\u00a0Nicolae Timofti\u00a0told lawmakers before\u00a0his election.<br \/>\nOn 29 November 2013, at a summit in Vilnius, Moldova signed an association agreement with the European Union dedicated to the European Union&#8217;s &#8216;Eastern Partnership&#8217; with ex-Soviet countries.\u00a0The ex-Romanian President\u00a0Traian B\u0103sescu\u00a0stated that\u00a0Romania\u00a0will make all efforts for Moldova to join the EU as soon as possible. Likewise, Traian B\u0103sescu declared that the\u00a0unification of Moldova with Romania\u00a0is the next national project for Romania, as more than 75% of the population speaks Romanian.<br \/>\nMoldova has signed the Association Agreement with the European Union in Brussels on 27 June 2014. The signing comes after the accord has been initialed in Vilnius in November 2013.<br \/>\nIt can be said that religious leaders play a role in shaping foreign policy. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian Government has frequently used its connections with the\u00a0Russian Orthodox Church\u00a0to block and stymie the integration of former Soviet states like Moldova into the West.<br \/>\n<strong>Military.<\/strong> The Moldovan armed forces consist of the\u00a0Ground Forces\u00a0and\u00a0Air Force. Moldova has accepted all relevant arms control obligations of the former Soviet Union. On 30 October 1992, Moldova ratified the\u00a0Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, which establishes comprehensive limits on key categories of conventional military equipment and provides for the destruction of weapons in excess of those limits. The country acceded to the provisions of the nuclear\u00a0Non-Proliferation Treaty\u00a0in October 1994 in\u00a0Washington, D.C.\u00a0It does not have nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons. Moldova joined the\u00a0North Atlantic Treaty Organisation&#8217;s\u00a0Partnership for Peace\u00a0on 16 March 1994.<br \/>\nMoldova is committed to a number of international and regional control of arms regulations such as the UN Firearms Protocol, Stability Pact Regional Implementation Plan, the UN Programme of Action (PoA) and the OSCE Documents on Stockpiles of Conventional Ammunition.<br \/>\nSince declaring independence in 1991, Moldova has participated in UN peacekeeping missions in Liberia, C\u00f4te d&#8217;Ivoire, Sudan and Georgia.<br \/>\nMoldova signed a military agreement with Romania to strengthen regional security. The agreement is part of Moldova&#8217;s strategy to reform its military and cooperate with its neighbours.<br \/>\nOn 12 November 2014, the US donated to Moldovan Armed Forces 39\u00a0Humvees\u00a0and 10 trailers, with a value of US$700,000, to the 22nd Peacekeeping Battalion of the Moldovan National Army to &#8220;increase the capability of Moldovan peacekeeping contingents.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>HUMAN RIGHTS<br \/>\n<\/strong>According to\u00a0Amnesty International, as of 2004 &#8220;Torture and other ill-treatment in police detention remained widespread; the state failed to carry out prompt and impartial investigations and police officers sometimes evaded penalties. Political dissidents from\u00a0Ila\u0219cu Group\u00a0were released from arbitrary detention in the break-away Transdinester region only after an order of the\u00a0European Court of Human Rights.\u00a0In 2009, when Moldova experienced its most\u00a0serious civil unrest\u00a0in a decade, several civilians, including\u00a0Valeriu Boboc, were killed and many more injured.<br \/>\nAccording to\u00a0Human Rights Report\u00a0of the\u00a0United States Department of State, released in April 2011, &#8220;In contrast to the previous year, there were no reports of killings by security forces. During the year reports of government exercising undue influence over the media substantially decreased.&#8221; But &#8220;Transnistrian authorities continued to harass independent media and opposition lawmakers; restrict freedom of association, movement, and religion; and discriminate against Romanian speakers.&#8221;\u00a0Moldova &#8220;has made noteworthy progress&#8221; on religious freedom since the era of the Soviet Union, but it can still take further steps to foster diversity,&#8221; said the\u00a0UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief\u00a0Heiner Bielefeldt, in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, in September 2011.\u00a0Moldova improved its legislation by enacting the\u00a0Law on Preventing and Combating Family Violence, in 2008.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GEOGRAPHY<br \/>\n<\/strong>Moldova lies between latitudes\u00a045\u00b0\u00a0and\u00a049\u00b0 N, and mostly between meridians\u00a026\u00b0\u00a0and\u00a030\u00b0 E\u00a0(a small area lies east of 30\u00b0). The total land area is 33,851\u00a0km2<br \/>\nThe largest part of the nation lies between two rivers, the\u00a0Dniester\u00a0and the\u00a0Prut. The western border of Moldova is formed by the Prut river, which joins the\u00a0Danube\u00a0before flowing into the\u00a0Black Sea. Moldova has access to the Danube for only about 480\u00a0m (1,575\u00a0ft), and\u00a0Giurgiule\u0219ti\u00a0is the only Moldovan port on the Danube. In the east, the Dniester is the main river, flowing through the country from north to south, receiving the waters of\u00a0R\u0103ut,\u00a0B\u00eec,\u00a0Ichel,\u00a0Botna.\u00a0Ialpug\u00a0flows into one of the Danube\u00a0limans, while\u00a0Cog\u00eelnic\u00a0into the Black Sea chain of limans.<br \/>\nThe country is landlocked, though it is close to the Black Sea. While most of the country is hilly, elevations never exceed 430\u00a0m \u2013 the highest point being the\u00a0B\u0103l\u0103ne\u0219ti Hill. Moldova&#8217;s hills are part of the Moldavian Plateau, which geologically originate from the\u00a0Carpathian Mountains. Its subdivisions in Moldova include the Dniester Hills (Northern Moldavian Hills and\u00a0Dniester Ridge), the Moldavian Plain (Middle Prut Valley and\u00a0B\u0103l\u021bi Steppe), and the Central Moldavian Plateau (Ciuluc-Solone\u021b Hills,\u00a0Corne\u0219ti Hills\u2014Codri\u00a0Massive, &#8220;Codri&#8221; meaning &#8220;forests&#8221;\u2014Lower Dniester Hills,\u00a0Lower Prut Valley, and\u00a0Tigheci Hills). In the south, the country has a small flatland, the\u00a0Bugeac Plain. The territory of Moldova east of the river Dniester is split between parts of the\u00a0Podolian Plateau, and parts of the\u00a0Eurasian Steppe.<br \/>\nThe country&#8217;s main cities are the capital Chi\u0219in\u0103u, in the centre of the country, Tiraspol (in the eastern region of Transnistria), B\u0103l\u021bi (in the north) and Bender (in the south-east).\u00a0Comrat\u00a0is the administrative centre of Gagauzia.<br \/>\n<strong>Climate.\u00a0<\/strong>Moldova has a climate which is moderately continental; its proximity to the\u00a0Black Sea\u00a0leads to the climate being mildly cold in the autumn and winter and relatively cool in the spring and summer.<br \/>\nThe summers are warm and long, with temperatures averaging about 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F) and the winters are relatively mild and dry, with January temperatures averaging \u22124\u00a0\u00b0C. Annual rainfall, which ranges from around 600\u00a0mm (24\u00a0in) in the north to 400\u00a0mm (16\u00a0in) in the south, can vary greatly; long dry spells are not unusual. The heaviest rainfall occurs in early summer and again in October; heavy showers and thunderstorms are common. Because of the irregular terrain, heavy summer rains often cause erosion and river silting.<br \/>\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Moldova was 41.5\u00a0\u00b0C (106.7\u00a0\u00b0F) on 21 July 2007 in\u00a0Camenca.\u00a0The lowest temperature ever recorded was \u221235.5\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221231.9\u00a0\u00b0F) on 20 January 1963 in Br\u0103tu\u0219eni, Edine\u021b county.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ECONOMY<br \/>\n<\/strong>After the breakup from the USSR in 1991, energy shortages, political uncertainty, trade obstacles and weak administrative capacity contributed to the decline of economy. As a part of an ambitious economic liberalization effort, Moldova introduced a convertible currency, liberalized all prices, stopped issuing preferential credits to state enterprises, backed steady land privatization, removed export controls, and liberalized interest rates. The government entered into agreements with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to promote growth. The economy reversed from decline in late 90&#8217;s. Since 1999 the GDP (PPP) has had a steady growth as follows:<br \/>\nAlthough estimates point to possible modest overvaluation of the real exchange rate, external competitiveness appears broadly adequate as reflected in strong sustained export performance.\u00a0However, the near-term economic outlook is weak. Main risks to the near-term outlook relate to serious vulnerabilities and governance issues in the banking sector, policy slippages in the run up to the elections, intensification of geopolitical tensions in the region, and a further slowdown in activity in main trading partners.<br \/>\nMoldova remains highly vulnerable to fluctuations in remittances from workers abroad (24 percent of GDP), exports to the\u00a0Commonwealth of Independent States\u00a0(CIS) and\u00a0European Union\u00a0(EU) (88 per cent of total exports), and donor support (about 10 per cent of government spending). The main transmission channels through which adverse exogenous shocks could impact the Moldovan economy are: remittances (also due to potentially returning migrants), external trade, and capital flows.<br \/>\nMoldova largely achieved the main objectives of the combined ECF\/EFF (IMF financial credit) supported program. The economy recovered from the drought-related contraction in 2012.<br \/>\nThe gross average monthly salary in the Republic of Moldova has registered a steady positive growth after 1999, being 5906 lei or 298 euros in 2018.<br \/>\nCorporate governance in the banking sector is a major concern. In line with FSAP recommendations, significant weaknesses in the legal and regulatory frameworks must be urgently addressed to ensure stability and soundness of the financial sector. Moldova has achieved a substantial degree of fiscal consolidation in recent years, but this trend is now reversing. Resisting pre-election pressures for selective spending increases and returning to the path of fiscal consolidation would reduce reliance on exceptionally-high donor support. Structural fiscal reforms would help safeguard sustainability.\u00a0Monetary policy has been successful in maintaining inflation within the NBM&#8217;s target range. The implementation of structural reforms outlined in the National Development Strategy (NDS) Moldova 2020\u2014especially in the business environment, physical infrastructure, and human resources development areas\u2014would help boost potential growth and reduce poverty.\u00a0Moldova&#8217;s remarkable recovery from the severe recession of 2009 was largely the result of sound macroeconomic and financial policies and structural reforms. Despite a small contraction in 2012, Moldova&#8217;s economic performance was among the strongest in the region during 2010\u201313. Economic activity grew cumulatively by about 24 percent; consumer price inflation was brought under control; and real wages increased cumulatively by about 13 percent. This expansion was made possible by adequate macroeconomic stabilization measures and ambitious structural reforms implemented in the wake of the crisis under a Fund-supported program. In November 2013, Moldova initialed an Association Agreement with the EU which includes provisions establishing a\u00a0Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area\u00a0(DCFTA).<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>The country<\/td>\n<td>Average monthly salary (euro) 2018<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Moldova<\/td>\n<td>298<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Romania<\/td>\n<td>966<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ukraine<\/td>\n<td>276<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Russia<\/td>\n<td>534<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>A political crisis in early 2013 led to policy slippages in the fiscal and financial areas. The political crisis that broke out in early 2013 was resolved with the appointment of a government supported by a pro-European center-right\/center coalition in May 2013. However, delays in policy implementation prevented completion of the final reviews under the ECF\/EFF arrangements.<br \/>\nDespite a sharp decline in poverty in recent years, Moldova remains one of the poorest countries in Europe and structural reforms are needed to promote sustainable growth. Based on the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) regional poverty line of US$5\/day (PPP), 55 percent of the population was poor in 2011. While this was significantly lower than 94 percent in 2002, Moldova&#8217;s poverty rate is still more than double the ECA average of 25 percent. The NDS\u2014Moldova (National Development System) 2020, which was published in November 2012, focuses on several critical areas to boost economic development and reduce poverty. These include education, infrastructure, financial sector, business climate, energy consumption, pension system, and judicial framework. Following the\u00a0regional financial crisis in 1998, Moldova has made significant progress towards achieving and retaining macroeconomic and financial stabilization. It has, furthermore, implemented many structural and institutional reforms that are indispensable for the efficient functioning of a market economy. These efforts have helped maintain macroeconomic and financial stability under difficult external circumstances, enabled the resumption of economic growth and contributed to establishing an environment conducive to the economy&#8217;s further growth and development in the medium term.<br \/>\nThe government&#8217;s goal of\u00a0EU integration\u00a0has resulted in some market-oriented progress. Moldova experienced better than expected economic growth in 2013 due to increased agriculture production, to economic policies adopted by the Moldovan government since 2009, and to the receipt of EU trade preferences connecting Moldovan products to the world&#8217;s largest market. Moldova has signed the\u00a0Association Agreement\u00a0and the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with the European Union during summer 2014.\u00a0Moldova has also achieved a Free Visa Regime\u00a0with the EU which represents the biggest achievement of Moldovan diplomacy since independence.\u00a0Still, growth has been hampered by high prices for Russian natural gas, a Russian import ban on Moldovan wine, increased foreign scrutiny of Moldovan agricultural products, and by Moldova&#8217;s large external debt. Over the longer term, Moldova&#8217;s economy remains vulnerable to political uncertainty, weak administrative capacity, vested bureaucratic interests, corruption, higher fuel prices, Russian pressure, and the separatist regime in Moldova&#8217;s Transnistria region.\u00a0According to IMF World Economic Outlook April 2014, the Moldovan GDP (PPP) per capita is 3,927 International Dollars,\u00a0excluding grey economy and tax evasion.<br \/>\n<strong>Energy. <\/strong>With few natural energy resources, Moldova imports almost all of its energy supplies from Russia and Ukraine. Moldova&#8217;s dependence on Russian energy is underscored by a growing US$5 billion debt to Russian natural gas supplier Gazprom, largely the result of unreimbursed natural gas consumption in the separatist Transnistria region. In August 2013, work began on a new pipeline between Moldova and Romania that may eventually break Russia&#8217;s monopoly on Moldova&#8217;s gas supplies.\u00a0Moldova is a partner country of the EU\u00a0INOGATE\u00a0energy programme, which has four key topics: enhancing\u00a0energy security,\u00a0convergence\u00a0of member state\u00a0energy markets\u00a0on the basis of\u00a0EU internal energy market\u00a0principles, supporting\u00a0sustainable energy\u00a0development, and attracting investment for energy projects of common and regional interest.<br \/>\n<strong>Wine industry.<\/strong><br \/>\nThe country has a well-established\u00a0wine\u00a0industry. It has a vineyard area of 147,000 hectares (360,000 acres), of which 102,500\u00a0ha (253,000 acres) are used for commercial production. Most of the country&#8217;s wine production is made for export. Many families have their own recipes and\u00a0grape varieties\u00a0that have been passed down through the generations.\u00a0Mile\u0219tii Mici\u00a0is the home of the largest wine cellar in the world. It stretches for 200\u00a0km and holds almost 2 million bottles of wine.<br \/>\n<strong>Agriculture. <\/strong>Moldova&#8217;s\u00a0rich soil\u00a0and\u00a0temperate\u00a0continental climate\u00a0(with warm summers and mild winters) have made the country one of the most productive agricultural regions since ancient times, and a major supplier of agricultural products in southeastern Europe. In agriculture, the economic reform started with the land cadastre reform.\u00a0Moldova&#8217;s\u00a0agricultural products include vegetables, fruits, grapes,\u00a0wine, and grains.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Transport<br \/>\n<\/strong>The main means of transportation in Moldova are railways 1,138\u00a0km (707\u00a0mi) and a highway system (12,730\u00a0km or 7,910\u00a0mi overall, including 10,937\u00a0km or 6,796\u00a0mi of paved surfaces). The sole international air gateway of Moldova is the\u00a0Chi\u0219in\u0103u International Airport. The\u00a0Giurgiule\u0219ti\u00a0terminal on the\u00a0Danube\u00a0is compatible with small seagoing vessels. Shipping on the lower\u00a0Prut\u00a0and\u00a0Nistru\u00a0rivers plays only a modest role in the country&#8217;s transportation system.<br \/>\n<strong>Telecommunications<br \/>\n<\/strong>The first million mobile telephone users were registered in September 2005. The number of mobile telephone users in Moldova increased by 47.3% in the first quarter of 2008 against the last year and exceeded 2.89 million.<br \/>\nIn September 2009, Moldova was the first country in the world to launch high-definition voice services (HD voice) for mobile phones, and the first country in Europe to launch 14.4 Mbit\/s mobile broadband on a national scale, with over 40% population coverage.<br \/>\nAs of 2010, there are around 1,295,000\u00a0Internet users in Moldova\u00a0with overall Internet penetration of 35.9%.<br \/>\nOn 6 June 2012, the Government approved the licensing of 4G \/ LTE for mobile operators.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DEMOGRAPHICS<br \/>\n<\/strong>As per\u00a02014 census\u00a0preliminary data, 2,998,235 inhabitants live in Moldova (within the areas controlled by the central government), an 11.3% decrease from the figure recorded at the 2004 census. The\u00a0urbanization\u00a0rate is 45% of the total population living in urban areas (as of 2015).<br \/>\nAccording to the last census in Transnistria (October 2015), the population of the region was 475,665, a 14.3% decrease from the figure recorded at the 2004 census. The\u00a0urbanization\u00a0rate was 69.9%.<br \/>\n<strong>Ethnic Composition.<\/strong><br \/>\nThe term &#8220;Moldavian&#8221; first came into use as a demonym for the inhabitants of the Moldavian Principality, established in 1359. In 1775, Austria annexed the northern part of the principality, from then on known as Bukovina; a second partition in 1812 resulted in the Russian Empire&#8217;s rule of the eastern part of Moldavia, known as\u00a0Bessarabia.<br \/>\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, what is now Moldova was populated by\u00a0Bulgarians,\u00a0Gagauz,\u00a0Poles,\u00a0Romanians,\u00a0Ukrainians,\u00a0Russians, along with a nomadic\u00a0Nogai\u00a0Tatar\u00a0population. A Moldavian identity prevailed in Bessarabia into the interwar period, whereas a Romanian one had developed among ethnic Romanians in Bukovina even before the Great Union. Peasants in all three parts: Romanian, Austrian, and Russian, of historic Moldavia were more likely to identify as Moldavians than were urban residents.<br \/>\nAccording to the last\u00a0Moldovan Census (2014)\u00a0(excluding Transnistria):<\/p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Self-identification in 2014<\/td>\n<td>Population<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Moldovans<\/td>\n<td>75.1%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Romanians<\/td>\n<td>7.0%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ukrainians<\/td>\n<td>6.6%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gagauz<\/td>\n<td>4.6%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Russians<\/td>\n<td>4.1%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bulgarians<\/td>\n<td>1.9%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Romani<\/td>\n<td>0.3%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Others<\/td>\n<td>0.4%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TOTAL<\/td>\n<td>\u00a0\u00a0100%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>Density of population per km2, depending on administrative unit<br \/>\nAccording to the\u00a02004 Moldovan Census\u00a0(areas controlled by the central government), and the\u00a02004 Census in Transnistria\u00a0(areas controlled by the breakaway authorities, including Transnistria,\u00a0Bender\/Tighina, and four neighbouring communes):<br \/>\n<strong>Languages<br \/>\n<\/strong>The official language of Moldova is\u00a0Romanian, a\u00a0Romance language\u00a0related to Italian, French, Spanish, and Portuguese.<br \/>\nThe 1991\u00a0Declaration of Independence\u00a0names the official language Romanian.\u00a0The\u00a0Constitution of 1994\u00a0stated that the national language of the Republic of Moldova was\u00a0Moldovan, and its writing is based on the\u00a0Latin alphabet.<br \/>\nIn 2003, the\u00a0Communist government\u00a0adopted a political document which states that one of the priorities of the national politics of the Republic of Moldova is preservation of the Moldovan language.\u00a0In December 2013, a decision of the\u00a0Constitutional Court of Moldova\u00a0ruled that the Declaration of Independence takes precedence over the Constitution, and the state language is &#8220;Romanian&#8221;.<br \/>\nAt the\u00a02014 census\u00a0(which did not include data from the\u00a0Transnistrian region), 54.6% of the population named Moldovan whereas 24.0% named Romanian as their first language in daily use. Although only 4.1% are ethnic Russians, Russian is still used as the main language by 14.5% of the total population. Around 50% of ethnic Ukrainians, 33% of Gagauz, 33% of Bulgarians, and 5.7% of Moldovans declared Russian as their daily use language.<br \/>\nHistorically Russian was taught in schools as the first foreign language, because of the relationship with the Russian Empire and Soviet Union. In the 21st century, the primary foreign language taught in the schools is English. In 2013 more than 60% of schoolchildren took it as their first foreign language. This was followed by\u00a0French, taken by less than 50% of students. Since 1996, the Republic of Moldova has been a full member of\u00a0La Francophonie.\u00a0German\u00a0was the third-ranked choice.<br \/>\n<strong>Religion<br \/>\n<\/strong>For the 2004 census,\u00a0Orthodox Christians, who make up 93.3% of Moldova&#8217;s population, were not required to declare the particular of the two main churches they belong to.

Located geographically at the crossroads of\u00a0Latin,\u00a0Slavic\u00a0and other cultures, Moldova has enriched its own culture adopting and maintaining traditions of neighbouring regions and of other influential sources.\u00a0The largest ethnic group, which had come to identify itself widely as &#8220;Moldovan&#8221; by the 14th century, played a significant role in the shaping of\u00a0classical Romanian culture. The culture has been also influenced by the\u00a0Byzantine\u00a0culture, the neighbouring Magyar and Slavic populations, and later by the Ottoman Turks. A strong Western European influence in Moldovan literature and arts was prevalent in the 19th century. During the periods 1812-1917 and 1944\u201389, Moldovans were influenced by Russian and Soviet administrative control as well and by ethnic Russian immigration.<br \/>\nThe country&#8217;s cultural heritage was marked by numerous churches and monasteries built by the Moldavian ruler\u00a0Stephen the Great\u00a0in the 15th century, by the works of the later renaissance Metropolitans\u00a0Varlaam\u00a0and\u00a0Dosoftei, and those of scholars such as\u00a0Grigore Ureche,\u00a0Miron Costin,\u00a0Nicolae Milescu,\u00a0Dimitrie Cantemir\u00a0and\u00a0Ion Neculce. In the 19th century, Moldavians from the territories of the medieval Principality of\u00a0Moldavia, divided into\u00a0Bessarabia,\u00a0Bukovina, and\u00a0Western Moldavia\u00a0(after 1859, Romania), made a significant contribution to the formation of the modern Romanian culture. Among these were many Bessarabians, such as\u00a0Alexandru Donici,\u00a0Alexandru H\u00e2jdeu,\u00a0Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu,\u00a0Constantin Stamati,\u00a0Constantin Stamati-Ciurea,\u00a0Costache Negruzzi,\u00a0Alecu Russo,\u00a0Constantin Stere.<br \/>\nMihai Eminescu, a late\u00a0Romantic\u00a0poet, and\u00a0Ion Creang\u0103, a writer, are the most influential\u00a0Romanian language\u00a0artists, considered national writers both in Romania and Moldova.<br \/>\nThe country has also important minority ethnic communities. Gagauz, 4.4% of the population, are\u00a0Christian\u00a0Turkic\u00a0people.\u00a0Greeks,\u00a0Armenians,\u00a0Poles, Ukrainians, although not numerous, were present since as early as the 17th century, and had left cultural marks. The 19th century saw the arrival of many more Ukrainians from\u00a0Podolia\u00a0and\u00a0Galicia, as well as new communities, such as\u00a0Lipovans,\u00a0Bulgarians, and\u00a0Germans.<br \/>\n<strong>Cuisine. <\/strong>Moldovan cuisine is similar to neighbouring\u00a0Romania, and has been influenced by elements of\u00a0Russian,\u00a0Turkish, and\u00a0Ukrainian cuisine. Main dishes include\u00a0beef,\u00a0pork,\u00a0potatoes,\u00a0cabbage, and a variety of\u00a0cereals. Popular alcoholic beverages are\u00a0divin\u00a0(Moldovan\u00a0brandy),\u00a0beer, and local\u00a0wine.<br \/>\nTotal recorded adult alcohol consumption is approximately evenly split between spirits, beer and wine.<br \/>\n<strong>Holidays. <\/strong>Most retail businesses close on\u00a0New Year&#8217;s Day\u00a0and\u00a0Independence Day, but remain open on all other holidays.\u00a0Christmas\u00a0is celebrated either on 7 January, the traditional date in\u00a0Old Calendarists\u00a0Eastern Orthodox Churches, or on 25 December, with both dates being recognized as public holidays.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SPORTS<br \/>\n<\/strong>Tr\u00eent\u0103\u00a0(a form of\u00a0wrestling) is the national sport in Moldova.\u00a0Association football\u00a0is the most popular team sport.<br \/>\nRugby union\u00a0is popular as well. Registered players have doubled, and almost 10,000 spectators turn up at every\u00a0European Nations Cup\u00a0match.\u00a0The most prestigious\u00a0cycling race\u00a0is the\u00a0Moldova President&#8217;s Cup, which was first run in 2004.<br \/>\nAthletes from Moldova have won European medals in\u00a0Athletics,\u00a0Biathlon,\u00a0Football\u00a0and\u00a0Gymnastics, World medals in\u00a0Archery,\u00a0Judo,\u00a0Swimming\u00a0and\u00a0Taekwondo, as well as\u00a0Olympic\u00a0medals in\u00a0Boxing,\u00a0Canoeing,\u00a0Shooting,\u00a0Weightlifting\u00a0and\u00a0Wrestling.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>OBSERVATIONS 1.
