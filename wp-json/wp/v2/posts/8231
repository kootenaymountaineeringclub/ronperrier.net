To the Slocan Bluffs, Kinnaird and Penticton\u2019s Skaha you can add Castlegar\u2019s Waterline Wall.<br \/>\nWith the help of Kootenay climbing veteran Hamish Mutch, the new climbing area has been bolted and mapped, with more routes to come\u2026 t\u2019s 7:30 in the morning and Neil Ives and I are at the new Waterline Wall climbing area watching a family of wild turkeys forage in the field next to us. I mention that it\u2019s hard to believe we\u2019re a mere two-minute drive from downtown Castlegar and he replies, \u201cThat\u2019s what sets this area apart from others in the Kootenays \u2013 the access is really easy but it\u2019s got a sort of remote feel to it.\u201d<br \/>\nIves is one of four developers who have been busy this past year putting up new routes at the Wall, which is named for the utility water line that runs under the access trail. This gravel trail is actually a city \u201cright of way\u201d and it links the two halves of 14th Avenue, just west of Castlegar\u2019s Columbia Street. In years past it has been a popular destination for birdwatchers, dog walkers and cross-country skiers but it wasn\u2019t until the fall of 2006 that climbers began to visit regularly. That year, three Selkirk College students (Aaron Kristiansen, Kyle Ridge and Ives) and Hamish Mutch, a Kootenay climbing veteran, began developing in earnest, cleaning vegetation off the cliff, which is located on property owned by a Salmon Arm holding company, and bolting sport climbs. The area had seen some ascents decades earlier when mountaineers practiced placing pitons in the more obvious cracks, but it wasn\u2019t until Kristiansen was introduced to the cliff by an aviation student, who spotted it while on a flight, that interest really took off. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe this area hadn\u2019t been developed already, considering the quality of rock and the easy access\u201d, says Ives.<br \/>\nThere are now 46 routes on six walls that range from easy traditional crack climbs to harder sport projects in the 5.12 range. The variety of climbing at Waterline is only partly responsible for the exponential increase of climber visitations in the past few months, however. \u201cSince we put out the guide book to help offset the cost of bolting, this place has gone off\u201d, Ives says. The 24-page guide costs $10 and the proceeds go towards hardware, which, given the cost of bolts, hangers, chains and drill bits, averages out to $85 per route. There are still many more lines to be developed at Waterline Wall and Ives says the increase in popularity will only spur him and the others to create more. \u201cThis place is fresh out of the oven\u201d, he says, \u201cand we still have a lot more to do.\u201d<br \/>\nWATERLINE WHEREABOUTS Drive West from Castlegar on Hwy 3 toward Grand Forks. Turn left on 14th Ave and drive to the end past the baseball diamond. Follow the dirt road and park on the left. The first wall is 200 metres past the gate.<br \/>\nGuidebooks are available at The Powderhound in Rossland, the Chamber of Commerce in Castlegar and Valhalla Pure Outfitters in Nelson.<br \/>\nThe following information was submitted by Hamish Mutch. &#8220;This area [Castlegar\u2019s Waterline Wall] is very popular. Close to 200 guidebooks have sold in the last few months. Sometimes as many as 30 people come there on a weekend. KMC members Hamish Mutch, Kyle Ridge, Doug Brown and Dave Jack have been very active there, and have participated in establishing 16 of the 48 routes now recorded. Stephen Langley, Daniele Montandon, Linda Johannson and Sandra McGuinness are also frequent visitors.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK Forty Six New Routes, Two Minutes From Downtown, By Vince Hempsall.
