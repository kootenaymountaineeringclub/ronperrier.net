You can drive in through the narrow gate and park inside. The main attraction is an atmospheric restaurant with small barrel-vaulted rooms and a large room with outdoor tables overlooking the river. The bastions are blocked off. There is also another new stone building inside. Free<br \/>\n<strong>Ferhat Pasha Mosque.<\/strong> Built by Ferhad Pasha Sokolovi\u0107 (of a wealthy Bosnian family, the most famous member was Mehmed Pasha Sokolivi\u0107, the vizier to 3 sultans; he also built 200 shops, owned land, a caravanserai, market, hamam, mill, medina and clock tower) in 1579This small intimate mosque has Persian carpets, lovely green\/blue\/yellow geometric stained glass windows, marble mihrab, grill and columns and a wildly colourful apse.<br \/>\nOutside are three turbe (mausoleums) to Ferhat and other family members that are closed but you can look in the windows to see the wood coffins. I washed my feet in the ablution fountain.<br \/>\n<strong>Museum of Contemporary Art of the Republic of Srpska<\/strong>.

After WW II, a monument to fallen soldiers was built on the site but the actual church was not rebuilt until 1993 taking 16 years. Outside it is a lovely pink\/yellow striped building with gold domes, one large central dome and 4 smaller ones on the corners. Carved marble arches with mosaics are over the doors. Inside it is a smaller square church with beautiful mosaics (not murals) in the side transepts and dome (with nice gold sun rays designs surrounding the central main subjects). An intricately carved wood iconoclast, marble columns with capitals and a great brass chandelier complete the lovely space.

One of 4 Roman Catholic cathedrals in B&amp;H was built in 1970-73 after the original was damaged in an earthquake. It was again damaged in the Bosnian War but was repaired in 2001. St Bonaventure was a Franciscan theologian from the Middle Ages.

I slept at a sports hall with good, free wifi. Badly in need of a shower, the security guard was unusually vigilant but the Olympic Swimming pool in Banya Luca had great showers. M16, the road between Banya Luca and Jajca followed the spectacular Vrbas River \u2013 narrow with steep limestone walls. After aggressively passing 5 cars and 2 large trucks, the twisty road was a fast drive. Upstream in a reservoir, I have never seen so much garbage in a river\/lake \u2013 rafts of floating plastic sometimes covering half the river. The sides of the roads were a little better.<br \/>\nI had decided on a very circuitous route to Zagreb that would be almost impossible to follow in these posts as I went back and forth between the two areas.
