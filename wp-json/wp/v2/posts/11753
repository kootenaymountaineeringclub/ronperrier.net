It was a crucial aspect of Germany&#8217;s industrialization during the 20<sup>th<\/sup> century. At its peak, 17,000 people worked here. Initially, it produced steel for railway tracks and later developed steel girders for building construction. By-products of iron production, such as fertilizer and tar, were an essential part of the business. During WW II, it was involved in armament production, including helmets, and after the war, it produced much of the steel necessary to rebuild Germany.<br \/>\nIn 1994, it became the first industrial site in any country to be designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Today, it is an active museum showcasing the making of iron and offering tours of the production areas, a jungle of pipes, metal tracks, huge silos, chimneys, and metal structures. There are more than 6 kilometres of pathways that can be explored independently, including the sintering shed, burden shed, and coking plant. A must is climbing to the top of the platform. There are also constantly changing art and history exhibits. \u20ac17<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mi\" src=\"https:\/\/expertvagabond.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/saarland-volklinger-factory-XL-1.jpg\" alt=\"Search results for &quot;V\u00f6lklingen Ironworks.&quot;\" width=\"634\" height=\"422\" \/><br \/>\n<a class=\"irc_mutl i3597\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.ca\/url?sa=i&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;ved=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FAbandonedPorn%2Fcomments%2Faoskld%2Fthe_v%25C3%25B6lklingen_iron_works_is_a_unesco_heritage%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw0wYRzdF3ijZeEtwZrLu-eS&amp;ust=1568526556036025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-noload=\"\" data-ved=\"2ahUKEwi5kv2az8_kAhVlMewKHex7BEcQjRx6BAgBEAQ\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"irc_mut\" src=\"https:\/\/encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com\/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQeX1Se4a1OvU8l_xkQCaXXvT7fw7fSYzRlNU2BfAvkjJJTAjPNxg\" alt=\"Search results for &quot;V\u00f6lklingen Ironworks.&quot;\" width=\"458\" height=\"611\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Germany \u2013 Saarland (Saarbr\u00fccken) September 12, 2019 V\u00f6lklingen Ironworks.
