It exploded as an industrial and mercantile hub initially built on wool and then on metalworking from the 16<sup>th<\/sup> century. The Lunar Society brought together the leading geologists, chemists, scientists, engineers, and theorists of the mid-18<sup>th<\/sup> century and Birmingham became the world\u2019s first industrialized town, attracting workers from all over Britain.<br \/>\nAt the same time, the slums were cleaned out and the center was filled with grand civic buildings. Later WWII and attempts made to transform it into Britain\u2019s Motor City took their toll on the center. Recently regeneration is proceeding at break-neck speed.<br \/>\nThe best civic buildings are around Victoria Square \u2013 Council House, a fountain nicknamed floozy in the Jacuzzi, and a statue of Queen Victoria. In the west, Centenary Square has the Hall of Memory War Memorial, the International Convention Centre, Symphony Hall, the Library of Birmingham, and a statue of its leading lights, Matthew Boulton, James Watt, and William Murdoch.<br \/>\n<strong>Library of Birmingham.<\/strong> This architectural triumph has a spiraling interior, viewing decks, and 7th-floor\u00a0secret garden with views over the city.

His son, Abraham Darby II invented a new forging process for producing single beams of iron. This allowed his son, #III, to construct in 1779-81, the world\u2019s first iron bridge spanning the River Severn. The bridge (now undergoing significant renovation) is the focal point of 10 different museums that tell the story of the Industrial Revolution in the buildings where it took place.<br \/>\nAt the time of construction, no one could believe that anything so large \u2013 it weighs 384 tons \u2013 could be built from cast iron without collapsing under its own weight. Now covered in scaffolding with windows for viewing the ironwork, several dioramas detail the work being done to preserve the bridge. Coupled with the museum in the toll booth, there is great information. The bridge hasn\u2019t carried traffic since 1980 and has a gravel bridge deck. This is Unesco-listed.

Of the 350 people who lived there, 260 died. The museum has an excellent display of the plague and a lot of ancillary Eyam history. See my post on the plague for details of how it affected the world.<br \/>\nThe first recorded plague was the Justinian Plague in the 6th and 7th centuries which spread from Eastern Europe to North Africa and throughout the Roman Empire.<br \/>\nThe second pandemic called the Black Death entered Europe from the Far East and occurred primarily from 1347-50. It entered England at Dorset from trading ships and was in London by the spring of 1649. Yorkshire had 1000 villages depopulated. Of the 3-4 million people living in England then, half died. Labour became scarce and workers were freed from the medieval system of labour when Lords were forced to grant better working conditions. Outbreaks after 1650 still occurred for the next 30 years but were less violent and the last epidemic in London was in 1665.<br \/>\nMost of Western Europe was plague-free after 1700 and the last epidemic occurred in Germany in 1707.<br \/>\nThe Third World epidemic spread from Hong Kong and lasted between 1898-1948. There were 12.5 million deaths in India.<br \/>\nAn interesting display in Eyam described the effect of the mutation Delta 32 &#8211; where there are fewer receptors on the macrophage that bind the Yersinia pestis bacteria. The mutation is present in about 10% of Europeans with a high of 14% in Sweden. It confers relative immunity to the infection and explains some of the survival rates.<br \/>\n\u00a32 concession<\/p>\n<p><strong>BAKEWELL<\/strong> (pop 4,000).<br \/>\nThe second largest town in the Peak District, it is filled with stone buildings and is ringed with walking trails.<br \/>\n<strong>All Saints Church.<\/strong> High up on the hill above town, it is the original Norman building with a tall stone spire and a graveyard full of 1800s graves.

He harnessed two creeks and built two mills run by a sunken water wheel and then a culvert to take the water \u00bd mile downstream. He is called the \u201cFather of the Factory System\u201d. He provided homes for his workers \u2013 the men weaved it by hand at home. By 1789, there were 1100 workers at Cromford.
