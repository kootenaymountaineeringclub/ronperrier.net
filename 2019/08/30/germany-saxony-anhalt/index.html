In the 10<sup>th</sup> century, it was the ancestral seat of the first German king, Heinrich I. The imperial and royal holidays were held here.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Quedlinburg Abbey.</strong> Founded in 936 by Empress Mathilde, the convent was established as an educational institution and home for the daughters of the aristocracy, providing a religious upbringing combined with intellectual development. Mathilde headed it, followed in 966 by her granddaughter Mathilde, who became the first abbess. It was not a convent, but the women were allowed to keep their material possessions and function like normal women. The convent was dissolved in 1803, ruled by 39 abbesses and one prioress.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>The Collegiate Church</strong> (Stiftskirche) of St. Servatius is one of the oldest churches in Germany, dating back to 1129. Heinrich was buried in a small chapel on the hill, near the crypt of the church. In 936, upon his death, his widow, Queen Mathilde, founded an imperial collegiate for noble ladies governed by an abbess. A lightning fire in 1070 burnt down the 3<sup>rd</sup> basilica completely. This 4<sup>th</sup> building was erected in Romanesque style with 3-naves, a flat ceiling, thick walls, small windows, and mighty pillars and columns (the Saxon style was two columns followed by one pillar with 12 columns (the 12 apostles) and four pillars (the four evangelists). The apse was replaced by a Gothic choir in 1320, and in 1938, a new apse was built into the choir by the Nazis (they believed Heinrich I was the founder of the “Thousand Year Reich” and used the church as a Germanic Hall to celebrate SS meetings). It was painted entirely (no longer present) and decorated with symbolic Middle Age capitals and friezes (raisin, ribbon, eagle, monk and a knight on the last column—paintings of saints under a cross in the choir date from 1480.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Treasury</strong>.

The pieces are fantastic, gem-encrusted, ivory, and gold: reliquaries of Heinrich (also his comb), St. Servatius (also his crozier), an alabaster jar, crystal reliquary jars, a Samuhel Bible, wood shrines, and many more reliquary objects.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Crypt</strong>.

Gernrode was founded in 959 and was disestablished in the seventeenth century. In the Middle Ages, the abbey was an Imperial abbey that had the status of imperial immediacy. Located on the north-eastern edge of the Harz Mountains.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"></sup> The abbey and its collegiate church, Saint Cyriakus, were thus dedicated to Cyriakus, <sup id="cite_ref-Stokstad_6-0" class="reference"></sup>and became a centre for his cult.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"></sup>From its foundation, the abbesses and provosts of Gernrode were drawn from members of noble German dynasties, including the Billung, Ascanier, and the House of Wettin. Initially, there were places for 24 noblewomen at Gernrode. Together, the nuns and canonesses of Gernrode and Frose made up the convent. Like the abbesses of Quedlinburg, Gandersheim, Essen and Vreden, the abbesses of Gernrode were imperial princes, who each had their seat at imperial assemblies.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"></sup>Over time, particularly from the thirteenth century onwards, Gernrode lost its former influence due to mismanagement by abbesses, the general economic situation, and the local bishops&#8217; political influence. By 1544, the possessions of the abbey consisted only of the town of Gernrode and five villages. By the early seventeenth century, the abbey&#8217;s possessions covered around two square miles.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The Reformation began during the abbacy of Elizabeth of Weida, and from 1545, Protestant worship was introduced at Gernrode. The abbey was turned into a Protestant convent. The last abbess of Gernrode, Sophie Elisabeth, left the abbey in 1614 to marry. The princes of Anhalt refused to appoint a new abbess and completed the incorporation of Gernrode into their territory.<br /> </span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><noscript><img decoding="async" class="irc_mi" src="https://photos.wikimapia.org/p/00/00/37/36/49_big.jpg" alt="Image result for Gernrode Abbey," width="635" height="494" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload irc_mi" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20635%20494%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://photos.wikimapia.org/p/00/00/37/36/49_big.jpg" alt="Image result for Gernrode Abbey," width="635" height="494" /></span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>MARTIN LUTHER </strong>(10 November 1483<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"></sup>– 18 February 1546) was a German professor of theology, composer, priest, monk,<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"></sup> and a seminal figure in the Protestant Reformation.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Luther was ordained to the priesthood in 1507. He came to reject several teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic Church, in particular, disputing the view on indulgences. Luther proposed an academic discussion of the practice and efficacy of indulgences in his <i>Ninety-five Theses</i> of 1517. His refusal to renounce all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Holy Roman Emperor.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Luther taught that salvation and, consequently, eternal life are not earned by good deeds but are received as a gift of God&#8217;s grace through the believer&#8217;s faith in Jesus Christ as the redeemer from sin. His theology challenged the authority and office of the Pope by teaching that the Bible is the only source of divinely revealed knowledge. <sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"></sup>And opposed sacerdotalism by considering all baptized Christians to be a holy priesthood. <sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"></sup>Those who identify with these teachings, as well as Luther&#8217;s broader teachings, are called Lutherans. However, Luther insisted on <i>Christian</i> or <i>Evangelical</i> (German: <i>evangelisch</i>) as the only acceptable names for individuals who professed Christ.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">His translation of the Bible into the German vernacular (instead of Latin) made it more accessible to the laity, an event that had a tremendous impact on both the church and German culture. It fostered the development of a standard version of the German language, added several principles to the art of translation, and influenced the writing of an English translation, the Tyndale Bible. <sup id="cite_ref-Tyndale_7-0" class="reference"></sup>His hymns influenced the development of singing in Protestant churches.<sup id="cite_ref-Bainton269_8-0" class="reference"></sup> His marriage to Katharina von Bora, a former nun, set a model for the practice of clerical marriage, allowing Protestant clergy to marry.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><sup id="cite_ref-Bainton223_9-0" class="reference"></sup>In two of his later works, Luther expressed antagonistic views towards Jews.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"></sup> His rhetoric was not directed at Jews alone, but also towards Roman Catholics, Anabaptists, and nontrinitarian Christians. <sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"></sup>Luther died in 1546, with Pope Leo X&#8217;s excommunication still in effect.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>EISLEBEN<br /> </strong>First mentioned in 994, the city was tied to the Counts of Mansfeld in the 13<sup>th</sup> century.

Luther suffered a heart attack on January 28, 1546 and died on February 18. He was a strong anti-Semite as he saw them as enemies of the faith who had to be converted or expelled. He delivered an anti-Jewish sermon in St Andrew’s church just before he died, blaming them for his heart attack.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The actual house in which he died was demolished (except for a house mark) in 1570 and recreated between 1865 and 1869. This house was the first Luther memorial site. A place of remembrance gradually evolved into a museum, although nothing from the original period survived. He was buried in All Saints’ church in Wittenberg.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The house sits across the street from St Andrews. €5, 4 reduction with birthplace ticket</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Martin Luther&#8217;s Birth House.</strong> He was born in a small apartment in Eisleben on November 10, 1483, and baptized the next day at the parish church of St. Peter. A few months later, his family moved to Mansfeld. Luther’s father is a smelter and well-off, so he was able to give his children a good education. He joined the Augustinian Monastery in Erfurt in 1505. Luther is married and has six children, four of whom have reached adulthood, living in Wittenberg. In 1819, the house became the Luther Charity School, with 130 pupils, and later added teacher education. €5, 4 with a dual ticket from the birth house.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>St. Peter and Paul Church.</strong> The interior appears to have been recently renovated, featuring white walls, stone fluted pillars, stone ribs that terminate in rosettes of heraldic crests, and new pews with padding.

Construction of the early Romanesque cathedral was completed between 1015 and 1021. However, the eastern part of the building collapsed twice within a few years and had to be rebuilt, opening in 1042. Despite later construction, this early Romanesque structure continues to influence the appearance of today&#8217;s cathedral. The hall crypt is one of the oldest, mostly unchanged structures of this type in Germany. <sup id="cite_ref-Booklet_1-1" class="reference"></sup>Around the middle of the 12th century, the western towers were rebuilt. The earlier quarry stone masonry was replaced by masonry made from worked stones. Many additions were made in the following 200 years. The old nave was demolished in 1510, and the new nave was built between 1510 and 1511. Since the Reformation, the cathedral has not been the seat of a bishop. Martin Luther gave a sermon here in August 1545. Renovations aimed at restoring the &#8220;original&#8221; look of the church took place in 1839, 1844/5 and 1883-6.

Francke Foundations are today a modern educational cosmos closely connected with their history.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">In the former outskirts of Halle, in Glaucha, August Hermann Francke established a school for deprived and orphan children. He elaborated an extensive, religiously motivated educational concept and started, initially without a steady income and without capital, to establish social-educational institutions for each class of society. Within only 30 years, it developed into a unique school city with a teacher training institution, business enterprises such as a pharmacy and a publishing house, and scientific collections.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Today, the Francke Foundations feel bound to a double heritage: the responsibility for the salvation and lasting preservation of the building ensemble and the historical collections, as well as the task of continuing the ideas and traditions of their founder into the future. Since the revival of the Foundations in 1992, institutions with close connections to Francke&#8217;s ideas and work have been established in the historical buildings. With their 40 partner institutions the Foundations are today a unique centre of cultural, scientific, educational, social and Christian institutions, a complex with three kindergartens, children’s creativity centre, four schools, a House of Generations, a youth workshop, a bible centre, traditional commercial enterprises, archives, libraries, museums, university and non-university research facilities and much more. Today, more than 4,000 people learn, teach, work and live in the Francke Foundations.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Halle-Neustadt</strong>: Socialist Buildings Popularly known as HaNeu, this was a city in the GDR established in May 1967 as an independent city. The population in 1972 was 51,600, and in 1981, it had increased to 93,000. In 1990, it merged back into Halle. The population has halved since then. It was praised for being sustainable, featuring high density, a tram line serving the central corridor, and a suburban rail system. Infrastructure (hotels, department stores) was not provided, and it was a bedroom community. The tram line was not built.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">It extends east-west for approximately 4 kilometres and is 1 kilometre wide. Virtually all housing is high-rise, with some towers reaching 11 stories, but many are medium-rise buildings without elevators. There are many buildings, some of which have been gutted, while the private sector is redeveloping others. A shopping mall has also been developed in the middle. Parking was on the east fringe for those few who were privileged enough to own a car, but is now provided adjacent to the apartments.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>BARHAUS and its SITES in WIEMAR and DESSAU </strong></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The Staatliches Bauhaus, commonly known as the Bauhaus, was a German art school operating from 1919 to 1933 that combined crafts and the fine arts, and was renowned for the design approach it promoted and taught.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Walter Gropius founded the Bauhaus in Weimar. The German term <i>Bauhaus</i>—literally &#8220;building house&#8221;—was understood as meaning &#8220;School of Building&#8221;, but despite its name and the fact that its founder was an architect, the Bauhaus did not initially have an architecture department. Nonetheless, it was founded upon the idea of creating a Gesamtkunstwerk (&#8220;total work of art&#8221;) in which all the arts, including architecture, would eventually be brought together. The Bauhaus style later became one of the most influential currents in modern design, as well as in Modernist architecture, art, and architectural education.<sup id="cite_ref-archdic_2-0" class="reference"></sup> The Bauhaus movement had a profound influence upon subsequent developments in art, architecture, graphic design, interior design, industrial design, and typography.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"></sup>The school existed in three German cities—Weimar, from 1919 to 1925; Dessau, from 1925 to 1932; and Berlin, from 1932 to 1933—under three different architect-directors: Walter Gropius from 1919 to 1928; Hannes Meyer from 1928 to 1930; and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe from 1930 until 1933, when the school was closed by its leadership under pressure from the Nazi regime, having been painted as a centre of communist intellectualism. Although the school was closed, the staff continued to spread its idealistic precepts as they emigrated from Germany to all over the world.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"></sup>The changes of venue and leadership resulted in a constant shifting of focus, technique, instructors, and politics. For example, the pottery shop was discontinued when the school relocated from Weimar to Dessau, despite having been a significant source of revenue.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The Bauhaus style, also known as the International Style, is characterized by the absence of ornamentation and by harmony between the function of an object or building and its design. However, the most important influence on Bauhaus was modernism, the radically simplified forms, the rationality and functionality, and the idea that mass production was reconcilable with the individual artistic spirit—many fundamental questions of craftsmanship versus mass production, the relationship of usefulness and beauty, the practical purpose of formal beauty in a commonplace object,</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><span id="Weimar" class="mw-headline">Weimar. </span></strong>The school was founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar on April 12, 1919 and was directed by Belgian Art Nouveau architect Henry van de Velde. <sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"></sup>When van de Velde was forced to resign in 1915 because he was Belgian, he suggested Gropius.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><em>The main building of the Bauhaus-University Weimar.</em> Built between 1904 and 1911 and designed by Henry van de Velde to house the sculptors’ studio at the Grand Ducal Saxon Art School, it was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Gropius&#8217; style in architecture and consumer goods emphasized functionality, affordability, and consistency with mass production.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Dessau.</strong> Gropius&#8217;s design for the Dessau facilities was a return to the futuristic Gropius of 1914, which had more in common with the International Style lines of the Fagus Factory. Meyer became director when Gropius resigned in February 1928,<sup id="cite_ref-Artists_2009_pp._64-66_1-1" class="reference"></sup> and brought the Bauhaus its two most significant building commissions, both of which still exist: five apartment buildings in the city of Dessau, and the Bundesschule des Allgemeinen Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes (ADGB Trade Union School) in Bernau bei Berlin.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span id="Berlin" class="mw-headline">The Dessau building is white, flat-roofed, and has a facade that is entirely glass, with small panes. Although the building is 100 years old, it still appears and feels remarkably modern. €6<br /> <strong>Berlin. </strong></span>In late 1932, Mies rented a derelict factory in Berlin to use as the new Bauhaus with his own money. The students and faculty rehabilitated the building, painting the interior white. The school operated for ten months without further interference from the Nazi Party. In 1933, the Gestapo closed down the Berlin school. <sup id="cite_ref-Mies_23-1" class="reference"></sup>Although neither the Nazi Party nor Adolf Hitler had a cohesive architectural policy before they came to power in 1933, they labelled the Bauhaus &#8220;un-German&#8221;. It criticized its modernist styles, deliberately generating public controversy over issues like flat roofs. Increasingly through the early 1930s, they characterized the Bauhaus as a front for communists and social liberals. Indeed, several communist students loyal to Meyer moved to the Soviet Union when he was fired in 1930.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Emigrants did succeed, however, in spreading the concepts of the Bauhaus to other countries, including the &#8220;New Bauhaus&#8221; of Chicago. Mies decided to emigrate to the United States to become the director of the School of Architecture at the Armour Institute (now the Illinois Institute of Technology) in Chicago and to seek building commissions. <sup id="ref_fn_1a" class="reference"></sup>The straightforward, engineering-oriented functionalism of stripped-down modernism, however, did lead to some Bauhaus influences persisting in Nazi Germany. In 1935, when the new autobahn (highways) in 1935, many of the bridges and service stations were &#8220;bold examples of modernism&#8221;—among those submitting designs was Mies van der Rohe.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"></sup><strong>Architecture.</strong> The paradox of the early Bauhaus was that, although its manifesto proclaimed that the aim of all creative activity was building, The school did not offer classes in architecture until 1927. During the years under Gropius (1919–1927), he and his partner Adolf Meyer observed no fundamental difference. The building output of Bauhaus architecture during these years is primarily the work of Gropius: the Sommerfeld house in Berlin, the Otte house in Berlin, the Auerbach house in Jena, and the competition design for the Chicago Tribune Tower, which brought the school considerable attention. The definitive 1926 Bauhaus building in Dessau is also attributed to Gropius. Apart from contributions to the 1923 Haus am Horn, student architectural work consisted of unbuilt projects, interior finishes, and craftwork, including cabinets, chairs, and pottery.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">In the next two years under Meyer, the architectural focus shifted away from aesthetics and towards functionality. There were major commissions: one from the city of Dessau for five tightly designed &#8220;Laubenganghäuser&#8221; (apartment buildings with balcony access), which are still in use today, and another for the Bundesschule des Allgemeinen Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes (ADGB Trade Union School) in Bernau bei Berlin. Neither Mies van der Rohe nor his Bauhaus students saw any projects built during the 1930s.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The popular conception of the Bauhaus as the source of extensive Weimar-era housing projects is not entirely accurate. Two projects, the apartment building project in Dessau and the Törten row housing project also in Dessau, fall into that category; however, developing worker housing was not a priority for Gropius or Mies. It was the Bauhaus contemporaries Bruno Taut, Hans Poelzig, and, particularly, Ernst May, as the city architects of Berlin, Dresden, and Frankfurt, respectively, who are rightfully credited with the thousands of socially progressive housing units built in Weimar Germany. The housing Taut built in south-west Berlin during the 1920s, close to the U-Bahn stop Onkel Toms Hütte, is still occupied.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The Bauhaus had a significant impact on art and architecture trends in Western Europe, Canada, the United States and Israel in the decades following its demise, as many of the artists involved fled, or were exiled by the Nazi regime. In 2004, Tel Aviv was named to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites due to its abundance of Bauhaus architecture. <sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"></sup>It had some 4,000 Bauhaus buildings erected from 1933 onwards.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer, and Moholy-Nagy reassembled in Britain during the mid-1930s to live and work in the Isokon project before the war caught up with them. Gropius and Breuer went to teach at the Harvard Graduate School of Design and worked together before their professional split. Their collaboration produced the Aluminum City Terrace in New Kensington, Pennsylvania, and the Alan I. W. Frank House in Pittsburgh, among other notable projects. The Harvard School was enormously influential in America in the late 1920s and early 1930s, producing notable students such as Philip Johnson, I. M. Pei, Lawrence Halprin, and Paul Rudolph, among many others.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The influence of the Bauhaus on design education was significant. One of the primary objectives of the Bauhaus was to unify art, craft, and technology, and this approach was integrated into the Bauhaus curriculum.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">One of the most important contributions of the Bauhaus is in the field of modern furniture design. The characteristic Cantilever chair and Wassily Chair, designed by Marcel Breuer, are two examples. The most profitable product of the Bauhaus was its wallpaper.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">In 1979, Bauhaus-Dessau College began organizing postgraduate programs that attracted participants from around the world. This effort has been supported by the Bauhaus-Dessau Foundation, which was founded in 1974 as a public institution.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Later evaluation of the Bauhaus design credo was critical of its flawed recognition of the human element, an acknowledgment of &#8220;the dated, unattractive aspects of the Bauhaus as a projection of utopia marked by mechanistic views of human nature…Home hygiene without home atmosphere.&#8221;</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"></sup>The <strong>White City</strong> refers to a collection of over 4,000 buildings built in the Bauhaus or International Style in Tel Aviv from the 1930s by German Jewish architects who immigrated to the British Mandate of Palestine after the rise of the Nazis. Tel Aviv has the most significant number of buildings in the Bauhaus/International Style of any city in the world. Preservation, documentation, and exhibitions have brought attention to Tel Aviv&#8217;s collection of 1930s architecture.

It was created in the late 18th century under the regency of Duke Leopold III of Anhalt-Dessau (1740-1817), who returned from a Ggrand tour of taly, the Netherlands, England, France, and Switzerland. Strongly influenced by the ideals of Tthe Enlightenment, they aimed to move beyond the formal garden concept of the Baroque era in favour of a naturalistic landscape, as een at Stourhead Gardens and Ermenonville.

It was laid out between 1769 and 1773 as one of the first English gardens on the continent. According to the ideals of Duke Leopold III, the park would also serve as an educational institution in architecture, gardening and agriculture; therefore, large parts were open to the public from the beginning. The gardens are protected from the floods of the Elbe River in the north by a dam that also serves as a belt walk, offering numerous views along the park&#8217;s sight lines.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Wörlitz Palace</strong>, completed in 1773, was the residence of Duke Leopold and his wife, Louise, and was the first Neoclassical building in present-day Germany.

At the eastern rim of the palace&#8217;s garden stands the Wörlitz Synagogue, built in 1790 as a rotunda modelled after the ancient &#8220;Temple of Vesta in Tivoli, Italy. The building that expressed Leopold&#8217;s religious tolerance was saved from demolition in the 1938 &#8220;Kristallnacht&#8221; pogrom by the custodian of the park, who subsequently lost his employment.
