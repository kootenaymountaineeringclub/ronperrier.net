Mor Yakup Church is situated just 100m to the east of Zeynel Abidin Mosque, and both lie about 250 meters from the Syrian border.</p><p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="irc_mi" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DjhEfkYXgAAAUic.jpg" alt="Image result for Zeynel Abidin Mosque Complex" width="620" height="349" /></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><br /> Mor Yakup Church.</strong> Mor Yakup was a prominent Assyrian saint born in Nisibis (now Nusaybin), and was brought up there. He was appointed the bishop of Nisibis in 309 and founded the Nisibis cathedral in 313. Nisibis was the major commercial and political centre in the East Roman Empire and the border of the Roman and Persian Empires. He and his student Mor Afrem (Saint Ephrem), a great ascetic, teacher and hymn writer, were present at the First Council of Nicaea (modern İznik province in Turkey) in 325. After they returned to Nusaybin, they built the Nisibis School where theology, philosophy, logic, literature, geometry, astronomy, medicine and law were subjects. The school contributed to the spread of Christianity in Mesopotamia via the students who were educated there.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The present church, one of the oldest religious structures of upper Mesopotamia dating to the 4th century was originally a Byzantine baptistery converted into a church. The most striking feature of the east side is wall decorations &#8211; a frieze on the door’s arches, apses and on the western arch.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The west side door arches also have excellent ornaments. A Greek inscription states “This baptistery was built with the contribution of priest Akepsyma in 571 (359/360), when Volagesus was metropolitan. Let them be remembered before God”. It is the first inscription mentioning the word “baptistery”.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The dome is dated to 1872. The crypt has a sarcophagus believed to belong to Mor Yakup.</p><p><noscript><img decoding="async" class="irc_mi" src="https://iadsb.tmgrup.com.tr/473a2f/610/343/0/0/1280/720?u=https://idsb.tmgrup.com.tr/2018/08/01/adjoinin-mosque-church-in-southeastern-turkey-likely-to-be-added-to-unesco-heritage-list-1533128552415.jpeg" alt="Image result for Zeynel Abidin Mosque Complex" width="620" height="348" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload irc_mi" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20620%20348%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://iadsb.tmgrup.com.tr/473a2f/610/343/0/0/1280/720?u=https://idsb.tmgrup.com.tr/2018/08/01/adjoinin-mosque-church-in-southeastern-turkey-likely-to-be-added-to-unesco-heritage-list-1533128552415.jpeg" alt="Image result for Zeynel Abidin Mosque Complex" width="620" height="348" /><noscript><img decoding="async" class="irc_mi" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c6/de/01/c6de0152d68a4c22e0a46dc6cb54a142.jpg" alt="Image result for Mor Yakup Church" width="619" height="445" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload irc_mi" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20619%20445%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c6/de/01/c6de0152d68a4c22e0a46dc6cb54a142.jpg" alt="Image result for Mor Yakup Church" width="619" height="445" /><noscript><img decoding="async" class="irc_mi" src="https://www.livius.org/site/assets/files/21628/nisibis_church_l_nave2.jpg" alt="Related image" width="615" height="409" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload irc_mi" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20615%20409%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://www.livius.org/site/assets/files/21628/nisibis_church_l_nave2.jpg" alt="Related image" width="615" height="409" /></p><p><strong>Zeynel Abidin Mosque Complex</strong>. Made of rough stone, this consists of a mosque, 1956 minaret, 1159 shrines of both Zeynel Abidin and his sister Sitti Zeynep (13<sup>th</sup> generation grandchild of the Prophet Muhammad), fountains, madrasah, graveyard and new apteshane. Construction dates to the 12<sup>th</sup> century. The mihrab and minbar are new. The building was renovated in later periods and lady&#8217;s worship was added to the community section.<br /> </span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><noscript><img decoding="async" class="irc_mi" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-doEvMC7lO5I/UARUXNnWlMI/AAAAAAAAZd4/o7bQiGx_uAc/s1600/Z.AB%C4%B0D%C4%B0N+CAM%C4%B0%C4%B02.jpg" alt="Image result for Zeynel Abidin Mosque Complex" width="459" height="664" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload irc_mi" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20459%20664%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-doEvMC7lO5I/UARUXNnWlMI/AAAAAAAAZd4/o7bQiGx_uAc/s1600/Z.AB%C4%B0D%C4%B0N+CAM%C4%B0%C4%B02.jpg" alt="Image result for Zeynel Abidin Mosque Complex" width="459" height="664" /></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /> Both have been significant centres of education and science. Nusaybin has been under Muslim control since the Arab conquest of 640. According to Syriac sources, the money required for the construction of Zeynel Abidin Mosque was given by two Christian priests with the idea of spending money on the way to God. The survival of the church for 1600 years is a testament to the Muslim respect for Mor Yakup. Both were built on land belonging to the same foundation with common cemeteries, shrines, madrasahs and schools.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>MIDYAT</strong></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Mor Gabriel Monastery</strong> (Saint Gabriel) is one of the oldest Christian monasteries in the world and is Syriac Orthodox. It was founded in 397 by two monks Mor Shmuel and his apprentice Mor Shemun on the Tur Abdin plateau near Midyat. According to legend, Shemun saw an Angel in a dream and this Angel told him to build a church in a place marked with three big stones.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The present monastery buildings were built at different times to meet the needs of the increasing number of monks with donations of the Roman and Byzantine Emperors like Honorius, Arcadius, Theodosius II and Anastasius. Now the monastery consists of two parts: the lower historic and the upper new annexes added in the last half-century.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The main Church was built in 512 but was under renovation when I was there.

It was fully renovated in 1991 with paintings of Christ on the walls done in 1992. The crypt (Beth Qadishe, &#8220;the House of Saints&#8221;) has over 12 000 relics of saints and martyrs.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">This monastery is surrounded by a one-kilometre, 6m high wall constructed from the red/white tuff.

It looks south to the Mesopotamian plains. The old city is connected by stairways and steep lanes radiating off the main cobbled street. The north side of the mountain is abandoned terraces.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">According to hearsay, the history of the city dates as far back as the Flood. The city lived under the rule of the Hurri-Mitani, Hittites, Surs, Babylonians, Persians, Arabs, and the Seljuk Turks. Later, the Mardin branch of the Artuklu Kingdom called &#8220;Tabaka Ilgaziyye&#8221; was established and the city flourished during this time.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The Mardin Cultural Landscape is a tentative WHS (25/02/2000). Cultural landscapes &#8212; cultivated terraces on lofty mountains, gardens, and sacred places &#8230; &#8212; testify to the creative genius, social development, and imaginative and spiritual vitality of humanity. They are part of our collective identity.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Houses in Mardin, reflecting all features of a closed-in lifestyle, are surrounded by 4-meter-high walls and isolated from the street. These walls also protect from harsh climatic conditions. Houses have separate sections for males and females and mostly have no kitchen. The most important feature of these houses is the stone craftsmanship called &#8220;Midyat Work&#8221;. Since in a volcanic area, the basic input used in local architecture is easily workable calcareous rock. Doors, windows, and small columns are dressed with arches and various motifs. Above the house doors are carved pictures of the Kaaba if the owner has made the pilgrimage to Mecca, and the door knockers have a distinctive form resembling the beaks of birds. Often the lanes run through arched tunnels beneath the upper floors of houses. Relief carvings of animals and fruit lend the city a dream-like character.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Syrian Orthodox gold and silver smiths whose work is famous throughout the country still practice their craft here, their workshops side by side with those of Muslim copper smiths. Along with the buildings themselves, it is to be hoped that this living culture can also be preserved.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Mardin is located in the area where the Southeastern Taurus Range meets the Arabian platform to the south. The area called &#8220;Mardin-Midyat Passage&#8221; constitutes a large part of the territory of the province. Mardin is on the rail and highway routes connecting Turkey to Syria and Iraq.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">After the completion of the GAP Project, 100,000 hectares of land were brought under irrigation in the Mardin area. Newly irrigated areas mainly grow cotton that is processed by enterprises in the Organized Industrial Zone. Besides flour products, fruit processing, and seed production, Mardin also processes its local grapes. Phosphate-containing fertilizers are provided by the fertilizer industries in the province.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Mardin Museum.</strong> The museum is housed in the former patriarchate constructed in 1895 by the Patriarch of Antakya, Ignatios Benham Banni. Now restored to its original condition, the building houses collections dating from 4000 BC up to the present day and representing the Assyrian, Urartian, Hellenistic, Persian, Roman, Byzantine, Seljuk, Artuklu, and Ottoman periods. Pottery, seals, cylinder seals, coins, lamps, figurines, teardrop bottles, and jewelry are among the many exhibits.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Mardin Bazaars.</strong> The single main street is one big shopping district.

One of the biggest of many monasteries in the region, Deyr&#8217;ul Zafaran has 52 Syriac Patriarchs buried here. The secret section for worshipping called &#8220;mahzen&#8221; is the oldest part of the monastery. The monastery was enlarged with additional sections built later. Around the structures which form a trinity with Deyr&#8217;ul Zafaran, the Church of Virgin Mary and Mar Yakup Monastery, there are three fortresses built to protect the trinity.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>DIYARBAKIR<br /> </strong>The walls and gates of the town together with the Ula Cami (Great Mosque) usually share the construction style of being built with black basalt stones decorated with white inlays.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Ten-Eyed Bridge</strong> (Dicle Bridge or Ongözlü Köprü).

Commagene was a kingdom founded north of Syria and the Euphrates after the breakup of Alexander&#8217;s empire. Nemrut Dağ is one of the most ambitious constructions of the Hellenistic period. The syncretism of its pantheon (the assimilation of Zeus with Oromasdes, the Iranian god Ahuramazda, and Heracles with Artagnes, the Iranian god Verathragna) and the lineage of its kings can be traced back through two sets of legends, Greek and Persian, both evidence of the dual origin of this kingdom&#8217;s culture.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Antiochos I is represented in this monument as a descendant of Darius by his father Mithridates, and a descendant of Alexander by his mother Laodice. This semi-legendary ancestry translates the ambition of a dynasty that sought to remain independent of the powers of both the East and the West. It has an intimate mixture of Greek, Persian and Anatolian aesthetics in the statuary and the bas-reliefs.</p><p><noscript><img decoding="async" class="irc_mi" src="https://i.sozcu.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/iecrop/n2-2_16_9_1522063863.jpg" alt="Image result for NEMRUT DAG" width="618" height="348" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload irc_mi" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20618%20348%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://i.sozcu.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/iecrop/n2-2_16_9_1522063863.jpg" alt="Image result for NEMRUT DAG" width="618" height="348" /></span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /> With a diameter of 145 m, the 50 m high funerary mound of stone chips is surrounded on three sides by terraces to the east, west and north.

Its complex design and colossal scale (some of the stone blocks used weigh up to nine tons) combined to create a project unequalled in the ancient world.

Furthermore, the Nemrut property is located within a first-degree earthquake zone very close to the East Anatolian Fault, which is seismically active.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">It has survived in a moderately well-preserved state.

It had four 8-segment columns on a great base and still with their capitals, each erected for Emperor Severus, his wife J. Domna, and their sons Caracalla and Geta. But Geta was killed and the column erected for him was removed by order of Emperor Caracalla (r. 211-217 AD). The road bed and several segments of the 1½m, eight-stepped sides with benches have been replaced.

Now seen as early evidence of prehistoric worship, the hilltop site, when first examined in the 1960s, was shunned by researchers as nothing more than a medieval cemetery, but is now thought to be the world&#8217;s oldest temple, the first human-built holy place.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Six miles from Urfa, this ancient city has some of the most startling archaeological discoveries of our time: massive carved stones about 11,000 years old, crafted and arranged by prehistoric people who had not yet developed metal tools or even pottery. The first megaliths found were very close to the surface and scarred by plows. As the archaeologists dug deeper, they unearthed pillars arranged in circles. And because those artifacts closely resemble others from nearby sites previously carbon-dated to about 9000 B.C., it is estimated that Gobekli Tepe&#8217;s stone structures are the same age.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The main excavation site consists of a rectangular pit with standing stones or pillars arranged in circles, one of them 65 feet across. Beyond, on the hillside, are four other rings of partially excavated pillars. Each ring has a roughly similar layout: in the center are two large stone T-shaped pillars encircled by slightly smaller stones facing inward. The tallest pillars tower 16 feet and weigh between seven and ten tons. Some are blank, while others are elaborately carved: foxes, lions, scorpions and vultures abound, twisting and crawling on the pillars&#8217; broadsides.</p><p><noscript><img decoding="async" class="irc_mi" src="https://iasbh.tmgrup.com.tr/151b86/752/395/0/65/725/445?u=https://isbh.tmgrup.com.tr/sbh/2018/08/16/gobeklitepe-hakkinda-bilmeniz-gereken-14-sey-1534420480874.jpg" alt="Image result for GÖBEKLI TEPE" width="619" height="325" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload irc_mi" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20619%20325%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://iasbh.tmgrup.com.tr/151b86/752/395/0/65/725/445?u=https://isbh.tmgrup.com.tr/sbh/2018/08/16/gobeklitepe-hakkinda-bilmeniz-gereken-14-sey-1534420480874.jpg" alt="Image result for GÖBEKLI TEPE" width="619" height="325" /><noscript><img decoding="async" class="irc_mi" src="https://arkeofili.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/gobek2.jpg" alt="Image result for GÖBEKLI TEPE" width="617" height="448" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload irc_mi" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20617%20448%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://arkeofili.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/gobek2.jpg" alt="Image result for GÖBEKLI TEPE" width="617" height="448" /></p><p>Gobekli Tepe sits at the northern edge of the Fertile Crescent—an arc of mild climate and arable land from the Persian Gulf to present-day Lebanon, Israel, Jordan and Egypt—and would have attracted hunter-gatherers from Africa and the Levant. From this perch 1,000 feet above the valley, the landscape 11,000 years ago, before centuries of intensive farming and settlement turned it into the nearly featureless brown expanse it is today, had herds of gazelle and other wild animals, gently flowing rivers, which attracted migrating geese and ducks; fruit and nut trees; and rippling fields of wild barley and wild wheat varieties such as emmer and einkorn &#8211; it was like a paradise.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">There is no evidence that people permanently resided on the summit of Gobekli Tepe &#8211; no cooking hearths, houses or trash pits, and none of the clay fertility figurines that litter nearby sites of about the same age. Tools including stone hammers and blades have been found and it is believed to be a place of worship on an unprecedented scale—humanity&#8217;s first &#8220;cathedral on a hill.&#8221;</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Using ground-penetrating radar and geomagnetic surveys, at least 16 other megalith rings remain buried across 22 acres. The one-acre excavation covers less than 5 percent of the site. Archaeologists could dig here for another 50 years and barely scratch the surface.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Unlike the stark plateaus nearby, Gobekli Tepe (the name means &#8220;belly hill&#8221; in Turkish) has a gently rounded top that rises 50 feet above the surrounding landscape and thought to be created by man, a gigantic Stone Age site.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Gobekli Tepe&#8217;s sloping, rocky ground was a stonecutter&#8217;s dream. Even without metal chisels or hammers, prehistoric masons wielding flint tools could have chipped away at softer limestone outcrops, shaping them into pillars on the spot before carrying them a few hundred yards to the summit and lifting them upright. Then, once the stone rings were finished, the ancient builders covered them over with dirt. Eventually, they placed another ring nearby or on top of the old one. Over centuries, these layers created the hilltop.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">More than 100,000 bone fragments including tens of thousands of gazelle bones (60 percent of the total), plus those of other wild game such as boar, sheep, red deer and a dozen different bird species, including vultures, cranes, ducks and geese obviously a hunter-gatherer site. The people who lived here had not yet domesticated animals or farmed. The surprising lack of evidence that people lived right there argues against its use as a settlement or even a place where, for instance, clan leaders gathered. Gobekli Tepe&#8217;s pillar carvings are dominated not by edible prey like deer and cattle but by menacing creatures such as lions, spiders, snakes and scorpions, a scary, fantastic world of nasty-looking beasts &#8211; perhaps these hunters were trying to master their fears by building this complex, which is a good distance from where they lived.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Gobekli Tepe&#8217;s builders were on the verge of a major change in how they lived, thanks to an environment that held the raw materials for farming. They had wild sheep, wild grains that could be domesticated—and the people with the potential to do it. Within 1,000 years of Gobekli Tepe&#8217;s construction, settlers had corralled sheep, cattle and pigs. At a prehistoric village just 20 miles away, geneticists found evidence of the world&#8217;s oldest domesticated strains of wheat; radiocarbon dating indicates agriculture developed there around 10,500 years ago, or just five centuries after Gobekli Tepe&#8217;s construction.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">These new findings suggest a novel theory of civilization. Scholars have long believed that only after people learned to farm and live in settled communities did they have the time, organization and resources to construct temples and support complicated social structures. Possibly it was the other way around: the extensive, coordinated effort to build the monoliths laid the groundwork for complex societies. The monuments could not have been built by ragged bands of hunter-gatherers. To carve, erect and bury rings of seven-ton stone pillars would have required hundreds of workers, all to be fed and housed. Hence the eventual emergence of settled communities in the area around 10,000 years ago. This shows sociocultural changes come first, and agriculture comes later, a good case this area is the real origin of complex Neolithic societies,</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">6,000 years before the invention of writing here, there&#8217;s more time between Gobekli Tepe and the Sumerian clay tablets [etched in 3300 B.C.] than from Sumer to today. Still, archaeologists have their theories—evidence, perhaps, of the irresistible human urge to explain the unexplainable.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The vulture carvings may have special significance. Some cultures have long believed the high-flying carrion birds transported the flesh of the dead up to the heavens. Possibly beneath the floors will be found the structures&#8217; true purpose: a final resting place for a society of hunters. Perhaps the site was a burial ground or the center of a death cult, the dead laid out on the hillside among the stylized gods and spirits of the afterlife. If so, Gobekli Tepe&#8217;s location was no accident. From here the dead are looking out at the ideal view looking out over a hunter&#8217;s dream.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Park at the bottom.

Sanliurfa was praised as the city of prophets Hiob, Jethro and St. George besides Abraham who was said to have lived here. This Holy city is full of historic religious, public, and civil architectural buildings. All are the best examples of tradition and art stone. The old city of Harran is situated in a land through which have run trade routes from Iskenderun to Antakya (ancient Antioch) and to Kargam~s. The city is mentioned in the Holy bible and in the documents found at Mari (a city in Northern Syria) It is important not only for hosting the early civilizations but it is the place where the first Islamic University is founded. The traditional civil architecture, mud brick houses with conic roofs, are unique.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Urfa bazaar.</strong> This is an unexceptional 3-level shopping centre with access from a plaza.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Sanliurfa Archaeology and Mosaic Museum. TL 14</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Urfa City Museum</strong>. Since the opening of the new archaeology museum, this is virtually deserted – a lot of documents, certificates, books, photographs, hand tools, musical instruments, traditional clothes, trades and handicrafts from Urfa. TL5</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Şanlıurfa Castle</strong> (Urfa Castle). Built in 814, it sits on a mountain in the centre of Sanliurfa. From below it has impressive ramparts and moats carved in stone but there is not much to see inside, just crumbling rock walls. Two high Roman pillars are accessible, but the castle itself has been closed for renovations for some time. It is a very historical place mentioned in the Bible, the palace of the Mandilion, the capital of the Crusaders. Great views of the city.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE OF ZEUGMA </strong>(Zeugma Antik Kenti) A tentative WHS (13/04/2012).</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Zeugma is 10 km away from Nizip and 50 km west of Gaziantep. Zeugma, literally “bridge” or “crossing” in ancient Greek, was located at the major ancient crossing on the river Euphrates. Zeugma was twin cities on the opposing banks of the river, but today the name Zeugma is usually understood to refer to the settlement on the west bank, called Seleucia after the founder, while the one on the East bank was called Apamea after his Persian wife Apama.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">They were Hellenistic settlements established by commander Seleucus Nicator around 300 BCE. The twin settlements were crucial in the cultural policies of the Seleucid Empire integrating Greco-Macedon and Semitic cultures in the region. In 64 CE, Seleucia came under the rule of the Commagene Kingdom, and then from 72 CE, it was the major eastern frontier city of the Roman Empire. With two Roman legions based in Zeugma in the first century CE, the strategic importance and cosmopolitan nature of the city increased greatly. Due to its crucial position on commercial routes and to the volume of its traffic, Zeugma was chosen by the Romans for toll collecting. Zeugma prospered and functioned as a major commercial city as well as a military base.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The preserved parts of the ancient city include the Hellenistic Agora, the Roman Agora, two sanctuaries, the stadium, the theatre, two bathhouses, the Roman legionary base, administrative structures of the Roman legion, the majority of the residential quarters, Hellenistic and Roman city walls, and the East, South and West necropolis (none of this is visible today – only the Roman houses below are visitable).</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Most of these remains date from the period between the first century BCE (the time of Antiochus, king of Commagene (64 BCE-72 CE) and the third century CE Roman period when the city was sacked by the Sassanian King Shapur in 253 CE. Commagene was a Roman client kingdom. Commagene is represented by two sanctuaries consecrated by Antiochus in the city showing the key role in Antiochus’ efforts to link the Greek and Persian cultures, under the kingdom’s key position between these two worlds, on the Euphrates. Belkıs Hill – the foremost sanctuary has three colossal cult statues and many others in pieces on the slopes of the hill. They are dexiosis stelai showing Antiochus in a hand-shaking position with the Gods. These statues most probably belong to the deities of the Commagenian pantheon. Both are in the Ganzintep Mosaic Museum.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Necropolis of Zeugma.</strong> Tombs and burials from the late 3<sup>rd</sup> century to the 3<sup>rd</sup> century AD range from Hellenistic rock-cut cist graves of the earliest Graeco-Macedonian settlers to the late Hellenistic and early Imperial tumuli (rock-cut rectangular slots, loculi-type graves, and rock-cut arched grave niches. The walls of the chambers were covered with frescoes and painted with flowers using bright colours such as red, green, and yellow. Most belonged to elite families in the city.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>The Roman Houses of Zeugma</strong> form the main covered exhibit. They are in the style of city villas with courtyards, covering around 600-800 square meters each. What makes the houses especially important is that after being demolished during the devastating Sasanian sack of the city in 253 CE, they were mostly uninhabited and kept intact providing invaluable information on daily life in a major Roman frontier city in the mid-third century. What remains are ruins of some walls and about 8 standing columns with mosaics displayed.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The architectural decoration of the houses mainly consists of exquisite mosaics and frescoes dating to the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE. Zeugma mosaics are a unique collection of pictorial art including unique pictorial renderings of Greek and Greco-Roman mythologies and popular novels, some with captions in Greek. Some also bear signatures of mosaicists as well as names of patrons who commissioned the implementation of the mosaics.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The <em>House of Dionysos</em> depicted the marriage of Dionysus and Ariadne, complete with servants bringing wedding presents and musicians. The <em>House of Danae</em> has a mosaic depicting the moment when Danae and Perseus were rescued by the fishermen Dictys on the shores of Seriphos Island after having drifted ashore in a nuptial chest. This house has some faded frescoes in one room. Most of the rest of the mosaics are some nice geometrics.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The <em>Houses of Poseidon and Euphrates</em> are lower and flooded by the dam on the Euphrates River built in 2000. Most of the mosaics and frescoes found in them were relocated to the Gaziantep Museum.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">This sits on the banks of the Euphrates Reservoir about 7 km north of the highway. Park at the grossly overbuilt Visitors Center and walk 400m to the exhibit. Free</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>GAZIANTEP </strong>(pop 1,675,000)</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Zeugma Mosaic Museum.</strong> With 66 mosaics, most from Zeugma, this is not to be missed. The Theonoe Mosaic at 71.57m2, is the largest and was rescued from the bottom of the reservoir (Birecik Dam) only when the water level dropped in 2002. Many are geometrics and Greek and Roman mythological scenes with an variety of geometric borders. A separate building houses several Byzantine 5<sup>th</sup> century mosaics including a huge one from a church. These are not as well done as the Zeugma mosaics.</p><p><noscript><img decoding="async" class="irc_mi" src="http://www.brodyaga.com/pages/photos/Turkey/Zeugma%20Mosaic%20Museum%20Turkey%201548138863(www.brodyaga.com).jpg" alt="Image result for Zeugma Mosaic Museum." width="622" height="350" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload irc_mi" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20622%20350%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="http://www.brodyaga.com/pages/photos/Turkey/Zeugma%20Mosaic%20Museum%20Turkey%201548138863(www.brodyaga.com).jpg" alt="Image result for Zeugma Mosaic Museum." width="622" height="350" /><noscript><img decoding="async" class="irc_mi" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/1049/1213838595_9110fd2dab_z.jpg" alt="Related image" width="472" height="476" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload irc_mi" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20472%20476%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://live.staticflickr.com/1049/1213838595_9110fd2dab_z.jpg" alt="Related image" width="472" height="476" /><noscript><img decoding="async" class="irc_mi" src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/zeugma-mosaic-museum-oceanus-tethys-gaziantep-turkey-83481879.jpg" alt="Image result for Zeugma Mosaic Museum." width="618" height="425" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload irc_mi" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20618%20425%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/zeugma-mosaic-museum-oceanus-tethys-gaziantep-turkey-83481879.jpg" alt="Image result for Zeugma Mosaic Museum." width="618" height="425" /><noscript><img decoding="async" class="irc_mi" src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/736/23819999316_da8096412b_b.jpg" alt="Image result for Zeugma Mosaic Museum." width="618" height="392" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload irc_mi" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20618%20392%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/736/23819999316_da8096412b_b.jpg" alt="Image result for Zeugma Mosaic Museum." width="618" height="392" /><br /> </span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">There are also sarcophagi, frescoes from Zeugma, and all the stelae from Zeugma. TL24</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Gaziantep Castle.</strong> Sitting on a hill in the middle of Ganziantep, it was built by the Hittites as an observation point and later built into the main Roman castle in the 2<sup>nd</sup>-3<sup>rd</sup> centuries. It was renovated to its present state by the Byzantines under Justinian in 527-565. It was the main site of defence of Gaziantep against French troops attempting to invade after the fall of the Ottoman Empire. The museum inside relates to the Turkish War of Independence.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Omeriye Mosque</strong>. Although the exact construction date is unknown, the first written record is from 1210, so was possibly built around 1150. Omereyn means “Two Omers”. It took its present shape in 1786 and was restored in 1850 and 2006. The main entrance door and mihrab are black and white stone and red marble. Inside, it is rough yellow stone, small with 3 arches and two black columns. Black, white and pink stones form the floor of the courtyard. The minaret has bullet marks from the War of Independence.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Coppersmith&#8217;s Bazaar</strong> (Bakirclar Carsisi). This atmospheric market has a little bit of everything but maybe the metalwork dominates. Several shops were pounding copper, most making decorative plates and plaques. The spice and coffee sections have great smells.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>UNDERGROUND WATER STRUCTURES in GAZIANTEP: Livas and Kastels</strong>. Tentative WHS:</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Dating to the 5<sup>th</sup> century, Gaziantep is located on the edge of the Alleben Stream and forms a C shape. The stream has low water levels further reduced by high summer temperatures with high evaporation. Geologically, lakes don’t form as most rainfall seeps underground. For all these reasons, the settlement has required water transport.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Livas</strong> are the underground water tunnels &#8211; well-calculated and gently sloping tunnels – excavated by human labour in the soft limestone, clayey limestone, and chalk formation that the city is situated on. Water is brought from the main source far from the city and distributed to the required places. New tunnels were added as the city grew creating a cobweb of livas continuing for miles.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The oldest livas line carrying water to the old city center is the Pancarlı Livas Line bringing water to the city from about 14 km northwest. The period of construction is uncertain. In the Ottoman era this line provided water for many monumental structures in the city, such as khans, madrasahs, baths, mosques, fountains and private houses by way of wells.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Kastels</strong> are the water structures that open the water coming from these tunnels for public use. Depending on the elevation of livas, kastels are located at varying depths. Instead of adding a system to bring up the water, they were built at the water level. Some are completely below ground while some are partly below ground. Kastels are comprehensively planned to serve the toilet, laundry, and clean water needs of the people. They perform different functions such as pools, wells, sitting places, small mosques, showers, toilets, and bathing places. They became an important meeting place in daily social life and were also used to cool off during hot summer days. They are both architecturally and culturally unique structures</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">A livas system provides clean water for every Kastel structure while the sewage is moved from the structures by another system. Livas have similar construction technology to underground water channels known as qanât seen in many parts of the world.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The right to use water and make a connection to the main livas was subject to permission. Every user on the line had to keep the water clean and was governed by social rules in the society creating a social interdependence and responsibility, based on water, which reflects social norms. The system of livas’ and water structures.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Digging of livas entails important engineering knowledge &#8211; the right slope at every point to provide a constant flow for hundreds of kilometres in the right direction. Maintenance and repair work had to be done. Those who work in the maintenance and repair of the livas’ are called &#8216;kanavatcı&#8217; in the local language.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Six kastels have survived of which I saw the first three.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Kastel of İhsan Bey (Esenbek).</strong> Dating to the 15th century, it is completely below- ground located under the courtyard of the mosque (remarkably similar to the Omeriye Mosque), both rock-carved places and with masonry walls. It includes a pool, places to sit a small mosque, and a museum. The entrance is next to the minaret but was not open.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The water for here comes from Dutluk even though they are all within a block or so of each other.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The only way to enter is via the museum. Follow the maze of corridors to find your way down through the caverns. There is running water into a shallow square pool surrounded by stone benches, a narrow shallow tunnel (that didn’t look like it should be entered, an elevated prayer bench, and more benches.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Kastel of Şeyh Fethullah.</strong> In the courtyard of Şeyh Fethullah Mosque with a hamam, madrasa, and zawiyah. Half of the kastel is above ground with two pools (only one with water but with a star design in the pool) and WC spaces.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Kastel of Pişirici (Beşinci).</strong> Constructed during the period of Mameluke, in1282-83, it is the oldest of the existing kastels in Gaziantep and it has the most developed plan scheme, with two connected spaces. Going down the stairs from ground level, the first space encountered houses pools, places to sit, WC and a bathing pool, while the second space functioned as a small mosque. It is open to the public.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">There is a lot of water flowing here through many channels in niches around the pools. The water here (and for Seyh, comes from Parcarli, 14kms to the northwest).</p><p><noscript><img decoding="async" class="irc_mi" src="https://www.kulturportali.gov.tr/repoKulturPortali/large/SehirRehberi//GezilecekYer/20170210154006478_pisirici_mescidi_ve_kasteli_003.jpg" alt="Image result for Kastel of Pişirici" width="622" height="414" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload irc_mi" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20622%20414%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://www.kulturportali.gov.tr/repoKulturPortali/large/SehirRehberi//GezilecekYer/20170210154006478_pisirici_mescidi_ve_kasteli_003.jpg" alt="Image result for Kastel of Pişirici" width="622" height="414" /><strong></p><p>Kastel of Kozluca.</strong> Located south of the Kozluca Mosque, half of the kastel is above ground with a traditional dwelling constructed over and serves as a museum today.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Kastel of Ahmet Çelebi.</strong> A simple kastel, it includes only a pool and a well and is now used as a part of Ahmet Çelebi Mosque.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Kastel of İmam Gazali.</strong> Completely below- ground it is a simple plan with rock-carved stairs to a rock-carved pool. This place is used for worship.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Water structures are important documents of human history because they describe the architectural, engineering, technological information, and social and cultural life of the society to which they belong. The Livas’ and kastel system is an exceptional example in terms of the transformation of the management of public water resources into a cultural tradition.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Unconscious interventions in the city center resulting from the construction activities after the 1950s have led to livas’ being interrupted in places. It is required to document the livas before any kind of construction intervention is made in the urban conservation area. It is planned to completely remove the basement floor permit for construction activities.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Livas’ and kastels used for at least 800 years were used by the Gaziantep people until the 1950s. The livas’ between the Pişirici, Kozluca, İhsan Bey, and Fethullah Kastels have been cleaned by the municipality to restore their original function.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Whether called &#8216;qanât&#8217; or &#8216;karez&#8217;, this system has developed from the first millennium B.C. to today and can be seen in an area from China to Iran, Yemen, and even Mexico.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Water management through qanât systems played a crucial role in the development of the Silk Road. &#8211; the Persian Qanat in Iran, Bam, Karez in Pakistan, and Karez Wells in China are all on the Tentative List.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Other underground water tunnels are mainly aimed at irrigating agricultural land, while they contribute to urban use in some places. The livas’ of Gaziantep, unlike these structures, were excavated mainly to bring clean water to the people of the city and not for agricultural irrigation. The kastel structures in Gaziantep are dated mostly to the Ottoman period, while the livas’ are estimated to be earlier.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Gaziantep Planetarium and Science Center.</strong> This is an attractive building with a slanted glass roof with a gold round globe in the middle of the roof.

The Workshop covers an approximate area of 400&#215;20 meters beginning from the watercourse of Yesemek Brook rising upwards about 90 meters.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Composed of high-quality and thin porous volcanic dolerite/basalt rocks, the area was used as a quarry and a workshop dating to 900-800 B.C. as a center of mass production of sculptures manufactured for the capital of the Samal Kingdom. Following the collapse of the Kingdom against the Assyrians during the 8th century B.C., the quarry and workshop were closed and the workers left the region. The surface was covered with soil and was frozen in the 8<sup>th</sup> century B.C.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">It was the biggest open-air sculpture workshop of Antique Front Asia, providing information about the process from a stone block to a sculpture. More than 300 hundred sculptures and orthostats from the Late Hittite Kingdom show the development of art and technology in sculpture production. First, the size of the block that would be cut from the quarry was determined and deep grooves were opened around it to put trees inside. The required part was cut from the rock by breaking the rock through the pressure caused by the expansion of trees after watering. These rough rectangular prism-shaped blocks weighing 500kg up to 15 tons were then sculptured on the hill by the sculpture craftsmen to a certain level and then transferred to neighbouring cities to complete the details of the sculpture according to the demands of the people who ordered them. Hundreds of lions and sphinx figures, many god reliefs and more than 300 sculptures and orthostats with reliefs in different manufacturing stages are undamaged. The sculptures at Yesemek are not only artworks but also represent the religious beliefs of their age.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Certain sculpture workshops similar to the one at Yesemek can be observed over different periods throughout the Ancient Near East: Boğazköy and Kalınkaya (near Alaca Höyük) in Anatolia, Domuztepe and Carchemish in Southeastern Anatolia, Sikizlar (Sekizler) in Syria, Minet el Beida and Tiripoli in Syria and Aswan in Egypt. The sculptures produced in these workshops are generally of a higher artistic standard than the sculpture blocks in Yesemek.</p><p><noscript><img decoding="async" class="irc_mi" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DSMTheeUIAArEdf.jpg" alt="Image result for YESEMEK QUARRY" width="618" height="414" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload irc_mi" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20618%20414%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DSMTheeUIAArEdf.jpg" alt="Image result for YESEMEK QUARRY" width="618" height="414" /></span></p><div class="printfriendly pf-button pf-button-content pf-alignleft"> <a href="index.html#" rel="nofollow" onclick="window.print(); return false;" title="Printer Friendly, PDF & Email"> <noscript><img decoding="async" class="pf-button-img" src="https://cdn.printfriendly.com/buttons/printfriendly-pdf-email-button-md.png" alt="Print Friendly, PDF & Email" style="width: 194px;height: 30px;"  /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload pf-button-img" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://cdn.printfriendly.com/buttons/printfriendly-pdf-email-button-md.png" alt="Print Friendly, PDF & Email" style="width: 194px;height: 30px;"  /> </a></div></div></div><div id="entry-author-info"><div id="author-avatar"></div><div id="author-description"><h2> About admin</h2> I would like to think of myself as a full time traveler.
