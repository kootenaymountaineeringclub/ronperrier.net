They gave access to the narrow Caspian Plain, the most important trade route connecting Azerbaijan and Middle Asia with Southwest Europe. A united defensive system of 300 constructions, town stronghold palaces and towers was built with military, strategic, trade and economic importance from Derbent city to the Apsheron peninsula. The Apsheron peninsula controlled by the Shirvanshah was invaded by Russians, Cossacks, Turkmens, and even Italian brigands.<br /> <strong>Beshbarmag Barrier.</strong> Between Behsbarmag Mountain at the southeast end of the Caucasus and the Caspian shore is the narrowest passage of 11.75 km. A raw brick wall ending with two parallel walls 200 meters apart closed the passage. It was built by Shah Sasanid Yezdegird II (438-457). A separate stone stronghold and caravanserai were also built.<br /> <strong>Gil-gilchay Barrier</strong>. North of the Beshbarmag Barrier, this was built by Shah Gubad of the Sasanid dynasty (488-531). It closed the Caspian Shore passage and the Gilgilchay pond with a raw brick wall and stone “long walls&#8221; with towers, guardhouses and town strongholds. The best preserved is Chiraggala stronghold in Chirag Village, Devenchy.<br /> <strong>Shabran Barrier.</strong> In Shabran town, all international caravan ways joined. Shabran was the biggest province in Azerbaijan, producing raw silk, gas, salt and saffron were important trade items.<br /> <strong>Baku City.</strong> In the XIV century, Shirvanshahs began to fortify Baku and its area, the biggest and the most acceptable harbour on the Caspian. It became the second-strongest defensive town after Derbend. <strong>Maiden Tower</strong> (5-12<sup>th</sup> century) and <strong>Bayil (Sabayil) Palace</strong> (12<sup>th</sup>–14<sup>th</sup> century) protected Baku from the sea. The palace was the gate for the international sea trade and the residence of the Shirvanshahs but the strong 1306 earthquake combined with the rise of the water level in the Caspian Sea destroyed the palace.<br /> There were 30 other strongholds in all the big villages on the north sea coast of the Apsheron peninsula as the main dangers were from the sea. The stronghold towers rapidly transmitted warning signals &#8211; fire at night and the smoke in the day &#8211; from the northern Caspian Shore to other towers on the peninsula.<br /> <strong>Mardakan stronghold. </strong>The oldest of them, it was built in 1187-1188 by Akhista II Shirvanshah Shah. The Small Mardakan stronghold was built nearby by Gershasb in 1204 on the shore of Shagan village with ruins still visible.<br /> <strong>Nardaran stronghold</strong> was built in 1301.<br /> <strong>Romana Palace</strong> (XIV) was one of the other Absheron monumental constructions.</p><p><strong>ABSHERON PENINSULA<br /> </strong>The Absheron Peninsula (consists of Sumqayit, Baku and the Absheron Rayon) was considered by scientists to be the most ecologically devastated part of Azerbaijan. As a result of the Soviet planning in the industrial boom era, the city became heavily polluted. Soon after Azerbaijan&#8217;s independence, the industrial sectors declined.<strong><br /> Sumqayit.</strong> (pop 343,000)<br /> The second-largest city in Azerbaijan, it lies on the Caspian Sea, about 31 km north of Baku. The city was founded in 1949.<br /> In 1935, the Soviet government developed heavy industry in the Absheron Peninsula, and the future location of Sumgayit was chosen based on its proximity to Baku and its key position on existing railroad lines. Between 1938-41, a thermal power station was constructed to power Baku&#8217;s growing petroleum industry. This was soon followed by more heavy industries including metallurgical and chemical plants after the war. In the 1950s: the Synthetic Rubber Production Plant produced ethylene obtained from oil, Sumgayit Steel Processing Plant, Sumgayit Aluminium, and Petroleum Chemical Factory, the largest in Europe at the time. From 1961 through 1968: a brick-producing factory, a polymer construction materials industrial complex and a phosphor production plant. In 1970–&#8217;80s, light industry and mechanical engineering facilities were added to the industrial base of the city. By the end of the 1980s, Sumgayit was already the center of the chemical industry of the USSR.<br /> Sumgayit was subsequently named the most polluted place on Earth by U.S.-based environmental groups due to the former Soviet industrial base polluting the local environment with industrial chemicals like chlorine and heavy metals. Cancer rates in Sumgayit were as much as 51% higher than the national average and genetic mutations and birth defects were commonplace. The city was known for its children&#8217;s cemetery, known as the &#8220;Baby Cemetery&#8221; which contains many graves of infants born with deformities and mental retardation that were further complicated by the lack of adequate medical care for the poor. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Sumgayit has remained Azerbaijan&#8217;s second-biggest industrial center after Baku.<br /> An environmental protection plan introduced in 2003 has been steadily decreasing the levels of pollution to a minimum. The amount of wastewater from industrial production decreased from 600,000 m3 during the 1990s to 76,300 m3 in 2005. Solid waste went down from 300,000 to 3,868 tons a year. A burial range for mercury waste was constructed.<br /> After the Nagorno-Karabakh War, the city became home to some Azerbaijani refugees and internally displaced persons, mainly from Qubadli nad Zengilan regions.</p><p><strong>BAKU </strong>(pop 2 million 2009)<br /> Baku is the capital and largest city of Azerbaijan, as well as the largest city on the Caspian Sea and of the Caucasus region. Baku is located 28 metres (92 ft) below sea level, which makes it the lowest-lying national capital in the world and also the largest city in the world located below sea level. Baku lies on the southern shore of the Absheron Peninsula, alongside the Bay of Baku. Officially, about 25% of all inhabitants of the country live in Baku&#8217;s metropolitan area. Baku is the sole metropolis in Azerbaijan.<br /> Baku is divided into twelve administrative regions and 48 townships. Among these are the townships on the islands of the Baku Archipelago, and the town of Oil Rocks built on stilts in the Caspian Sea, 60 kilometres (37 miles) away from Baku. The Inner City of Baku, the Shirvanshah&#8217;s Palace and Maiden Tower, were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000.<br /> The city is the scientific, cultural, and industrial center of Azerbaijan. Many sizeable Azerbaijani institutions have their headquarters there. The Baku International Sea Trade Port is capable of handling two million tons of general and dry bulk cargo per year. In recent years, Baku has become an important venue for international events. It hosted the 57th Eurovision Song Contest in 2012, the 2015 European Games, the 4th Islamic Solidarity Games, the F1 Azerbaijan Grand Prix in 2016, hosted the final of the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League and, will be one of the host cities for UEFA Euro 2020.<br /> The city is renowned for its harsh winds, which is reflected in its nickname, the &#8220;City of Winds&#8221;.<br /> The northern suburbs of Baku are particularly unattractive – barren oil fields with many derricks and pumps, natural gas lines above ground forming networks of metal piping, few or no street lights, poor housing, and mud lanes. There are several large lakes.<br /> <u><br /> </u><strong>Day 1</strong><u> in Baku<br /> </u><strong>“Binagadi&#8221; 4th Period Fauna and Flora Deposit </strong>(30/09/1998). This is located in northern Baku in Binagadi District under a lake at 40° 15&#8242; 50~ north and 49° 45&#8242; 55&#8243; east. This ancient flora and fauna deposit of the Pliocene era has rich vegetation, animals and insect remains covered by a thick layer of petroleum at the bottom of an ancient shrivelled lake. 40 mammals, 120 birds, 2 reptiles and one amphibian, as well as 107 species of insects and 22 species of vegetation relics, have been discovered. It is richer than the 4th Period fauna deposit in Californian Rancho-Lle-Brlant Pitch.<br /> <strong>&#8220;Lok-Batan&#8221; Mud Cone</strong> (30/09/1998). This is a mud volcano located in Binagadi. The mud volcano erupted in 1977 and again, on October 10, 2001, when it produced large flames many tens of meters high. It is now a cone of dirt.<br /> <strong>Yanar Dag.</strong> An NM “sight”, is a natural gas fire that blazes continuously on a hillside NE of Baku (Azerbaijan is known as &#8220;the Land of Fire&#8221;). Flames jet into the air 3 metres (9.8 ft) from a thin, porous sandstone layer. Unlike mud volcanoes, the Yanar Dag flame burns fairly steadily, as it involves a steady seep of gas from the subsurface. It is claimed that the Yanar Dag flame was only noted when accidentally lit by a shepherd in the 1950s. There is no seepage of mud or liquid, which distinguishes it from the nearby mud volcanoes of Lökbatan or Gobustan.<br /> On the territory of Yanar Dag, the State Historical-Cultural and Natural Reserve was established with the Yanardag Museum and Yanardag Cromlech Stone Exhibition.<br /> <strong>Ramana Tower</strong> (Ramana Qalasi). Ramana tower is one of more than 30 strongholds on the north seashore in the Absheron peninsula as the main danger came from the sea, and the stronghold towers received the warning signals (fire at night and smoke in the afternoon) from the northern Caspian Shore defensive barriers to pass them along to other towers on the peninsula.<br /> Located on the tallest rock in Ramana village of Baku, it is seen from all surrounding villages. The exact date of construction is not known but is probably from the 12<sup>th</sup> to the 14<sup>th</sup> century. It was used as a castle during the reign of Shirvanshahs&#8217;.<br /> It is a small square castle with 10m high crenellated walls and a large central square keep or donjon that is 15m high. There are towers in the middle of the walls.</p><p><strong>SOCAR Tower</strong>. Headquarters of SOCAR (State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic), it was built between 2010-2016. Located on the highway from the main airport to downtown Baku, it is visible on the way to the city center and is one of the landmarks of the city.<br /> The building was designed by Heerim Architects from South Korea based on the concept of &#8220;wind and fire&#8221; with two towers that curve around each other as they rise. It is 209 m (686 ft) tall with 42 floors mainly office space, but also conference and sports facilities, a guest house, retail spaces and food outlets.<br /> The building&#8217;s design is based on a composite system of steel construction with reinforced concrete walls. The building is designed to be resistant to wind speeds of 190 km/h and a magnitude nine earthquake.</p><p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="irc_mi" src="http://images.skyscrapercenter.com/building/socar-tower_heerim-architects-planners3.jpg" alt="Image result for SOCAR Tower" width="461" height="692" /></p><p><strong>Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center.</strong> This is an architectural masterpiece noted for its flowing, curved style and lack of sharp angles. The center is named after Heydar Aliyev, the first secretary of Soviet Azerbaijan from 1969-82, and president of the Azerbaijan Republic from 1993-2003.<br /> All functions of the Center, together with entrances, are represented by folds in a single continuous surface. This fluid form connects the various cultural spaces and provides each element with its own identity and privacy. As it folds inside, the skin gives way to become an element of the interior landscape of the Center. Extending on eight-floor levels, the center accommodates a 1000-seat auditorium, temporary exhibition spaces, a conference center, workshops, and a museum. It holds major exhibitions such as The Historic Masterpieces Exhibition, which included ancient artifacts from Georgia and Azerbaijan from the Gajar epoch with ceramic and metal works, canvases, miniatures and belongings of Fatali Khan.<br /> The Mini Azerbaijan exhibition on the second floor features the history and architecture of buildings in Azerbaijan.</p><p><strong>Baku Karting.</strong> This an event center, the large, covered entertainment-karting center to be able to drive a racing car while being in complete safety. Experienced riders will open the secrets of racing and help to achieve outstanding results.<br /> <strong>Heydar Mosque.</strong> This is a magnificent modern yellow stone mosque with a high wall, a street on one side, and a large plaza of white stone with two pools and an open book of the details on the other side. Opened in 2012, the 4 minarets are 95m high, the dome is 55 m high and 30m in circumference. The façade is carved with Islamic figures. Inside it is plain white and all carved with no paintings.

I have been retired since 2006 and in that time have traveled every winter for four to seven months. The months that I am "home", are often also spent on the road, hiking or kayaking. 
I hope to present a website that describes my travel along with my hiking and sea kayaking experiences.<div id="author-link"> <a href="../../../../author/admin/index.html" rel="author"> View all posts by admin <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span> </a></div></div></div><div class="entry-utility"> This entry was posted in <a href="../../../../category/uncategorized/index.html" rel="category tag">Uncategorized</a>.
