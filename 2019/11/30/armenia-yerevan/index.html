It has been the capital since 1918, the fourteenth in the history of Armenia and the seventh located in or around the Ararat plain.<br /> The history of Yerevan dates back to the 8th century BC, with the founding of the fortress of Erebuni in 782 BC by King Argishti I at the western extreme of the Ararat plain. Erebuni was &#8220;designed as a great administrative and religious centre, a fully royal capital.&#8221; By the late ancient Armenian Kingdom, new capital cities were established and Yerevan declined in importance. After World War I, Yerevan became the capital of the First Republic of Armenia as thousands of survivors of the Armenian Genocide in the Ottoman Empire arrived in the area. The city expanded rapidly during the 20th century as Armenia became part of the Soviet Union. In a few decades, Yerevan was transformed from a provincial town within the Russian Empire to Armenia&#8217;s principal cultural, artistic, and industrial centre, as well as becoming the seat of the national government.</p><p><strong>Levon&#8217;s Divine Underground</strong> (Wonder museum in the village of Arninj). About 6kms east of Yerevan in the village of Arninj, don’t miss this “underground city” carved using only a hammer and chisel dover 23 years by one man, Levon Arakelyan, under his house. It all began when he started to dig a pit for potatoes in his cellar in 1985 at the age of 44. Encountering rock, he built stairs to what was supposed to be a wine cellar and then simply continued with many corridors, more stairs (a total of 80 steps), 7 rooms of different sizes, religious altars, designs in the walls, niches for lights and arches – going 21m deep and all superbly carved with lovely high arched tunnels. 400-500 trucks of material were eventually removed. His love affair only stopped on his sudden death from a heart attack in 2009.<br /> Enter his modest house to meet his wife and daughter who gives you a tour. After, in the small living room, see displays of his clothes, hard hats, boots, worn-out chisels and hammers and get an opportunity to buy baked goods and honey. The lovely garden has a wall of painted rocks and mosaic pictures of him and his wife. 2000 AMD</p><p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="irc_mi" src="https://www.thephuketnews.com/photo/listing/2018/1533289521_1.jpg" alt="Related image" width="620" height="311" /><noscript><img decoding="async" class="irc_mi" src="https://i2.wp.com/unusualplaces.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Levoncave6.jpg" alt="Image result for Levon's Divine Underground" width="620" height="494" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload irc_mi" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20620%20494%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://i2.wp.com/unusualplaces.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Levoncave6.jpg" alt="Image result for Levon's Divine Underground" width="620" height="494" /><noscript><img decoding="async" class="irc_mi" src="https://www.egypttoday.com/siteimages/Larg/50645.jpg" alt="Related image" width="618" height="372" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload irc_mi" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20618%20372%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://www.egypttoday.com/siteimages/Larg/50645.jpg" alt="Related image" width="618" height="372" /></p><p><strong><em>YEREVAN CARD. </em></strong>Offers free admission to 40 museums, 6 tours, and public transportation (including airport transfers) and discounts on shopping, night life, art galleries and some adventure activities. 24-hours – 14,000 AMD; 48-hours – 18,000 AMD; 72-hours – 21,000 AMD.

Comes with a map<strong><em><br /> </em></strong><strong>Yerevan Botanical Garden.</strong> Basically put to sleep for the winter, walk up an avenue with round flowerbeds and the rose garden, refurbished by the Government of Switzerland. A once nice, large, round greenhouse is now derelict. Most of the gardens would be mature trees and bush in season. Operated by the National Academy of Sciences. 300 AMD<br /> <strong>Folk Art Museum.</strong> Wonderful displays of wood carving, metal work, embroidery, lace and rugs, most produced in Armenian villages. 1000 AMD<br /> <strong>Mother Armenia.</strong> This is a female personification of Armenia. Her most public visual rendering is a monumental hammered copper statue in Victory Park overlooking the capital city.<br /> The current statue replaces a monumental statue of General Secretary Joseph Stalin that was created as a victory memorial for World War II and unveiled in 1950. The basalt pedestal is designed to resemble a three-nave basilica Armenian church. In the spring 1962, the statue of Stalin was removed, with one soldier being killed and many injured during the process, and replaced by the Mother Armenia statue. &#8220;Mother Armenia&#8221; has a height of 22 metres (72 ft), with an overall height of 51 metres (167 ft).<br /> The Mother Armenia statue symbolises peace through strength reminding you of some of the prominent female figures in Armenian history, such as Sose Mayrig and others, who took up arms to help their husbands in their clashes with Turkish troops and Kurdish irregulars. It also recalls the important status and value attributed to the older female members of an Armenian family. Its location on a hill overlooking Yerevan makes it look like a guardian of the Armenian capital.<br /> Every year on 9 May, thousands of Armenians visit the statue of Mother Armenia and lay flowers to commemorate the Armenian martyrs of the Second World War. The pedestal hosts the Mother Armenia Military Museum of the Ministry of Defense, a large proportion of the exhibition space is devoted to the Nagorno-Karabakh War of 1988–1994.</p><p><noscript><img decoding="async" class="irc_mi" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f3/9a/70/f39a70cf04d8da72200280c62957887e.jpg" alt="Image result for mother armenia statue" width="463" height="617" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload irc_mi" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20463%20617%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f3/9a/70/f39a70cf04d8da72200280c62957887e.jpg" alt="Image result for mother armenia statue" width="463" height="617" /><br /> <strong><br /> Matendaran &#8211; Museum of Ancient Manuscripts.</strong> This is a museum, a repository of manuscripts, and a research institute, the world&#8217;s largest repository of Armenian manuscripts. It was established in 1959 based on the nationalized collection of the Armenian Church, formerly held at Etchmiadzin. Its collection has gradually risen since its establishment, mostly from individual donations. One of the most prominent landmarks of Yerevan, it is named after Mesrop Mashtots, the inventor of the Armenian alphabet, whose statue stands in front of the building.<br /> This is not very interesting to foreign tourists, but the building is nice. 250 AMD<br /> <strong>The Armenian National Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet</strong>.

But the descriptions are too wordy.

Charents&#8217; literary subject matter ranged from his experiences in the First World War, socialist revolution, and frequently Armenia and Armenians.<sup id="cite_ref-SAE_1-0" class="reference"></sup> He is recognized as &#8220;the main poet of the 20th century&#8221; in Armenia.<br /> <sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"></sup>An early supporter of communism, Charents joined the Bolshevik party, but as the Stalinist terror began in the 1930s, he gradually grew disillusioned with Stalinism and excepting a few poems in journals, Charents could publish nothing after 1934. In 1936, when Soviet Armenian leader Aghasi Khanjian was killed, Charents wrote a series of seven sonnets. After Komitas&#8217;s death, he wrote one of his last great works, &#8220;Requiem Æternam in Memory of Komitas&#8221; (1936).<br /> He became a morphine addict under the pressure of the campaign against him. A victim of Yezhov&#8217;s purges, he was charged with &#8220;counterrevolutionary and nationalist activity&#8221; and imprisoned<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"></sup> during the 1937 Great Purge. He died in the prison hospital. It is unknown where his body was buried.

He is considered one of the leading Soviet composers.<br /> Born and raised in Tbilisi, Georgia, he moved to Moscow in 1921. His first major work, the Piano Concerto (1936), popularized his name within and outside the Soviet Union. It was followed by the Violin Concerto (1940) and the Cello Concerto (1946). His other significant compositions include the <i>Masquerade Suite</i> (1941), the Anthem of the Armenian SSR (1944), three symphonies (1935, 1943, 1947), and around 25 film scores. Khachaturian is best known for his ballet music—<i>Gayane</i> (1942) and <i>Spartacus</i> (1954). His most popular piece, the &#8220;Sabre Dance&#8221; from <i>Gayane</i>, has been used extensively in popular culture and has been covered by many musicians worldwide. His style is &#8220;characterized by colourful harmonies, captivating rhythms, virtuosity, improvisations, and sensuous melodies&#8221;.<br /> During most of his career, Khachaturian was approved by the Soviet government and held several high posts in the Union of Soviet Composers from the late 1930s. Considered the most renowned Armenian composer of the 20th century. While following the established musical traditions of Russia, he broadly used Armenian and, to a lesser extent, Caucasian, Eastern Central European, and Middle Eastern peoples&#8217; folk music in his works. He is highly regarded in Armenia, where he is considered a &#8220;national treasure&#8221;.<br /> The museum is a monumental stone structure fronted by 5 enormous white limestone pillars. 1000 AMD<br /> <strong>Dvin Hotel.</strong> In the NM &#8220;Modern Architecture, Buildings&#8221; series, this is three low stories of mirrored glass backed by an 8-story tower with round-arched windows.

This, combined with his controversial lifestyle and behaviour, led Soviet authorities to repeatedly persecute and imprison him, and suppress his films.<br /> Although he started professional film-making in 1954, Parajanov later disowned all the films he made before 1965 as &#8220;garbage&#8221;. After directing <i>Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors</i> (renamed <i>Wild Horses of Fire</i> for most foreign distributions) Parajanov became something of an international celebrity and simultaneously a target of attacks from the system. Nearly all of his film projects and plans from 1965 to 1973 were banned, scrapped or closed by the Soviet film administrations, both local (in Kyiv and Yerevan) and federal (Goskino), almost without discussion, until he was finally arrested in late 1973 on charges of rape, homosexuality and bribery. He was imprisoned until 1977, despite pleas for pardon from various artists. Even after his release (he was arrested for the third and last time in 1982) he was a <i>persona non grata</i> in Soviet cinema. It was not until the mid-1980s, when the political climate started to relax, that he could resume directing.<br /> His health was seriously weakened by four years in labour camps and nine months in prison in Tbilisi, Parajanov died of lung cancer in 1990, at a time when, after almost 20 years of suppression, his films were being featured at foreign film festivals. Sergei Parajanov is buried at Komitas Pantheon in Yerevan.<br /> The museum is a gorgeous stone house specially built for him but he died before it was finished and never lived in it, although it has his furniture. Don&#8217;t miss it as it is full of his wonderful art produced when he was exiled from making films &#8211; most unusual collages of broken and found objects. 1000 AMD</p><p><noscript><img decoding="async" class="irc_mi" src="https://dimg04.c-ctrip.com/images/100p070000002oj659CB4_C_750_350.jpg?proc=source%2Ftrip" alt="Image result for Sergei Parajanov Museum" width="619" height="289" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload irc_mi" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20619%20289%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://dimg04.c-ctrip.com/images/100p070000002oj659CB4_C_750_350.jpg?proc=source%2Ftrip" alt="Image result for Sergei Parajanov Museum" width="619" height="289" /><noscript><img decoding="async" class="irc_mi" src="https://parajanov.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/parajanov_the_last_supper1.jpg" alt="Image result for Sergei Parajanov Museum" width="619" height="463" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload irc_mi" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20619%20463%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://parajanov.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/parajanov_the_last_supper1.jpg" alt="Image result for Sergei Parajanov Museum" width="619" height="463" /><noscript><img decoding="async" class="irc_mi" src="http://admin.agos.com.tr/Upload/Agos/Images/parajanov%20caydanlik.jpg" alt="Image result for Sergei Parajanov Museum" width="617" height="462" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload irc_mi" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20617%20462%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="http://admin.agos.com.tr/Upload/Agos/Images/parajanov%20caydanlik.jpg" alt="Image result for Sergei Parajanov Museum" width="617" height="462" /></p><p><strong>Modern Art Museum.</strong> In a surprisingly nice gallery on the bottom of a decrepit Soviet-style apartment building, I liked some of the paintings and sculptures. 500 AMD<br /> <strong>Central (Blue) Mosque.</strong> Dating from 1765, it has lovely tile work on the entrance, a large hall and the 22m dome and front of the mosque.

Behind them, a grand palace, a colonnaded royal assembly hall, a temple dedicated to Khaldi, a citadel were central and inner walls richly decorated with murals and other wall paintings, displaying religious and secular scenes.<br /> Successive Urartian kings made Erebuni their place of residence during their military campaigns against northern invaders and continued construction work to build up the fortress defences. Kings Sarduri II and Rusa I also utilized Erebuni as a staging site for new campaigns of conquest directed toward the north.

The city was built between 189-188 BC and remained the main capital of Greater Armenia for 600 years. The Romans destroyed it in 59 AD, retaken by the Armenians in 63 by T’rdat I (r. 63-88), the founder of the Arshakuni dynasty. He reconstructed Artashat in 66. Rome destroyed it again in 163.<br /> King Khosrov III moved the capital to Dvin in 335. The Persians destroyed Artashat’s fortress walls in 368, it was rebuilt and survived until the fall of the Arshakuni dynasty in 428.<br /> <strong>Khor Virap Monastery</strong>, Lusarat. Venerated since the time of Gregory the Illuminator’s death in 334 and a pilgrimage site in the 5<sup>th</sup>-6<sup>th</sup> centuries. The present monastery dates to the 7<sup>th</sup> century and sits on hill 6 of the ancient city of Artashat.<br /> <em>St Astvatsatsin Church.</em> The main church in the center of the fortress walls was destroyed by the Timurids in the 14<sup>th</sup> century and rebuilt in the 17<sup>th</sup> century. It was damaged in the earthquakes in 1939, 1949, and 1957 and renovated in 2000-01. The outside has an eight-faceted conical drum. At the front entrance is a 17th-century bell tower supported by 8 columns. It is a working church.<br /> <em>St Gevorg Church</em> (Khor Virap). The story begins in the 3<sup>rd</sup> century when the Armenian King Khosrov the Great was murdered by Anak who was recruited by the Persian Sassanids. Anak was executed but one of his sons (Gregory the Illuminator) escaped.<br /> Khosrov had two sons. T’rdat was taken to Rome, raised under royal patronage and became the head of a Roman legion to attack the Sassanids in Armenia. After driving them out of I287, he put Grigor into Khor Virap, a deep pit in the castle dungeon at Artashat, filled with poisonous snakes and insects. There he languished for 13 years. The present king met Grigor at Zvartnots, repented his sins, converted to Christianity, and was cured of his madness, thus beginning the conversion of the kingdom of Armenia to Christianity beginning in 301.<br /> It is sitting in the SW corner of the walls with a renovated building on top and can&#8217;t be entered.</p><p><strong>The Archaeological Site of the city of Dvin</strong> (25/08/1995). Dvin was a large commercial city and the capital of early medieval Armenia. It was situated north of the previous ancient capital of Armenia, the city of Artaxata, along the banks of the Metsamor River, 35 km to the south of modern Yerevan. The site of the ancient city is currently not much more than a large hill.<br /> The ancient city of Dvin was built by Khosrov III Kotak in 335 and since the city had been used as the primary residence of the Armenian Kings of the Arsacid dynasty. Dvin boasted a population of about 100,000 citizens, one of the most populous and wealthiest cities east of Constantinople.<br /> After the fall of the Armenian Kingdom in 428, Dvin was controlled by the Sassanids, then captured and pillaged in 640 in the Arab conquest of Armenia. They slaughtered 12,000 of its inhabitants and carried 35,000 into slavery. Dvin became the center of the province of Arminiya, the Arabs called the city Dabil.<br /> Frequent earthquakes and continued warfare led to the decline of the city from the beginning of the 10th century. During a major earthquake in 893, the city was destroyed, along with most of its 70,000 inhabitants.<br /> Although Armenia was a battleground between Arabs and Byzantine forces for the next two centuries, in the 9th century it still flourished. In 1236, the city was destroyed by Mongols.</p><p><strong>VAGHARSHAPAT<br /> </strong>As the main shrine of Armenian Christians worldwide, Etchmiadzin has been an important location in Armenia not only religiously, but also politically and culturally. A major pilgrimage site, it is one of the most visited places in the country.<strong><br /> CATHEDRAL and CHURCHES of ECHMIATSIN and the ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE of ZVARTNOTS </strong><br /> <strong>Echmiatsin Cathedral.</strong> This is the mother church of the Armenian Apostolic Church, located in the city of Vagharshapat (Etchmiadzin). According to most scholars, it was the first cathedral built in ancient Armenia and is often considered the oldest cathedral in the world.<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><br /> </sup>The original church was built in the early fourth century—between 301 and 303 according to tradition—by Armenia&#8217;s patron saint Gregory the Illuminator, following the adoption of Christianity as a state religion by King Tiridates III. It was built over a pagan temple, symbolizing the conversion from paganism to Christianity. The core of the current building was built in 483/4 by Vahan Mamikonian after the cathedral was severely damaged in a Persian invasion. From its foundation until the second half of the fifth century, Etchmiadzin was the seat of the Catholicos, the supreme head of the Armenian Church.<br /> Although never losing its significance, the cathedral subsequently suffered centuries of virtual neglect. In 1441 it was restored as catholicosate and remains as such to this day. Since then the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin has been the administrative headquarters of the Armenian Church. Etchmiadzin was plundered by Shah Abbas I of Persia in 1604 when relics and stones were taken out of the cathedral to New Julfa to undermine Armenians&#8217; attachment to their land. Since then the cathedral has undergone several renovations. Belfries were added in the latter half of the seventeenth century and in 1868 a sacristy was constructed at the cathedral&#8217;s east end. Today, it incorporates styles from different periods of Armenian architecture. Diminished during the early Soviet period, Etchmiadzin revived again in the second half of the twentieth century, and under independent Armenia.<br /> As the main shrine of Armenian Christians worldwide, Etchmiadzin has been an important location in Armenia not only religiously, but also politically and culturally. A major pilgrimage site, it is one of the most visited places in the country. Along with several important early medieval churches located nearby, the cathedral was listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2000.<br /> This church has a 12-sided drum dome, a bell tower with 8 columns supporting the top dome and a tower on each side. The early frescoes inside the cathedral were restored in the 18th century. Stepanos Lehatsi (Stephen of Poland) illustrated the belfry in 1664. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Armenian painters created frescoes of scenes from the Old Testament and Armenian saints. The painting of the Mother of God under the altar have survived to this day. <sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESahinianZarianGhazarian197872–73_144-0" class="reference"></sup>The wooden doors of the cathedral were carved in Tiflis in 1889.</p><p><noscript><img decoding="async" class="irc_mi" src="https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/16/14/b7/6e/303-484-1441-2000-iii.jpg" alt="Image result for Echmiatsin Cathedral." width="621" height="448" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload irc_mi" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20621%20448%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/16/14/b7/6e/303-484-1441-2000-iii.jpg" alt="Image result for Echmiatsin Cathedral." width="621" height="448" /><noscript><img decoding="async" class="irc_mi" src="https://phoenixtour.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/04-CATHEDRAL-INTERIOR.jpg" alt="Image result for Echmiatsin Cathedral." width="619" height="369" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload irc_mi" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20619%20369%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://phoenixtour.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/04-CATHEDRAL-INTERIOR.jpg" alt="Image result for Echmiatsin Cathedral." width="619" height="369" /></p><p><strong>Holy Mother of God.</strong> (St Mariam Ashvatsatsin).
