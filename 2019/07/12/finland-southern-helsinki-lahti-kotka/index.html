MUSEUM CARDS<br /> </strong><strong>Finland Museum Card</strong>. Gives free entry to 280 museums throughout Finland plus 40 in Helsinki for 12 months. Available online and at all included museums. €69<br /> This is an incredible deal for me as I see so many museums and don’t use the other attractions or restaurants. The only similar country with a museum card for the whole country is the Netherlands which I bought and got at least five times the value.<br /> Theoretically, the real card is mailed to you so you would need an address where you could receive the card in 1-3 weeks. I used the temporary card and it worked fine.<br /> <strong>Helsinki Card</strong>. Includes free admission to all Helsinki museums plus reduced prices at many attractions but I only use the museum part of the card and it works out to be not as good value for me. Pay more to include travel including to and from the airport (in brackets) &#8211; €42 (54) for 24 hours, €49 (61) for 48 hours, €55 (71) for 72  hours.<br /> <strong>2. Finland is a very</strong> <strong>civilized</strong> country. Almost everyone speaks good English with only a slight accent. They were voted the happiest country in the world in 2018 replacing the Danes who don’t seem happy and certainly aren’t friendly. The few Finns I have met are friendly. Bicycles are common (most wearing helmets) as are people exercising. Garbage cans are rare – in this way they are very much like Japan where you never see a garbage can – they make people responsible for their own trash and keep the costs of garbage collection low, but they require a responsible public. Lidl stores (my favorite grocery store) are common. Wifi can often be found free and password-free. There are more blonds here than in any other country I have been to. The women are not the thin “fashionistas” seen in Eastern Europe where the men prefer very thin women.<br /> <strong>3. Driving and Parking.</strong> In Helsinki, one must contend with 3 things: trams are everywhere and usually control the center lane of most roads; the many cyclists complicate driving as it is one more thing to look out for; there are also many battery-powered scooters but those are everywhere in Europe; many signs are on large concrete bases that make parking more hazardous. They are nice drivers, considerate, and relatively patient. Parking in Helsinki has been very easy. But secondary roads have multiple speed limits and many cameras (I have never seen a country that obeys speed limits like Fins)<br /> <strong>4. Costs.</strong> It is certainly more expensive than where I have just come from, Eastern Europe but that is the cheapest part of Europe. Diesel is €135.9-143.9 (€133.9 in Tallinn and 125-126 in south Estonia and twice the price in Belarus). Restaurant food is out of sight (pizza is twice what it was in Tallinn). A soft ice cream cone is €4.50, a doughnut €3.50. Lidl food prices seem equal to elsewhere in Europe so I will be back to cooking my own meals.<br /> But the Museum Card will balance everything out. I paid for it on my first day.</p><p><strong>Currency</strong>: Euro €</p><p><strong>FERRY – Tallinn, Estonia to Helsinki. Finland<br /> </strong>There are three companies that provide ferry services across the Gulf of Finland. <a href="http://www.laevapiletid.ee">www.laevapiletid.ee</a> is a great website that pools all three and provides easy comparison of times and costs for the particular day you want to cross. I used Eckero Line and booked the day before for travel on July 9. The 18:30 sailing was the cheapest one at €53 for a vehicle and one passenger. This was unbelievably cheap and a perfect time for me. Costs seem to go up the closer one is to your sailing date.<br /> Another advantage of the VW California is ferry costs. At 4.9m long and slightly less than 1.9m high, it qualifies as a car and has the cheapest price. The most expensive cost was with Viking at 6 a.m. for €120.<br /> There is no need to print your ticket. Simply write down your booking number and give it at the check-in booth at the Echero terminal. I had no wait at the booth and luckily moved past all the lines and boarded quickly.<br /> The crossing takes 2½ hours. As nighttime is so short at this latitude, I arrived in Helsinki with a couple of hours of light.<br /> The ferry has only lounge and restaurant seating. There were at least 3 bars and one restaurant (buffet €30). People board and run upstairs to get a seat. I ended up on a narrow stool directly over the stern (arguably the best view on the boat), but could have asked someone to share their table. I had bought a sandwich in town and avoided the ferry costs. There are several video gaming rooms and fast free Wi-Fi.</p><p><strong>HELSINKI/ESPOO/VANTAA</strong><br /> <em>I arrived late into Helsinki on the ferry from Tallinn, Estonia, and slept outside this museum complex with good free wifi. I bought the Finland Museum Card here. </em></p><p><u>Day 1<br /> </u><em>I spent most of the morning and early afternoon getting caught up on my web site and doing business. It was then a drive-about to see some of the museums and sights in south Helsinki. </em></p><p><strong>Hotel and Restaurant Museum.</strong> In a complex of three museums (others were photography and theater), this is a clever museum with some interesting exhibits, especially the Scent bar – press a lever and guess the scent. The history of alcohol, hotels, restaurants, and entertainment are dealt with. €10, 5 reduced*<br /> <strong>Finland Museum of Photography</strong>. I don’t know who picks the photography for these museums but it is universally mediocre at best. Subjects, composition, and use of light is poor. Some of the pictures were beautifully printed but otherwise indifferent. €10, 5 reduced*<br /> <strong>Computer &amp; Game Console Museum.</strong> On the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> floors of the Verkkokauppa Building, there are two small rooms with glass cases of all the early gaming consoles. It all started in 1980 and mushroomed after the Commodore 64 came out. There was no fee to see this.<br /> <strong>Bad Bad Boy.</strong> Just outside the main doors of Verkokkauppa, is this 8.5m tall, wide-eyed, almost alien-looking, nude boy with a penis that shoots a large spray of water out continuously. It was first unveiled in 2014 as part of the <em>Mutatis Mutandis </em>exhibition of the work of artist Tommi Toija, The statue originally stood adjacent to ferry terminals and waterfront tourist amusements. After the show closed in October 2016, the statue was moved to a permanent home in the city’s West Harbour. Some photo angles might make it look like the statue is now being used to water a landscaped area, but don’t worry: It’s just</p><p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="irc_mi" src="https://beautifulhelsinki.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/20140906-045600.jpg" alt="Image result for bad bad boy helsinki" width="400" height="533" data-iml="1562995688681" /><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Hietalahti Flea Market.</strong> Truly a very low-key market: completely open air, folding tables, clothes, and personal “junk”. It must operate only in good weather.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Sinebrychoff Art Museum</strong>. Blue and gold as pigments (lapis lazuli, cobalt blue, indigo. Prussian blue). Upstairs is the House collection of the 1700s and 1800s art, porcelain, and furniture. €15, 13 reduced*</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Päivälehti Museum.</strong> This media and freedom of speech museum is excellent using interactive video in many languages. Free</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Design Museum.</strong> Forest harvesters. Angry Birds and Clash of the Clans, Glass, Nokia and hundreds of other products have a Finnish origin. Song and Olin, two Finnish designers are profiled on the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor. Brilliant museum. €12, 10 reduced*</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Museum of Finnish Architecture.</strong> The temporary exhibit was on Suur-Merijoki Manor, one of the most famous of Finnish houses with drawings by one of the architects, Eliel Saarinen. Art nouveau in style, it was built in 1903. It had a large cross-vaulted hall and 30 rooms. It was destroyed in WW II in 1944 and that is why the beautiful drawings became so important. Also an exhibit on drawing and architecture, a travel sketchbook. The 2nd-floor permanent exhibition traces Finnish trends since 1900 as war, economics, availability of materials, and changes in styles dictated urban planning, housing, office buildings, and schools. €10. 8 reduced*</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Ursa Observatory </strong>(Kaivopuisto Observatory). This is a tiny (3.5m diameter) yellow/white building on top of a tiny hill near the water in south Helsinki. Times of opening are only when the skies are clear. €4</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Nighttime viewing: 7-9 pm – Oct 15-Dec 15 and Jan 15-March 15.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Sun viewing: 1-3 pm – March 15–June 15 and Aug 1-Oct 15.</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>I parked within meters of the water near the observatory. A waterside promenade was busy with people out for a stroll on a lovely July evening. Sailboats, speedboats, and jet skis entered the harbor.</em> <em>I don’t think electric scooters are an improvement in lifestyle – most everyone is young and healthy and not walking (if used to commute, they are a big asset).</em> <em>There is a lot of exposed rock in the park across the street, all of it heavily glacier-scoured.<br /> As I parked here with my door wide open, there were two groups of people who stopped, a drunk older Norwegian couple from Tromso who gave me the advice to drive there and four drunk teenagers who I quite enjoyed talking to. </em></span></p><p><u>Day 2<br /> </u><em>I had a much-needed shower at the sea pool. Most expensive and longest shower of my life. Also had a sauna. </em><em>€14<br /> I parked on a side street across from the market just touching the crosswalk lines but behind the line of the buildings &#8211; and got a €80 parking ticket. </em><br /> <strong>Market Square.</strong> An open-air market with vendors under tents. Knick-knacks, clothes, little old ladies knitting caps and toques, food vendors. Supposedly opens at 11 but opens at 9 am. Cruise ships dock here and up to 12,000 visitors arrive on busy days.</p><p><strong>FORTRESS OF SUOMENLINNA<br /> Getting There</strong>: The only World Heritage Site in Helsinki, it is on six islands and was called Viaport until 1918. It is accessed only by ferry from Market Square year around. In the summer from May 1<sup>st</sup> to September 30, a water taxi also operates. The trip takes 15-20 minutes and offers great views of Helsinki and the surroundings. Different boats stop off at Vallisaari and Lonna on either the outbound or return trip. It arrives at the pier on the north side of the island.<br /> Part of the city transport system and all HSL tickets are accepted. Single tickets €2.80 one way. Leaves every 20 minutes<br /> <strong>History.</strong> Sweden had lost its superpower status and its most important eastern fortresses in the wars with Russia in the first half of the 1700s. As a result, after the Russo-Swedish War of 1741-43, the maritime fortress and base for the Archipelago fleet was built on each of the liked islands beginning in 1748. A dry dock was included in the fortress for building warships for the fleet, the first in the world. 16 ships (specially designed for the shallow waters of the archipelago) were built. After WW II ships were built for the Soviet Union as war reparations. A windmill was used to drain the dry dock and saw lumber. Up to 7000 men were involved in the project in 1750 but because of lack of resources, only a sea fortress was built. The Bastion fortress was strongly influenced by the ideas of Vauban, the foremost military engineer of the time on the principles of a star fort style adapted to a group of rocky islands. It had 8kms or defensive walls, 7000 men, and over 600 canons. It was called Sveaborg, the fortress of Sweden”<br /> Construction continued until 1808 when Viapori was besieged by Russian forces in the Russo-Swedish War. After minor skirmishes, the Swedish commander surrendered – why remains an unsolved mystery. The Russians took over Viaport and a new era began.<br /> The Russians built more barracks, extended the dockyard and reinforced the fortification lines. The British, as part of the Crimean War (1853-56) badly damaged the fortress but were unable to knock out the Russian guns. New earthworks and artillery emplacements on the west and south were built after the war. Leading up to WW I, the fortress was an important safeguard for St Petersburg. It became part of Finland after 1917, the name was changed to Suomenlinna (“Castle of Finland”). and a prison camp with 260 executions, 69 at Suoenlinna. It ceased being a military base in 1973 but still has a Naval Academy of the Finnish Navy.<br /> It is a very busy summer tourist spot with 713,000 visits in 2009. There are 900 permanent residents and 350 work there year-round. A service tunnel supplies heat, water, electricity, and emergency transport. The Nordic Arts Center with studios and a summer theatre operates. There are many cafes, restaurants, shops, a hotel, a church, a library, a grocery store, a hostel, and bars on the island. It is possible to sail on the Cannon Sloop Diana (€25) lasting for 1¾ hours. <em><br /> </em>There are 8 islands (total area 50 hectares) with 5 connected by bridges.

Mannerheim served as the military leader of the Whites in the Finnish Civil War, Regent of Finland (1918–1919), commander-in-chief of Finland&#8217;s defense forces during World War II, Marshal of Finland, and the sixth president of Finland (1944–1946).<br /> Mannerheim made a career in the Imperial Russian Army where he served for 30 years, rising to the rank of lieutenant general. After the Bolshevik revolution, Finland declared its independence but was soon embroiled in a civil war between the pro-Bolshevik &#8220;Reds&#8221; and the &#8220;Whites&#8221;, who were the troops of the Senate of Finland, supported by troops of the German Empire. Mannerheim was appointed the military chief of the Whites. Twenty years later, when Finland was twice at war with the Soviet Union from November 1939 until September 1944, Mannerheim successfully led the defense of Finland as commander-in-chief of the country&#8217;s armed forces. In 1944, when the prospect of Germany&#8217;s defeat in World War II became clear, Mannerheim was elected President of Finland and oversaw peace negotiations with the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom. He resigned the presidency in 1946 and died in 1951.<br /> In a Finnish survey 53 years after his death, Mannerheim was voted the greatest Finn of all time. Given the broad recognition in Finland and elsewhere of his unparalleled role in establishing and later preserving Finland&#8217;s independence from Russia, Mannerheim has long been referred to as the father of modern Finland, and the Finnish capital Helsinki&#8217;s Mannerheim Museum memorializing the leader&#8217;s life and times has been called &#8220;the closest thing there is to a [Finnish] national shrine&#8221;. In addition, he is the only Finn to have held the rank of field marshal, an honorary rank bestowed upon especially distinguished generals.

Stockmann Aktiebolag. The shareholders were Stockmann and his two sons, Karl and Frans. Stockmann died in 1906. In 1930, the Stockmann, Helsinki centre store was finished, complete with revolving doors, a soda fountain, and escalators.

His work includes architecture, furniture, textiles and glassware, as well as sculptures and paintings, though he never regarded himself as an artist, seeing painting and sculpture as &#8220;branches of the tree whose trunk is architecture.&#8221; Aalto&#8217;s early career runs in parallel with the rapid economic growth and industrialization of Finland during the first half of the twentieth century and many of his clients were industrialists; among these were the Ahlström-Gullichsen family. The span of his career, from the 1920s to the 1970s, is reflected in the styles of his work, ranging from Nordic Classicism of the early work, to a rational International Style of Modernism during the 1930s to a more organic modernist style from the 1940s onwards.<br /> What is typical for his entire career, however, is a concern for design as a Gesamtkunstwerk, a total work of art; whereby he – together with his first wife Aino Aalto – would design not just the building, but give special treatment to the interior surfaces and design furniture, lamps, and furnishings and glassware. His furniture designs are considered Scandinavian Modern using wood, and simplification. He held patents for various manufacturing processes, such as bentwood. The Alvar Aalto Museum, designed by Aalto himself, is located in what is regarded as his home city Jyväskylä.<br /> In Helsinki, his most famous work is Finlandia Hall.</p><p><strong>Museum of Technology</strong> (Tekniikan Museo).

The municipality was bilingual, with the majority being Finnish and the minority Swedish speakers.<br /> After the Treaty of Åbo in 1743 the border between Sweden and the Russian Empire was drawn on the Ahvenkoski rapid, dividing Pyhtää between the two states. Due to this the western side became known as Ruotsinpyhtää (Swedish Pyhtää). In 1744 Jakob Forsell and Anders Nohrström bought the local ironworks, which was renamed Strömfors after their surnames. In 1817 Strömfors became the official Swedish name for the municipality.<br /> The Ruotsinpyhtää church was built in 1771 from wood.

It was enlarged in 1882, a fire destroyed it in the 1880s and it was reconstructed in brick. Horses were used to bring the logs up from the river, they were cut into ½m lengths, barked, and then went to the grinders that could handle 17 cubic meters of wood per day. Water was added and the pulp entered “wet lap” machines that used screens and produced 70x100cm sheets. The sheets were pressed using rollers and 78° heat – this energy consumed 8X as much wood as that used to make the pulp. They were then dried for 3 weeks in a drying loft, a job done by women. Calendar machines rolled the sheets flat and produced a glazed surface. Each sheet was sorted individually and eventually exported to Russia, Great Britain, and Europe. 5 tonnes of pulpwood were produced daily and used hand labour throughout.<br /> Of the 100 employees, 40% were women. Employees lived in mill housing, there was an elementary school and progressively for 1890, a social program.<br /> The mill was probably outdated in 1922 when new owners bought the mill as the entire process was very labour-intensive. The mill closed in 1964, long after it was economically viable. The last shift had only 8 employees, all over 70. It was turned into a museum in 1992 and declared a WHS in 1996.<br /> This can only be seen by guided tour, there were no English tours available so I joined the Finnish tour, followed along with a summary card and watched the video with subtitles. After seeing the video with people running the machines, the tour was quite boring as not one word was said in English, but the ancient machinery was interesting as the mill is completely intact. €10, 8 reduced*</p><p><noscript><img decoding="async" class="irc_mi" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/6187/6026486068_91eec164b8_b.jpg" alt="Image result for Verla Groundwood and Board Mill" width="450" height="338" data-iml="1563214785872" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload irc_mi" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20450%20338%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://live.staticflickr.com/6187/6026486068_91eec164b8_b.jpg" alt="Image result for Verla Groundwood and Board Mill" width="450" height="338" data-iml="1563214785872" /><noscript><img decoding="async" class="irc_mi" src="https://www.werelderfgoedfotos.nl/images/galleries/28/full/5.Verla%20Groundwood%20and%20Board%20Mill.jpg" alt="Image result for Verla Groundwood and Board Mill" width="450" height="300" data-iml="1563214826012" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload irc_mi" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20450%20300%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://www.werelderfgoedfotos.nl/images/galleries/28/full/5.Verla%20Groundwood%20and%20Board%20Mill.jpg" alt="Image result for Verla Groundwood and Board Mill" width="450" height="300" data-iml="1563214826012" /></p><p><strong>Repovesi National Park.</strong> Formerly a site for intensive commercial forestry, the Repovesi area successfully transformed into a pristine national park.

There are 560 life-size sculptures, all painted and all unusual. The most special are the 200 or so men doing yoga poses and the 100 children doing gymnastics and lining the area around the house. The children’s parade and 30 line the driveway entering from the highway. There are animals, people flower pots, and many other unusual creations. The sculptures are not particularly lifelike but have an otherworldly quality with blank, sunken glass eyes and real teeth. Nonhuman figures include large treelike structures with cone-shaped branches. The gardens themselves are quite beautiful.<br /> While he lived, Rönkkönen was known as something of a recluse. Despite his status as a small-town paper mill worker, however, he was incredibly well-read and was said to have experienced the world through the page, and the many ethnicities of his statues suggest this. Though he never discouraged visitors, he remained aloof from the tourism activities that cropped up in response to the public’s interest in his unusual collection. Despite requests, he refused to showcase his work outside his private residence.<br /> Following the artist’s death, the sculpture garden and accompanying property was purchased by Finnish businessman Reino Uusitalo who visits about once a year and maintained by a pleasant fellow who sells art, books, and T-shirts and had a donation box (€2-5 suggested). In the NM “Bizzarium<strong><em>” </em></strong>series, this is one place not to miss and is right on the main highway with picnic tables and lots of parking.</p><p><noscript><img decoding="async" class="irc_mi" src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzLzM5OWM0Mjk5YjgzZDU5NjBjNGYyZDFjYTc5YWIzNzdjYThkZThkNzEucG5nIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCJ4MzkwPiJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcXVhbGl0eSA4MSAtYXV0by1vcmllbnQiXV0/399c4299b83d5960c4f2d1ca79ab377ca8de8d71.png" alt="Image result for Rönkkönen Sculpture Garden" width="400" height="270" data-iml="1563214917307" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload irc_mi" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20400%20270%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzLzM5OWM0Mjk5YjgzZDU5NjBjNGYyZDFjYTc5YWIzNzdjYThkZThkNzEucG5nIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCJ4MzkwPiJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcXVhbGl0eSA4MSAtYXV0by1vcmllbnQiXV0/399c4299b83d5960c4f2d1ca79ab377ca8de8d71.png" alt="Image result for Rönkkönen Sculpture Garden" width="400" height="270" data-iml="1563214917307" /><noscript><img decoding="async" class="irc_mi" style="font-size: 12px;" src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzL2Y2NWFmM2QxNzMwODYyYzFlZDA2NDU1YmIzNGFmZTg3ZWU1NGQ5MDgucG5nIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCJ4MzkwPiJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcXVhbGl0eSA4MSAtYXV0by1vcmllbnQiXV0/f65af3d1730862c1ed06455bb34afe87ee54d908.png" alt="Image result for Rönkkönen Sculpture Garden" width="400" height="316" data-iml="1563215238489" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload irc_mi" style="font-size: 12px;" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20400%20316%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzL2Y2NWFmM2QxNzMwODYyYzFlZDA2NDU1YmIzNGFmZTg3ZWU1NGQ5MDgucG5nIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCJ4MzkwPiJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcXVhbGl0eSA4MSAtYXV0by1vcmllbnQiXV0/f65af3d1730862c1ed06455bb34afe87ee54d908.png" alt="Image result for Rönkkönen Sculpture Garden" width="400" height="316" data-iml="1563215238489" /><noscript><img decoding="async" class="irc_mi" style="font-size: 12px;" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WP6WCKn8FrA/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Image result for Rönkkönen Sculpture Garden" width="400" height="225" data-iml="1563215107036" /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload irc_mi" style="font-size: 12px;" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20400%20225%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WP6WCKn8FrA/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Image result for Rönkkönen Sculpture Garden" width="400" height="225" data-iml="1563215107036" /></p><p><strong><em>GO TO FINLAND North and East </em></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="printfriendly pf-button pf-button-content pf-alignleft"> <a href="index.html#" rel="nofollow" onclick="window.print(); return false;" title="Printer Friendly, PDF & Email"> <noscript><img decoding="async" class="pf-button-img" src="https://cdn.printfriendly.com/buttons/printfriendly-pdf-email-button-md.png" alt="Print Friendly, PDF & Email" style="width: 194px;height: 30px;"  /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload pf-button-img" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://cdn.printfriendly.com/buttons/printfriendly-pdf-email-button-md.png" alt="Print Friendly, PDF & Email" style="width: 194px;height: 30px;"  /> </a></div></div></div><div id="entry-author-info"><div id="author-avatar"></div><div id="author-description"><h2> About admin</h2> I would like to think of myself as a full time traveler. I have been retired since 2006 and in that time have traveled every winter for four to seven months. The months that I am "home", are often also spent on the road, hiking or kayaking. 
I hope to present a website that describes my travel along with my hiking and sea kayaking experiences.<div id="author-link"> <a href="../../../../author/admin/index.html" rel="author"> View all posts by admin <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span> </a></div></div></div><div class="entry-utility"> This entry was posted in <a href="../../../../category/uncategorized/index.html" rel="category tag">Uncategorized</a>.
