It borders Myanmar (Burma) to the northwest, Laos to the northeast, Cambodia to the southeast and Malaysia to the south.<br /> With great food, a tropical climate, fascinating culture and great beaches, Thailand is a magnet for travellers the world over, easily one of the most accessibly exotic travel destinations on the planet.</p><p><strong>Destinations</strong><br /> Bangkok — Thailand&#8217;s bustling, frenetic capital.<br /> Ayutthaya — a historical city, UNESCO World Heritage Site and old capital of Siam<br /> Chiang Mai — de facto capital of Northern Thailand and the heart of Lanna culture<br /> Chiang Rai — gateway to the Golden Triangle in the far north bordering on Myanmar and Laos, ethnic minorities and mountain trekkings<br /> Kanchanaburi — home of the bridge over the River Kwai and numerous World War II museums<br /> Nakhon Ratchasima — largest city of the Isaan region<br /> Pattaya — one of the main tourist destinations, known for its outrageous nightlife<br /> Sukhothai — Thailand&#8217;s first capital, with amazing ruins still<br /> Surat Thani — home of the Srivijaya Empire, gateway to the Samui archipelago<br /> Chumphon — between Bangkok and Phuket in the gulf, gateway to Kho Tao<br /> Nakhon Pathom &#8211; north clockwise from Bangkok, where Buddhism first came to Thailand.<br /> Hua Hin &#8211; A famous beach resort town in Thailand, where there are many attractions.<br /> Samut Songkhram &#8211; Shell cities, Great lychee, King Rama 2 Memorial Park, Mae Kong River, Worship Luang Por Ban Lam.<br /> Krabi &#8211; An archipelago more than 130 island with white sandy beaches, clear sea, coral, and karst formations.

You can find almost anything here &#8211; thick jungle, crystal blue waters that feel more like a warm bath than a swim in the ocean, and food that can curl your nose hairs while tap dancing across your taste buds. Exotic, yet safe; cheap, yet equipped with every modern amenity you need, there is something for every interest and every price bracket, from beach front backpacker bungalows to some of the best luxury hotels in the world. And despite the heavy flow of tourism, Thailand retains its quintessential Thai-ness, with a culture and history all its own and a carefree people famed for their smiles and their fun-seeking sanuk lifestyle. Many travellers come to Thailand and extend their stay well beyond their original plans and others never find a reason to leave.<br /> This is not to say that Thailand doesn&#8217;t have its downsides, including the considerable growing pains of an economy where an agricultural laborer is lucky to earn 100 baht per day ($3) while the nouveau riche cruise past in their BMWs, Bangkok, the capital, is notorious for its traffic jams and rampant development has wrecked much of once-beautiful Pattaya and Phuket. In heavily touristed areas, some lowlifes have made scamming tourists into an art form.</p><p><strong>History</strong><br /> The earliest Thais are believed to have come from modern-day Yunnan and Guangxi in China. They settled along river valleys forming small farming communitiies that eventually came under the Khmer empire of present day Cambodia. Southern Thailand along the Malay peninsula was controlled by the Srivijaya empire from Sumatra/<br /> The earliest identifiably Thai kingdom was founded in Sukhothai in 1238, reaching its zenith under King Ramkhamhaeng in the 14th century before falling under the control of the kingdom of Ayuthaya, which ruled most of present-day Thailand and much of today&#8217;s Laos and Cambodia as well, eventually also absorbing the northern kingdom of Lanna. Ayuthaya was sacked in 1767 by the Burmese, but King Taksin regrouped and founded a new capital at Thonburi. His successor, General Chakri, moved across the river to Bangkok and became King Rama I, the founding father of the Chakri dynasty that rules (constitutionally) to this day.<br /> Known as Siam until 1939, Thailand is the only Southeast Asian country never to have been colonised by a foreign power, and is fiercely proud of the fact. A bloodless revolution in 1932 led to a constitutional monarchy. During World War II, while Japan conquered the rest of Southeast Asia, only Thailand was not conquered by the Japanese due to smart political moves. In alliance with Japan during World War II, Thailand became a US ally following the conflict. After a string of military dictatorships and quickly toppled civilian Prime Ministers, Thailand finally stabilized into a fair approximation of a democracy and the economy boomed through tourism and industry. Above it all presided King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX), the world&#8217;s longest-reigning monarch and a deeply loved and respected figure of near-mythic proportions.<br /> In September 2006, a swift and bloodless military coup overthrew populist tycoon Thaksin Shinawatra&#8217;s democratically elected but widely criticized government, exposing a fault line between the urban elite that has ruled Thailand and the rural masses that supported Thaksin. Thaksin went into exile and a series of unstable governments followed, with the successors of Thaksin&#8217;s Thai Rak Thai party and the royalist-conservative People&#8217;s Alliance for Democracy duelling both behind the scenes and, occasionally, out in the streets, culminating in Bangkok&#8217;s airports being seized and shut down for a week in November 2008. Currently, things are quiet, but the political scene remains in flux and the direction of the country once the ailing King passes away is a major question mark because of the perceived inadequacy of the current heir.<br /> Politics<br /> Thailand is a constitutional monarchy, with the king as a very highly respected and revered Head of State. The Thai parliament is bicameral, consisting of a Senate, of which about half are directly elected with each province electing one member, and the other half being appointed by a committee, as well as a lower house which is directly elected by the people. The Prime Minister is the Head of Government, and is usually the leader of the party with the most seats in the lower house.<br /> In practice, the king&#8217;s role is largely ceremonial, with the Prime Minister holding the most authority in government. However, the king and the royal family are still protected by strict lèse majesté laws, which stipulate long jail terms for anybody convicted of insulting the king or any other members of the royal family.</p><p><strong>Climate</strong><br /> Thailand is largely tropical, so it&#8217;s hot and humid all year around with temperatures in the 28-35°C range (82-95°F), a degree of relief provided only in the mountains in the far north of Thailand. The careful observer will, however, note three seasons:<br /> Cool: From November to the end of February, it doesn&#8217;t rain much and temperatures are at their lowest, although you will barely notice the difference in the south and will only need to pack a sweater if hiking in the northern mountains, where temperatures can fall as low as 5°C. This is the most popular time to visit and, especially around Christmas and New Year&#8217;s or at Chinese New Year a few weeks later, finding flights and accommodation can be expensive and difficult.<br /> Hot: From March to June, Thailand swelters in temperatures as high as 40°C (104°F).<br /> Rainy: From July to October, although it only really gets underway in September, tropical monsoons hit most of the country. This doesn&#8217;t mean it rains non-stop, but when it does, it pours and flooding is not uncommon.<br /> There are local deviations to these general patterns. In particular, the south-east coast of Thailand (including Ko Samui) has the rains reversed, with the peak season being May-October and the rainy off season in November-February.</p><p><strong>People</strong><br /> Thailand&#8217;s people are largely indigenous, although there are significant minorities of ethnic Chinese and assimilated Thai-Chinese throughout the country, Muslims in the south near the Malaysian border and hill tribes such as the Karen and the Hmong in the north of the country. The overwhelmingly dominant religion (95%) is Theravada Buddhism, although Confucianism, Islam, Christianity and animist faiths also jostle for position.</p><p><strong>Culture</strong><br /> Mainland Thai culture is heavily influenced by Buddhism. However, unlike the Buddhist countries of East Asia, Thailand&#8217;s Buddhists follow the Theravada school, which is arguably closer to its Indian roots and places a heavier emphasis on monasticism. Thai temples known as wats, resplendent with gold and easily identifiable with their ornate, multicoloured, pointy roofs are ubiquitous and becoming an orange-robed monk for a short period, typically the three-month rainy season, is a common rite of passage for young Thai boys and men.<br /> Famously brutal Thai boxing (muay Thai), derived from the military training of Thai warriors, is undoubtedly the country&#8217;s best known indigenous sport.<br /> In addition to the mainland Thai culture, there are many other cultures in Thailand including those of the &#8220;hill tribes&#8221; in the northern mountainous regions of Thailand (e.g., Hmong, Karen, Lisu, Lahu, Akha), the southern Muslims, and indigenous island peoples of the Andaman Sea.<br /> <strong>Calendar</strong><br /> In addition to the Gregorian calendar, Thailand also uses the Thai solar calendar, which is 543 years ahead. Thus, Thai year 2556 corresponds to the Western year 2013. Thai dates in English are often written as B.E., short for &#8220;Buddhist Era&#8221;.<br /> <strong>Holidays</strong><br /> Thailand has a lot of holidays, mostly related to Buddhism and the monarchy. Nobody celebrates all of them, except for banks, which seem to be closed a lot.<br /> <em>Makha Bucha</em> &#8211; falls on the full moon in of the fourth Lunar month, usually in February or March, and commemorates the spontaneous gathering of 1,250 people before the Buddha, which led to their ordination and subsequent enlightenment. At temples in Bangkok and throughout Thailand, Buddhists carry candles and walk around the main shrine three times in a clockwise direction.<br /> During <em>Chinese New Year</em>, Chinese Thais, who are numerous in Bangkok, celebrate by cleaning their houses and offering food to their ancestors. This is mainly a time of abundant feasting. Visit Bangkok&#8217;s Chinatown or Yaowarat to fully embrace the festivity.<br /> <em>Songkran</em> &#8211; undoubtedly the most fun holiday &#8211; is the celebration of the Thai New Year, sometime in April (officially April 13th to 15th, but the date varies in some locations). What started off as polite ritual to wash away the sins of the prior year has evolved into the world&#8217;s largest water fight, which lasts for three full days. Water pistols and Super Soakers are advised and are on sale everywhere. The best places to participate are Chiang Mai, the Khao San Road area in Bangkok and holiday resorts like Pattaya, Ko Samui and Phuket. Be advised that you will get very wet, this is not a spectator sport.<br /> Loy Krathong falls on the first full moon day in the twelfth month of the Lunar calendar, usually in November, when people head to rivers, lakes and even hotel swimming pools to float flower and candle-laden banana-leaf (or, these days, styrofoam) floats called krathong. The krathong is meant as an offering to thank the river goddess who gives life to the people. Thais also believe that this is a good time to float away your bad luck and many will place a few strands of hair or finger nail clippings in the krathong. According to tradition, if you make a wish when you set down your krathong and it floats out of sight before the candle burns out, your wish will come true. Some provinces have their own version of Loy Krathong, such as Sukhothai where a spectacular show takes place. To the North, Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai, have their own unique tradition of floating Kom or lit lantern balloons. This sight can be breath-taking as the sky is suddenly filled with lights, rivalling the full moon.<br /> <em>Coronation Day</em> (5 May) commemorates the crowning of the current King in 1950 (although his reign actually began on 9 June 1946 &#8211; making him not only the longest-serving monarch in Thai history, but also the world&#8217;s longest-serving current Head of State).<br /> <em>The King&#8217;s Birthday</em> (5 December) is the country&#8217;s National Day and also celebrated as Father&#8217;s Day, when Thais pay respect to and show their love for His Majesty the King.<br /> <em>The Queen&#8217;s Birthday</em> (12 August) is Mother&#8217;s Day, and is celebrated similarly if with a little less pomp.<br /> <em>Ploughing Ceremony</em> defined by the Royal Ploughing Ceremony . The old rite since ancient times to enhance the morale of the farmers . To commemorate the importance of agriculture to the economy of Thailand. The ceremony will be conducted at Sanam Luang.</p><p><strong>Get in</strong><br /> (A) Countries/territories that do not require a visa for stay up to 90 days:- Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru and South Korea.<br /> (B) Countries/territories that do not require a visa for stay up to 30 days: (30 days when entering by air; by land border only 14 days)- Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bahrain, Brunei, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kuwait, Laos, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Macau, Malaysia, Monaco, Mongolia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States and Vietnam.<br /> (C) Countries/territories that do not require a visa for stay up to 14 days or others (if indicated):- Cambodia, Ukraine.<br /> Those with passports from countries not widely known, including European city-states, or have problems with document forgery, should obtain a visa in advance from the nearest Thai embassy. This is true even if visa on arrival is technically permitted. There are reports of tourists being detained using valid passports not commonly presented in Thailand.<br /> Proof of onward transit :- long happily ignored by Thai immigration, has been known to be strictly applied in some instances (Indian passport holders beware). The requirement is for an international flight itinerary &#8211; NOT train, ferry, or other departure type. Airlines, who have to pay for  your return flight if Thai immigration doesn&#8217;t let you into the country, also check this and often will not let you board your flight for Thailand without it.) A print-out of an international e-ticket on a budget airline is sufficient to convince the enforcers, but those planning on continuing by land may have to get a little creative. Buying a fully refundable ticket and getting it refunded once in Thailand is also an option. Land crossings, on the other hand, are a very straightforward process and proof of onward journey is generally not required (Indian passport holders beware again&#8230; or anyone, if the border officials simply decide to uphold the bureaucracy).<br /> Overstaying :- Overstaying in Thailand is possible with 500 baht fine per day. It is fairly simple to avoid overstaying by doing a visa run to a neighbouring country overland or via a cheap flight.<br /> <strong>By plane</strong><br /> The main international airports in Thailand are at Bangkok and Phuket, and both are well-served by intercontinental flights. Practically every airline that flies to Asia also flies into Bangkok, this means there are plenty of services and the competition on the routes helps to keep the ticket prices down.<br /> International airports are also located at Hat Yai, Krabi, Ko Samui and Chiang Mai, though these are largely restricted to flights from other Southeast Asian countries. Kuala Lumpur and Singapore make excellent places to catch flights into these smaller Thai cities, meaning you can skip the ever-present touts and queues at Bangkok.<br /> Many low-cost carriers serve Thailand with Air Asia providing very cheap flights<br /> <strong>By road</strong><br /> Cambodia &#8211; six international border crossings. The highway from Siem Reap and the temples of Angkor via Poipet to Aranyaprathet, once the stuff of nightmares, is now merely bad and can usually be covered in less than 3 hours. The border crossing at Poipet remains the stuff of nightmares, however. The Cambodian side is merely slow. The Thai side is glacial: travellers queue (outdoors in the heat) to reach a queue (in the Immigration building) &#8211; typically two and one hours, respectively. An alternative is to head to Hatlek/ Cham Yeam towards Koh Kong; that crossing is quiet and honest with good communication links.<br /> Laos &#8211; the busiest border crossing is at the Friendship Bridge across the Mekong between Nong Khai and the Lao capital Vientiane. It&#8217;s also possible to cross the Mekong at Chiang Khong / Huay Xai, Nakhon Phanom / Tha Khaek, Mukdahan / Savannakhet, and elsewhere.<br /> Vientiane / Udon Thani &#8211; A bus service runs from the Morning Market bus station in Vientiane to the bus station in Udon Thani. The cost is 80 baht or 22,000 kip and the journey takes two hours. The Udon Thani airport is 30 minutes by tuk-tuk from the bus station and is served by Thai Airways, Nok Air and Air Asia.<br /> Malaysia and Singapore &#8211; driving up is entirely possible, although not with a rented vehicle. Main crossings (with name of town on Malaysian side in brackets) between Thailand and Malaysia are Padang Besar (Padang Besar) and Sadao (Bukit Kayu Hitam) in Songkhla province, Betong (Pengkalan Hulu) in Yala province, and Sungai Kolok (Rantau Panjang) in Narathiwat province. There are regular buses from Singapore to the southern hub of Hat Yai.<br /> Myanmar: Mae Sai / Tachileik &#8211; foreigners can access this crossing from either side, and enter and/or exit either country here; onward travel restrictions: since Oct 2009, onward travel by land to Kengtung is only possible if accompanied by an official guide (1,000 baht/day + expenses), exiting Myanmar at Tachilek is only possible for those who entered at his border crossing and were issued a 14-day entry permit; to get to Tachileik or Kengtung from the rest of Myanmar, a domestic flight must be taken (e.g., from Heho).<br /> Mae Sot / Myawaddy &#8211; This border crossing was closed in July 2010 and re-opened on 5 December 2011. When open, foreigners can only access this crossing from the Thai side; neither onward travel into Myanmar (ie beyond the Burmese border town of Myawaddy) nor overnight stays are possible. No visa is needed; instead there&#8217;s an entry stamp fee: US$10 if paid in dollars, more (500 baht) if paid with Thai currency.<br /> Three Pagodas Pass (Sangkhlaburi / Payathonzu) &#8211; foreigners can only access this crossing from the Thai side; onward travel into Myanmar (ie beyond the border town) is not possible; entry/exit stamps are NOT issued here, and foreigners passports are held at the Myanmar checkpoint, where a fee is levied: US$10 if paid in dollars, more (500 baht) if paid with Thai currency. However, as of November 25, 2008, this crossing is temporarily closed.<br /> Ranong / Kawthoung &#8211; foreigners can access this crossing from either side, and enter and/or exit either country here; no onward travel restrictions (other than those that apply to everyone, no matter how they enter); access to/from Kawthoung is by sea (Mergui/Dawei &#038; Yangon) and air (Mergui &#038; Yangon). If entering without a visa, maximum stay is 3 days / 2 nights, travel beyond Kawthoung is not permitted, and there&#8217;s an entry stamp fee: US$10 if paid in dollars, more (500 baht) if paid with Thai currency.<br /> <strong>By train</strong><br /> Thailand&#8217;s sole international train service links to Butterworth (near Penang) and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, continuing all the way to Singapore. Tickets are cheap even in first class sleepers, but it can be a slow ride; the 2-hour flight to Singapore will take you close to 48 hours by rail, as you have to change trains twice. The luxury option is to take the Eastern &#038; Oriental Express, a refurbished super-luxury train that runs along the same route once per week, with gourmet dining, personal butler service and every other colonial perk you can think of. However, at around US$1000 one-way just from Bangkok to Butterworth, this is approximately 30 times more expensive than an ordinary first-class sleeper!<br /> While you can&#8217;t get to Laos or Cambodia by train, you can get very close, with rail terminals just across the border at Nong Khai (across the river from Vientiane) and Aranyaprathet (for Poipet, on the road to Siem Reap). A link across to Mekong to Laos is open in March 2009, but service to Cambodia remains on the drawing board.<br /> There are no rail services to Myanmar, but the Thai part of the infamous Burma Death Railway is still operating near Kanchanaburi.<br /> <strong>By ferry</strong><br /> It is now possible in high-season (Nov-May) to island-hop using ferries from Phuket all the way to Indonesia. This can now be done without ever touching the mainland, Phuket (Thailand) to Padang (Indonesia). The Thai portion can be done in a day.<br /> Ferries cross from Satun in southern Thailand to the Malaysian island of Langkawi, while over in Narathiwat Province, a vehicular ferry shuttles between Tak Bai and Pengkalan Kubur, near Kota Bharu in Malaysia&#8217;s Kelantan state.<br /> There are also occasional cruises from Malaysia and Singapore to Phuket and Bangkok, the main operator being Star Cruises, but no scheduled services.</p><p><strong>Get around</strong><br /> <strong>By plane</strong><br /> Thailand is a large country, and if sitting in a bus for 11 hours is not your idea of a fun time, you may well want to consider domestic flights. Never terribly expensive to begin with (at least by Western standards), the deregulation of the industry has brought in a crop of new operators: with a little research, it&#8217;s possible to fly pretty much anywhere in the country for less than 2,000 baht. Note that various taxes and (often hefty) surcharges are invariably added to &#8220;advertised&#8221; prices.<br /> Thai airlines. Pan-ASEAN low cost carrier AirAsia has great coverage of international and domestic routes in Thailand and offers steeply discounted tickets if booked well in advance; however, prices rise steadily as planes fill up. It&#8217;s often the cheapest option, sometimes even cheaper than bus or train, if booked at least a week or two in advance. They fly their (quite new) A320s from Bangkok to a number of places domestically, as well as to Cambodia, China, Macau, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Vietnam and Indonesia. Recently, they started to display &#8220;all-inclusive&#8221; prices during booking (which, however, still do not include optional surcharges such as baggage fees). On-line booking is straightforward and can be done even using the mobile phone, but must be done at least twenty-four hours in advance; ticket sales at the check-in desk close one hour before the departure time.<br /> Bangkok Airways promotes itself as &#8220;Asia&#8217;s Boutique Airline&#8221;, and has a monopoly on flights to its own airports at Ko Samui (now shared with Thai Airways), Sukhothai and Trat. Quite an expensive and &#8220;posh&#8221; option; however, their Discovery Airpass  with fixed per segment rates can be good value, especially if used to fly to Siem Reap, (Cambodia) or Luang Prabang, (Laos). Note that the Discovery Airpass can now only be purchased from abroad.<br /> Nok Air took to the skies in 2004 sporting lurid paints scheme with a bird&#8217;s beak painted on the nose. Owned mostly by Thai Airways, they compete with Air Asia on price and, with a fairly comprehensive domestic network, are a pretty good choice overall.<br /> Orient Thai, until recently One-Two-Go, is easily the dodgiest of Thailand&#8217;s main carriers, flying a ragtag bunch of ancient planes with a poor safety record, including a crash in Phuket in 2007 that killed 90 people. The fleet has been grounded on and off, but as of late-2010 they&#8217;re flying again. Unlike most LCCs, their ticket prices don&#8217;t change much, meaning they&#8217;re often the cheapest option for last-minute flights, if you are not afraid. If you&#8217;re tall (above 6 feet), get an exit row seat unless you want to ride the whole flight with your knees resting against the seat in front.<br /> Thai Airways is the most reliable, frequent, and comfortable Thai airline, but usually more expensive than the alternatives (look for their promotions, though). Travel agents often sell only Thai Airways (and Bangkok Airways) tickets; you can also book on-line. Thai Airways is a member of Star Alliance; all domestic flights, except some promotional fares, give at least 500 Star Alliance miles, which may (partially) compensate the price difference.<br /> SGA Airline flies mostly in northern Thailand and is the only carrier offering flights between Chiang Mai-Pai, Mae Hong Son, Nan and Chiang Rai. They cooperate with Nok and Thai<br /> Jet Asia Airways is a Thai airline based out of Suvarnabhumi International Airport in Bangkok. The fleet is composed exclusively of Boeing 767 aircraft. Focusing on the Asian charter market, Jet Asia Airways offers full-service charter and ACMI flights.<br /> <strong>By train</strong>. SRT railway network<br /> State Railway of Thailand (SRT) has a 4,000-km network covering most of the country, from Chiang Mai in the north all the way to (and beyond) the Malaysian border in the south. Compared to buses, most trains are relatively slow and prone to delays, but safer. You can pick up fruits, snacks and cooked food from hawkers at most stations. Point-to-point fares depend on the type (speed) of the train and the class of the carriage. There are three main classes:<br /> First class (chan neung) 2-berth sleeping compartments with individually regulated air conditioning are available on some trains, but prices are sometimes matched by budget airfares.<br /> Second class (chan song) is a good compromise, costing about the same as 1st class buses and with a comparable level of comfort. Some 2nd class trains are air-con, others aren&#8217;t; air-con costs a little more. Second class sleeper berths are comfortable and good value, with the narrower upper bunks costing a little less than the wider lower bunks. Food and WCs are basic. 2nd class Express Railcar trains have reclining seats and refreshments are included in the fare; unlike all other Thai passenger trains, they can match buses for speed, but cannot carry bicycles.<br /> Third class (chan saam) is the cheapest way to travel in Thailand, with virtually nominal fares, and can be great fun. Sometimes packed with tuk-tuk drivers heading home with a sack of rice and a bottle of cheap whisky for company, as a farang (foreigner) you&#8217;re guaranteed to be the center of attention &#8211; quite enjoyable in small doses, but 10 hours of this might be a bit much. Some 3rd class trains have wooden seats, others are upholstered; some services can be pre-booked, others cannot; refreshments are available from hawkers who roam the aisles.<br /> Pre-booking is recommended, especially for sleeper berths. Tickets on all main lines can be purchased online at SRT&#8217;s official E-Stars site; however, only a quota of 10% of seats can be sold online, so it will often show trains as full when, in reality, there&#8217;s still plenty of space (Tip: if you get an error during registration &#8211; just remove any special characters from your registration data; you can always edit  your profile later). Alternatively, many travel agencies can book tickets for a service fee (50-200 baht/ticket), or you can reserve with SRT directly by e-mail at <a href="../../../../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4131203232242f2624336c322433013320282d3620386f222e6f3529">[email&#160;protected]</a> for a 200 baht/booking surcharge.<br /> Full information regarding routes, timetables, and up-to-date ticket costs along with interesting videos can be found at http://www.seat61.com by selecting &#8216;Asia&#8217; and then &#8216;Thailand&#8217;.<br /> <strong>By road</strong><br /> Thailand&#8217;s roads are head and shoulders above its neighbours Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia, but driving habits are still quite dangerous. Drunk driving, speeding and reckless passing are depressingly common, and bus and taxi drivers (especially for private companies) work inhuman shifts and often take drugs to keep themselves awake, with predictable and tragic results. It&#8217;s common for motorbikes — even police! — to drive close to the curb on the wrong side of the road. Death tolls sky-rocket around major holidays, especially Songkhran, when bystanders often throw water on passing cars and bikes. Many drivers don&#8217;t use headlights at night, multiplying risks, and it is wise to avoid or minimize overnight travel by road.<br /> Note that unlike in its neighbours (except Malaysia), traffic moves on the left side of the road in Thailand and Thai cars are generally right-hand drive. All official road directional signs are written in both Thai and English.<br /> Renting a car to explore on your own is a cost-effective way of getting off the beaten track, and avoids the constant hassle of haggling with local taxi/tuk-tuk drivers. Most major roads are marked in both Thai and English, and traffic culture is not as bad as some might lead you to believe. Keep a sharp lookout in both mirrors from passing traffic including 18-wheelers and scooters. Traffic on major highways follows 100-120 km/h, while smaller highways are generally 80 km/h. Gas stations are common and most Thai are more than willing to give directions in spite of any language barriers.<br /> Drive very defensively at first and watch what the locals do. Of course, it helps if  you are accustomed to driving on the left side of the road, which in itself could be enough to distract some North American or European drivers.<br /> Driving under the influence of alcohol is both illegal and dangerous, and driving at night also increased the risk of accidents — even if you&#8217;re sober, many others aren&#8217;t. Renting a car usually costs between 1200-1500 baht if you want to go for an economical one like a Toyota Vios . Most of the national companies can be found in Thailand . Also reputable local car rental companies, which are often a little cheaper, include:<br /> <strong>Bus</strong><br /> VIP? Very Inferior Product. Travel agencies, particularly those on Bangkok&#8217;s Khao San Road, are keen to sell you VIP bus tickets. These are more often than not cramped minibuses that will do their best to arrive late, often by breaking down right next to a conveniently located restaurant, and sell you to the guesthouse that gives them the highest commissions. Theft, particularly on routes to the south, is also a major problem. Thais never use them, opting for public BKS buses instead &#8211; and you should too.<br /> Buses travel throughout the country and the government&#8217;s bus company BKS, known in English simply as the The Transport Company, has a terminal in every province of any size. If the Transport Company&#8217;s website is difficult to read, try Sawasdee&#8217;s bus time tables.<br /> Generally speaking, BKS buses are the best option for both price and comfort. There are also private buses sanctioned by BKS, which operate on the same routes from the same terminals with the same fares, and these are also fine. The ones to watch out for are the illegal bus companies, which operate from tourist areas (especially Khao San Road) and subsidize slightly cheaper tickets with worse amenities, schedules and safety. In particular, beware of non-government &#8220;VIP&#8221; buses, which often turn out to be cramped minivans &#8211; and you&#8217;ll only find this out after paying in advance.<br /> Local &#8211; relatively slow, can be cramped when full (nevertheless there&#8217;s always room for one more), and stop at every village and cowshed along the way. Many are of larger songthaew flavour. Not suitable for long-distance travel, but may be the only cheap way to get around locally.<br /> Express &#8211; skip some stops, but no other frills. Identifiable by their orange colour. Size varies, with the largest having around 65 seats (five seats per row) as well as an open space across the width of the bus by the back door for you to sling your backpack, bicycle, sack of rice, live chickens, etc.<br /> Second class &#8211; skip more stops, but often take a less direct route than 1st class / VIP / S-VIP. Blue and white with an orange stripe, usually 45-48 seats per bus, air conditioned (some provide blankets, some do not). Most have no on-board toilet, although the frequent stops mean this isn&#8217;t a problem.<br /> First class &#8211; generally take the most direct routes and make very few stops. Blue and white in colour, air conditioned, blanket usually provided, fewer (larger, longer pitch) seats (typically 40, but some double-decker types seat 60+), snack and drinking water included. Toilet on board for all but the shortest services.<br /> &#8220;VIP&#8221; &#8211; as per 1st class, but with only 32-34 seats, which have more leg room and recline further. Basic meal included and freshly laundered shrink-wrapped blanket provided. Also blue and white (or sometimes blue and silver) but usually signed &#8220;VIP&#8221;.<br /> &#8220;S-VIP&#8221; &#8211; Super-VIP is very similar to VIP, except there are only 24 seats, which are wider &#8211; the aisle is offset, each row having a pair of seats on the right and only a single seat on the left. Primarily used on overnight services.<br /> Some buses may have TVs and sound systems blaring, so earplugs are well worth having, just in case. On long-haul buses, if your ticket allocates you a front seat, you may have to switch seats if a monk boards.<br /> Songthaew. A songthaew is a truck-based vehicle with a pair of bench seats in the back, one on either side — hence the name, which means &#8220;two rows&#8221; in Thai. In English tourist literature, they&#8217;re occasionally called &#8220;minibuses&#8221;. By far the most common type is based on a pick-up truck and has a roof and open sides. Larger types start life as small lorries, and may have windows, and an additional central bench; smaller types are converted micro-vans, with a front bench facing backwards and a rear bench facing forwards. Songthaews are operated extensively as local buses (generally the most economical way to travel shorter distances) and also as taxis; sometimes the same vehicle will be used for both. Be careful if asking a songthaew to take you to someplace if there is nobody in the back, the driver might charge you the taxi price. In this case, check the price of the ride before embarking.<br /> <strong>Tuk-tuk</strong>. The name tuk-tuk is used to describe a wide variety of small/lightweight vehicles. The vast majority have three wheels; some are entirely purpose-built (eg the ubiquitous Bangkok tuk-tuk), others are partially based on motorcycle components (primarily engines, steering, front suspension, fuel tank, drivers seat). A relatively recent development is the four wheeled tuk-tuk (basically a microvan-songthaew) as found in Phuket.<br /> Taxi. Metered taxis are ubiquitous in Bangkok and starting to become more popular in Chiang Mai, but rare elsewhere in the country. When available, they are an excellent means of transport &#8211; insist on the meter. Beware of taxis which idle around touristy areas and wait for people. They are looking for a tourist who will take their taxi without using a meter. Always use the meter!<br /> <strong>Motorbike</strong>. As is the case throughout virtually all of Asia, motorcycles (motosai) are the most common form of transport overall; the most popular type are the 100cc-125cc step-through models. These are very widely used as taxis, with fares starting from as low as 10 baht. Negotiate the fare with the driver before using his service otherwise you may be charged more than you expect.<br /> Motorcycles can be rented without difficulty in many locations. Rates start at around 125 baht/day for recent 100-125cc semi-automatic (foot operated gearchange, automatic clutch) step-through models, 150 baht/day for fully automatic scooters; larger capacity models can also easily be found, although the rates reflect the risks &#8211; up to around 2500 baht/day for the very latest model high capacity sport bikes, such as the Honda CBR1000RR. In all cases, lower prices will apply if paying upfront for more than a week or so; in some cases, long-distance travel may be prohibited. Motorcycle rentals do not include insurance, and both motorcycling accidents and motorbike thefts are common.<br /> Many places will rent to you without requiring a license, but legally speaking you must have a valid Thai license or International Driver&#8217;s Permit. Often a deposit will be required; sometimes a passport photocopy, or even the passport itself (don&#8217;t do this- bargain to leave some baht instead), will be requested. Helmets are normally included, but are usually ultra-basic models with very flimsy chin-strap fasteners &#8211; if you&#8217;re intending to travel by motorcycle and have a good quality helmet at home, then bring it with you. If supplied a helmet with a chin-cup (many cheap rental helmets are), slide the cup up the strap out of the way and securely fasten the bare strap directly under the jaw, as this is much safer.<br /> Insurance is usually not included (or even available), so try to ensure in advance that the insurance you leave home with is going to cover you; alternatively, arrange cover with an insurance broker locally in Thailand. If you rent a vehicle without insurance and it&#8217;s damaged or stolen, the bottom line is that  you will be required to pay in full the cost of repairing or replacing it. Furthermore, some travel insurance policies will only provide medical cover in the event of an accident if you hold a motorcycle license in your home country.<br /> Motorcyclists (including passengers) are required to wear crash helmets and to keep their headlights switched on at all times. Enforcement varies widely, but in tourist areas spot checks for helmets and/or licences are commonplace. While the fines are light (typically 400 baht) the inconvenience can be considerable as offender&#8217;s vehicle is impounded until the fine is paid, and the queue at the police station can be lengthy.<br /> Some (but not all) border crossings allow motorcycles through. At those which do, documentation including proof of ownership must be produced (with the possible exception of day visits to Payathonzu, Myanmar via Three Pagodas Pass).<br /> Rental car. Driving your own car in Thailand is not for the faint-hearted, and many rental companies can supply drivers at a very reasonable price. Prices without insurance for a self-driven car start from around 900 baht/day for small cars, and from as little as 570 baht/day for open-top jeeps; cars with insurance start at just under 1000 baht/day, and come down to around 5,600 baht/week or 18,000 baht/month.<br /> Driving is (usually, but not always!) on the left hand side of the road.<br /> Cars can be rented without difficulty in many locations. It&#8217;s worth paying a little more than the absolute minimum to use one of the international franchises (eg Avis, Budget, and Hertz) to minimize the risk of hassles, and to ensure that any included insurance is actually worth something.<br /> More reputable agencies require that  valid licences be produced: foreigners who do not have a Thai driving licence must carry a valid International Driving Permit. Even if you manage to rent a car without an IDP, not having one will invalidate the insurance and count against you in the event of an accident.<br /> A common rental scam involves the owner taking a deposit, and then later refusing to refund it in full on the basis that the customer is responsible for previous damage; the Tourist Police (dial 1155) may be able to help. Another common scam involves the owner having someone follow the rented vehicle and later &#8220;steal&#8221; it, using a set of spare keys. Always report thefts: a &#8220;stolen&#8221; vehicle may mysteriously turn up as soon as the police become involved.<br /> <strong>By boat</strong>. One of the Thais&#8217; many names for themselves is jao naam, the Water Lords, and from the river expresses of Bangkok to the fishing trawlers of Phuket, boats remain an indispensable way of getting around many parts of the country.<br /> Perhaps the most identifiably Thai boat is the long-tail boat (reua hang yao), a long, thin wooden boat with the propeller at the end of a long &#8216;tail&#8217; stretching from the boat. This makes them supremely manouverable even in shallow waters, but they&#8217;re a little underpowered for longer trips and you&#8217;ll get wet if it&#8217;s even a little choppy. Long-tails usually act as taxis that can be chartered, although prices vary widely &#8211; figure on 300-400 baht for a few hours&#8217; rental, or up to 1500 for a full day. In some locations like Krabi, long-tails run along set routes and charge fixed prices per passenger.<br /> Modern, air-conditioned speedboat services, sometimes ferries (departure every 30 mins) also run from the Surat Thani to popular islands like Ko Samui and Ko Pha Ngan. Truly long-distance services (eg. Bangkok to any other major city) have, however, effectively ceased to exist as buses, planes and even trains are faster. Safety measures are rudimentary and ferries and speedboats do sink occasionally, so avoid overloaded ships in poor weather, and scope out the nearest life jackets when on board.</p><p><strong>See</strong><br /> Wats for dummies. A Thai temple is known as a wat. Usually a temple does not consist of one building, but is a collection of buildings, shrines and monuments enclosed by a wall. There are thousands of temples in Thailand, and nearly every town or village has at least one. The word &#8220;wat&#8221; literally means school, and the temple has been the only place where formal education took place for centuries. A typical Buddhist wat consists of the following structures:<br /> Bot — The holiest prayer room, usually only open to the monks. It is architecturally similar to the viharn, but is usually more heavily decorated and it has eight cornerstones to ward off evil. It is also known as the &#8220;ordination hall&#8221; as it is where the monks take their vows.<br /> Viharn — Usually the busiest room in a wat, it is where the temple&#8217;s main Buddha image is and where people come to make offerings. It is open for everyone.<br /> Chedi or stupa — A tall bell-shaped structure that generally houses relics of the Buddha.<br /> Prang — A finger-like spire of Khmer and Ayutthayan origin that serves the same religious purpose as a chedi.<br /> Mondop — An open, square building with four arches and a pyramidal roof. It is often used to worship religious texts or objects.<br /> Sala — An open-sided pavilion that is used for relaxation and as a meeting place (and often used as a shelter for rain).<br /> Chofah — Bird-like decorations on the end of temple roofs. They are meant to represent the Garuda, a mythical creature that is half-bird, half-man.<br /> Historical and cultural attractions<br /> Bangkok is at the start of many visitors&#8217; itineraries, and while a modern city, it has a rich cultural heritage. Most visitors at least take in the Grand Palace, a collection of highly decorated buildings and monuments. It is home to Wat Phra Kaew, the most sacred Buddhist temple in Thailand that houses the Emerald Buddha. Other cultural attractions include Wat Pho, Wat Arun and Jim Thompson&#8217;s House, but these are just a fraction of possible sights you could visit.<br /> The former capitals of Siam, Ayutthaya and Sukhothai, make excellent stops for those interested in Thai history. The latter could be combined with a visit to Si Satchanalai and Kamphaeng Phet, all of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Khmer architecture is mostly found in Isaan, with the historical remains of Phimai and Phanom Rung being the most significant.<br /> In the northern provinces live unique hill-tribe peoples, often visited as part of a trekking. The six major hill tribes in Thailand are the Akha, Lahu, Karen, Hmong, Mien and Lisu, each with a distinct language and culture. Chiang Mai makes a good base for arranging these trekkings, and has some cultural sights of its own, such as Wat Doi Suthep.<br /> For those interested in recent history, Kanchanaburi has a lot of sights related to World War II. The Bridge over the River Kwai, popularised by the film of the same name, is the most famous one, but the museums in its vicinity are a lot more moving.<br /> <em>Beaches and island</em>s. Thailand&#8217;s beaches and islands attract millions of visitors each year from all over the globe. Hua Hin is Thailand&#8217;s oldest beach resort, discovered by King Rama VII in the 1920s as an ideal getaway from Bangkok. Things have considerably changed since then. While Pattaya, Phuket and Ko Samui were only discovered in the 1970s, these are now by far the most developed beach resorts.<br /> Krabi Province has some beautiful spots, including Ao Nang, Rai Leh and the long golden beaches of Ko Lanta. Ko Phi Phi, renowned as a true paradise island, has been undergoing massive development since the release of the film The Beach in 2000. Ko Pha Ngan gives the best of both worlds, with well-developed beaches and empty ones a short ride away.<br /> Ko Chang is a bit like Ko Samui used to be, it has a backpacker  vibe, but is fairly laid-back and there is accommodation in all price ranges. If you&#8217;re looking for unspoiled beaches, Ko Kut is very thinly populated, but also difficult to explore. Ko Samet is the closest island beach to Bangkok, but its northern beaches are quite developed and hotels are pretty much sold out on weekends and public holidays.<br /> <em>Natural scenery</em>. While not as beautiful as Malaysia or Indonesia, Thailand does have its fair share of tropical forest. Khao Yai National Park, the first national park of Thailand, is the closest to Bangkok. Wild tigers and elephants are increasingly rare, but you can&#8217;t miss the macaques, gibbons, deer, and species of birds. The stretch of jungle at Khao Sok National Park is probably even more impressive, and you can spend the night in the middle of the jungle.<br /> Waterfalls can be found all over Thailand. The Heo Suwat Waterfall in Khao Yai National Park and the 7-tiered Erawan Falls in Kanchanaburi are among the most visited, but the Thee Lor Sue Waterfall in Umphang and the 11-tiered Pa La-u Falls in Kaeng Krachan National Park are equally exciting. Finally, the gravity-defying limestone formations of the Phang Nga Bay shouldn&#8217;t be missed by anyone who stays in the region.<br /> <em>Movies</em>. There are many movie theaters in Thailand if you want to take a night off and rest. Just remember, there is always 30 min of comercials before the film. As most of the locals do, arrive late.<br /> <em>Pampering</em>. In Thailand, massage is viewed as much more than the physical treatment it often is in the West; it draws on a number of traditions from neighboring countries – including India and China – and has much more of a philosophical, psychological basis. In particular, it combines elements from reflexology, acupressure, and assisted yoga into one all-encompassing method that does much more than simply relax muscles and alleviate pain.<br /> Although spas in Thailand did not take off for tourists until the early 1990s, it quickly became apparent that this was an industry tailor made for the Kingdom. Given that there already existed a very deep an extensive knowledge of natural remedies and herbal properties, it was a logical step to make this knowledge available to tourists in venues and locations that were amenable to this market.<br /> Spas and wellness centers now exist throughout Thailand, with the larger and more exclusive ones concentrated in the main tourist destinations of Bangkok, Pattaya, Phuket, Koh Samui, Chiang Mai, and Hua Hin. That said, almost any town or hotel of any size will offer some type of massage, sauna, or spa treatment, which adds great value for tourists to traveling throughout Thailand.<br /> Thailand has quickly become one of the highest ranking spa destinations in the world. Besides traditional Thai massage, there is a phenomenal variety of international treatments, including aromatherapy, Swedish massage and many others. There is usually an option for every budget, varying from extravagant wellness centers in the five star hotels to the ubiquitous little massage shops found on many street corners.<br /> <em>Outdoors</em><br /> Thailand&#8217;s a big enough country that you can find a place to practice almost any outdoor sport. Ko Tao is becoming one of Asia&#8217;s great Scuba diving centres, while the Ang Thong National Marine Park near Ko Samui and the Similan Islands also draw the crowds. One of the newest hot spots for diving is Ko Lipe, a small island that is amazingly unspoilt with great reefs and absolutely stunning beaches. Snorkeling can be done at pretty much at every beach, but coral reefs of the Similan Islands stand out as particularly worthwhile.<br /> While Thailand does not match surf paradises like Bali, surfing does have its place. The waves are generally small, good for longboarding and those wanting to learn to surf. Khao Lak and Phuket&#8217;s west coast beaches are among the better ones, but the best waves are to be found at the relatively unknown Ko Kradang at the west coast of Trang Province. Other surf-spots include Rayong and Ko Samui, but the waves of the Gulf Coast are less reliable.<br /> Phang Nga Bay&#8217;s gravity-defying limestone formations are usually seen with boat tours, but if you go sea-canoeing, you can get into areas unexplored by the tourist masses. The limestone cliffs of Rai Leh are arguably among the best in the world for rock-climbing.<br /> <em>Wildlife</em> of Thailand has much to offer. From tigers and elephants to monkeys and birds, there are many new species to discover in Thailand.</p><p><strong>Language</strong>. The official language of Thailand is Thai. Like Mandarin and Vietnamese, Thai is a tonal language (think about the difference in your voice when saying &#8220;yes.&#8221; versus &#8220;yes?&#8221; &#8211; that&#8217;s tonal) which can make it tricky for speakers of non-tonal languages to learn quickly, but despite this, everyone will appreciate any attempt you do make so pick up a phrasebook and give it a go. Thai is a language with many dialects, though the Bangkok dialect, also known as Central Thai, is used as the standard and is taught in all schools. Language schools can be found in all larger Thai cities, including Bangkok and Phuket.<br /> Most Thai youths learn English in school, so many young people have a basic grasp of English, though few are fluent. Most &#8220;front desk&#8221; people in the travel industry speak at least enough English to communicate, and many are relatively fluent; some also speak one or more other languages popular with their clientele, such as Chinese, Japanese, German, etc.<br /> Many Thais have trouble pronouncing the consonant clusters of the English language. Common confusion comes from the fact that Thais often pronounce &#8220;twenty&#8221; as &#8220;TEH-wen-ty&#8221;, making it sound like they&#8217;re saying &#8220;seventy&#8221;. Therefore it is a good idea to make use of the calculators that street  vendors may offer you to avoid confusion about prices offered when buying goods.<br /> [edit][add listing]Buy</p><p><strong>Weighty bahts</strong><br /> Is your new girlfriend asking for a one-baht gold ring? Watch out, as this isn&#8217;t the cheap trinket it sounds like: for jewellers and goldsmiths, the baht is also a measure of weight, or 15.244 grams (around 0.5 oz) to be exact. At 2009 gold prices, one baht of gold would thus cost you well north of 16,000 baht in cash!<br /> The currency of Thailand is the baht (THB, ฿), written in Thai as บาท or บ. There are six coins and six notes: 1, 5 (silver colour), and 10 baht (silver/gold) coins. 20 (green), 50 (blue), 100 (red), 500 (purple) and 1000 (grey-brown) baht notes<br /> The most useful bills tend to be 20s and 100s. Taxi drivers also like to pull the &#8220;no change&#8221; trick; if caught, hop into the nearest convenience store and make a small purchase. Beware of 1000-baht notes, as counterfeits are not uncommon: feel the embossing, look for the watermark and tilt to see color-changing ink to make sure the note is real.<br /> ATMs can be found in all cities and large towns, and international withdrawals are not a problem. When using a debit card, an ATM will typically provide a much better exchange rate than a money exchange counters, and this is especially the case if you have a card that does not charge a transaction fee for overseas withdrawals (becoming common in countries such as Australia). Since early 2009, there is a 150 baht surcharge for use of foreign ATM cards on virtually all banks&#8217; ATMs. Yellow Ayudhya (Krungsri) ATM&#8217;s should be avoided. Not only do they charge 150 THB surcharge, the exchange rate is horrible.<br /> One notable money exchanger is SuperRich [20], with branches in Bangkok at Silom, Ratchadamri, Khao San Road and Chatuchak. No fees are charged and the exchange rate is typically better than at ATMs (even before you consider ATM and your local bank fees), with a very small buy/sell spread.<br /> More remote areas (including smaller islands) don&#8217;t have banks or ATMs, so cash or traveller&#8217;s checks are essential. Many hotels and guest houses will change money for guests, but hefty commissions and poor rates may apply. US dollars in small bills (1s, 5s, and 20s) are invaluable for onward travel to neighbouring countries other than Malaysia, but are only useful in Thailand for exceptional purchases (eg paying visa fees for Cambodia).<br /> Credit cards are widely accepted in the tourist industry, at restaurants, shopping malls and shops catering to tourists. Fraud is regrettably common though, so use them sparingly and tell your bank in advance, so your card doesn&#8217;t get locked down because you are using it. Some businesses add a surcharge (usually 2-3%) if you&#8217;re paying by credit card; in this case, it can turn out cheaper to pay them in cash.</p><p><strong>Costs</strong>. Thailand is not as cheap as it used to be with Bangkok recently being named the second most expensive city in south east Asia behind Singapore. However, budget travelers who are careful with what they spend will still find 1,000 baht will get a backpacker a dorm bed or cheap room, three square meals a day and leave enough for transport, sightseeing, and even partying. Doubling that budget will let you stay in decent 3-star hotels, and if you&#8217;re willing to fork out 5000 baht per day or more you can live like a king. Bangkok requires a more generous budget than upcountry destinations, but also offers by far the most competitive prices for shoppers who shop around. The most popular tourism islands such as Phuket and Ko Samui tend to have higher prices in general. It is common for tourists to be charged several times the actual price in tourist areas of other places, as well. If you do want to have an idea what the real Thai prices are &#8211; consider visiting malls like Big C, Tesco or Carrefour where locals and expats do routinely shop. Those are available in any major cities (in Bangkok, there are dozens of them) and even on some larger islands such as Phuket or Ko Samui.</p><p><strong>Shopping</strong>. Thailand is a shopper&#8217;s paradise and many visitors to Bangkok in particular end up spending much of their time in the countless markets and malls. Particularly good buys are clothing, both cheap locally produced streetwear and fancy Thai silk, and all sorts of handicrafts. Electronics and computer gear are also widely available, but prices are slightly higher than in Singapore, Hong Kong, Philippines and Kuala Lumpur.<br /> A Thai speciality are the night markets found in almost every town, the largest and best-known of which are in Bangkok and the Night Bazaar in Chiang Mai. Here a variety of vendors from designers to handicraft sellers have stalls selling goods which cannot normally be found in malls and day markets. Most night markets also have large open air food courts attached.<br /> You can also find marvelously tacky modern clothing accessories. Witness pink sandals with clear plastic platform heels filled with fake flowers. Night markets along the main roads and Bangkok&#8217;s Mahboonkrong (MBK) Mall, near the Siam skytrain stop, are particularly good sources. Not to be left out is what is often touted as the world&#8217;s biggest weekend bazaar &#8211; The Chatuchak Weekend Market or knowned to locals simply as &#8220;JJ&#8221; Market. Chatuchak sells a myriad of products ranging from clothes to antiques, covers over 35 acres (1.1 km square) and is growing by the day!<br /> Haggling is the norm and often market and road-side vendors will try to charge you as much as they think you can afford to pay. It&#8217;s not uncommon to buy something, walk outside, and find somebody who bought the same item for half or one third what you paid (or even less). Try to figure out the item&#8217;s rough value first — adjacent stalls, government-run fixed price shops and even hotel gift shops are a good starting point — and you&#8217;ll find that prices drop drastically when the seller realizes you have some idea of what it costs.</p><p><strong>Work</strong>. The two main opportunities for work for foreigners are teaching English and dive instructor, but both are very competitive and dive masters in particular are paid a pittance.<br /> To become a dive instructor, the most popular destination is Ko Tao (Turtle Island) a few hours off the coast of Chumphon in the Gulf of Thailand. There are dozens of dive shops that provide training and internships.<br /> Anyone with a four-year degree can gain employment as an English teacher in Thailand, and even those without a degree can usually find work under the table. Normal starting salary is approximately 30,000 baht per month and this goes up and down slightly depending upon location (higher in Bangkok, lower in some up-country towns).<br /> Finding any other kind of work in Thailand can be difficult, as wages are poor and a large number of occupations are legally off limits to non-Thais. Thai law requires foreigner to earn quite a high wage to be eligible for a work permit. Companies and schools should assist employees to obtain visas and work permits, but some schools fear the extra work involved.<br /> Volunteering is a great way to meet locals and experience the culture and traditions of Thailand. There are many worldwide organizations that offer volunteer work on such projects as community development, conservation, wildlife sanctuary maintenance &#038; development, scientific research, &#038; education programs.</p><p><strong>Eat</strong><br /> The food alone is really reason enough for a trip to Thailand. Curries, fruit shakes, stir fries, fresh fish made a zillion ways &#8211; and that&#8217;s just the beginning. Food in Thailand can be as cheap and easy as 25 baht pad thai (Thai fried noodles) cooked at a street stall or as expensive and complicated as a $100 ten-course meal by a royal chef served in one of Bangkok&#8217;s 5 star hotels.<br /> Since most backpackers will be sticking closer to the first than the second, one of the great things about Thailand is that food from stalls and tiny sidewalk restaurants is usually quite safe. Unlike some Asian countries, travellers should worry more about overeating or too much curry spice than about unclean kitchens and bad food. In fact, street restaurants, where you can see what you&#8217;ll get and everything is cooked on the spot can be a safe option.<br /> Etiquette. Thai food is most commonly eaten with fork and spoon. Hold the spoon in your right hand and use it to eat, and reserve the fork for piling food onto your spoon. Chopsticks are only employed for noodle soups and East Asian-style dishes.<br /> Thai cuisine. Thai cuisine is characterized by balance and strong flavors, especially lime juice, lemon grass and fresh coriander, the combination of which gives Thai food its distinctive taste. In addition, Thai food has a deserved reputation for being spicy.<br /> Drink. Tap water is usually not drinkable in Thailand outside of Bangkok. In many places in Bangkok however, particularly in new buildings, drinking tap water is perfectly safe. However, if you don&#8217;t want to chance it, buying a bottle of water is the obvious solution. Ice in Thailand usually comes packaged straight from the factory and is safe; there is only reason to worry if you are served hand-cut ice.  Mainly in residential areas, machines dispensing water into your own bottle (1 baht/liter, or 50 satang (0.5 baht/liter) if paying more than 5 baht) are often available. This is a clean (the water is cleaned and UV-treated on the spot) and extremely cheap option, also, this way you&#8217;ll avoid making unnecessary plastic waste from empty bottles.<br /> Energy drinks. Thailand is the original home of the Red Bull brand energy drink. The Thai version, however, is syrupy sweet, uncarbonated and comes packaged in medicinal-looking brown glass bottles. Alcohol. Drinking alcohol in Thailand, especially if you like Western tipples, is actually comparatively expensive &#8211; but still very affordable by Western standards.<br /> Whisky. The misnamed Thai whisky (lao) refers to a number of liquors. The best known are the infamous Mae Khong brand and its competitor, the sweeter Saeng Som (&#8220;Sangsom&#8221;), which are both brewed primarily from sugarcane and thus technically rum. Indeed, the only resemblances to whisky are the brown color and high alcohol content, and indeed many people liken the smell to nail polish remover, but the taste is not quite as bad, especially when diluted with cola or tonic water. This is also by far the cheapest way to get blotto. The &#8220;real&#8221; Thai whisky is lao khao, which is distilled from rice. While commercial versions are available, it&#8217;s mostly distilled at home as moonshine, in which case it also goes by the name lao theuan (&#8220;jungle liquor&#8221;). White liquor with herbs added for flavor and medical effect is called ya dong. Strictly speaking, both are is illegal, but nobody seems to mind very much — especially when hilltribe trekking in the North you&#8217;re likely to be invited to sample some, and it&#8217;s polite to at least take a sip.<br /> Beer. Western-style beer is a bit of an upmarket drink in Thailand, with the price of a small bottle hovering between 50 and 100 baht in most pubs, bars and restaurants. Thais like their lagers with relatively high alcohol content (around 6%), as it is designed to be drunk with ice, so the beer in Thailand may pack more of a punch than you are used to.</p><p><strong>Sleep</strong>.<br /> Thailand has a plethora of accommodation in every price bracket. Always take a look at the room (or better still several rooms, sometimes owners offer not the best/cheaper rooms first) before agreeing a price. In smaller establishments also do ask for the agreed price in writing to avoid problems during check out. Guesthouses are usually the cheapest option. Hostelworld.com is the best way to book, as it is reliable and the reviews are very helpful to best suit  your tastes.</p><p><strong>Stay safe</strong><br /> The number one cause of death for visitors to Thailand is motorbike accidents, especially on the often narrow, mountainous and twisty roads of Phuket and Samui. Drive defensively, wear a helmet, don&#8217;t drink and avoid travel at night.<br /> Scams<br /> Thailand has more than its fair share of scams, but most are easily avoided with some common sense.<br /> More a nuisance than a danger, a common scam by touts, taxi drivers and tuk-tuk drivers in Thailand is to wait by important monuments and temples and waylay Western travellers, telling them that the site is closed for a &#8220;Buddhist holiday&#8221;, &#8220;repairs&#8221; or a similar reason. The &#8216;helpful&#8217; driver will then offer to take the traveller to another site, such as a market or store. Travellers who accept these offers will often end up at out-of-the-way markets with outrageous prices &#8211; and no way to get back to the center of town where they came from.<br /> Many visitors will encounter young Thai ladies armed with a clipboard and a smile enquiring as to their nationality, often with an aside along the lines of &#8220;please help me to earn 30 baht&#8221;. The suggestion is that the visitor completes a tourism questionnaire (which includes supplying their hotel name and room number) with the incentive that they just might win a prize &#8211; the reality is that everyone gets a call to say that they are a &#8220;winner&#8221;; however, the prize can only be collected by attending an arduous time-share presentation. Note that the lady with the clipboard doesn&#8217;t get her 30 baht if you don&#8217;t attend the presentation; also that only English-speaking nationalities are targeted.<br /> Robbery on buses. Theft is common enough in Thailand &#8211; and buses are a favourite venue. In one famous case, the owner of Noporat Tours in Phuket was caught rifling minibus passengers&#8217; bags during a rest stop. People are also drugged and robbed on overnight buses. Steer clear of cheapish and non-government buses, and keep your money in a money belt or another hard-to-reach place. Decline offers of food and especially drink. Warning your travel companions about these dangers will be useful. If robbed, refuse to get off the bus, loudly tell the other passengers what has happened, and ask the driver to call the police.<br /> Prostitution. Thailand&#8217;s age of consent is 15 but a higher minimum age of 18 applies in the case of prostitutes. Thai penalties for sex with minors are harsh, and even if  your partner is over the age of consent in Thailand, tourists who have sex with minors may be prosecuted by their home country. As far as ascertaining the age of your partner goes, all adult Thais must carry an identity card, which will state that they were born in 2537 or earlier if they were over the age of 18 on January 1, 2012 (in the Thai calendar, 2012 [Gregorian calendar] is the year 2555).<br /> Some prostitutes are &#8220;freelancers&#8221;, but most are employed by bars or similar businesses and if hiring a prostitute from a bar or similar business, you will have to pay a fee for the establishment called a &#8220;bar fine&#8221;. This entitles you to take them out of their place of employment; it does not pay for any bedroom gymnastics.<br /> Bar girls, gogo girls and freelancers are all professionals, who are far more likely to be interested in money you can give them than in a relationship for its own sake. Cases of visitors falling desperately in love, then being milked of most or all they are worth, would by now number in the tens of thousands. Bargirls are usually very sweet, and have dazzling smiles &#8211; which in the West would connote innocence, or at least trustworthiness. Not so here. There are endless stories of girls receiving money from multiple foreign boyfriends (and chatting to up to 4 of these &#8216;donors&#8217; simultaneously at Internet shops). Building a house for a girlfriend&#8217;s family is frequently followed by the girl ending the relationship (but keeping the house). There are many trustworthy Thai women, but very few of them have ever worked in bars.<br /> Thailand has a high rate of sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV/AIDS, both among the general population and among prostitutes. Condoms can be bought easily in Thailand in all convenience shops and pharmacies but may not be as safe as Western ones.<br /> Drugs. Thailand has extremely strict drug laws and your foreign passport is not enough to get you out of legal hot water. Possession and trafficking offenses that would merit traffic-ticket misdemeanors in other countries can result in life imprisonment or even death in Thailand. Police frequently raid nightclubs, particularly in Bangkok, with urine tests and full body searches on all patrons. Ko Pha Ngan&#8217;s notoriously drug-fueled Full Moon Parties also often draw police attention.<br /> Possession of cannabis, while illegal, is treated less harshly and, if busted, you may be able to pay an &#8220;on the spot fine&#8221; to get out, although even this can set you back tens of thousands of baht. It&#8217;s highly unwise to rely on this. While some police will accept payments on the spot for violating drug laws, others will strictly follow the harsh drug laws to the letter.<br /> Penalties for drug possession in Thailand vary in harshness depending on the following: category of drug, amount of drug, and intent of the possessor. If you do take the risk and get arrested on drug-related charges, you would do well to immediately contact your embassy as a first step. The embassy usually cannot get you out of jail but can alert your home country of your arrest and can often put you in contact with a lawyer in Thailand. The availability of drugs in Thailand can mislead tourists into making light of the penalties for possessing or selling drugs, but that is unwise.<br /> Security. Carrying your own padlock is a good idea, as budget rooms sometimes use them instead of (or as well as) normal door locks; carry a spare key someplace safe, like your money belt, otherwise considerable expense as well as inconvenience may result should you lose the original. Also consider some type of cable to lock your bag to something too big to fit through the door or window.<br /> Wildlife. Thailand has a few dangerous animals. The most common menace is stray dogs which frequent even the streets of Bangkok. The vast majority of which are passive and harmless, but a few of which may carry rabies, so steer clear of them and do not, by any means, feed or pet them. If they try to attack you, don&#8217;t run as this will encourage them to chase you as if you were prey. Instead, try to walk away slowly.<br /> Monkeys may be cute and friendly, but in any area where unaware tourists have corrupted them, they expect to get food from humans. They can be very sneaky thieves, and they can bite. As with dogs, you won&#8217;t want to get bitten, whether or not they have rabies.<br /> Poisonous cobras can be found throughout Thailand, hiding in tall brush or along streams. You&#8217;re unlikely to ever see one, as they shy away from humans, but they may bite if surprised or provoked. The Siamese crocodile, on the other hand, is nearly extinct and found only in a few remote national parks. Monitor lizards are common in jungles, but despite their scary reptilian appearance they&#8217;re harmless.<br /> Box Jellyfish have killed ocean swimmers, tourists and locals alike, many survive. All jellyfish stings are extremely painful. Immediate treatment is for cardiac arrest (CPR). 30 seconds of vinegar will keep tentacles from continuing to sting. Vinegar prevents making the contact worse when you wipe the tentacles off with a cloth. At the hospital they might give you antivenom and painkillers. The word is getting out and some resorts have nets around the swimming areas.<br /> Racial issues<br /> Thais are normally very tolerant of people and tourists, regardless of skin colour, are very unlikely to encounter aggressive racial abuse. Thais, who are often a bit weary of the younger Caucasian backpackers who treat the country as nothing but a big drinking holiday.<br /> Fights. Do not get into fights with Thais. Foreigners will eventually be outnumbered 15 to 1 (even against Thai people not initially involved) and weapons (metals, sharp objects, beer bottles, martial arts) are usually involved. Trying to break up someone else&#8217;s fight is as bad of an idea, and your intention to help may get you hurt.<br /> Medical Tourism. A growing trend in Southeast Asia is that of foreigners seeking more affordable medical procedures. From hip replacements to dental care, Thailand has become a country of choice for residents of the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States. Other countries contributing to the doubling of medical tourism to Thailand between 2008-2012 include the Middle East (UAE, Kuwait, and Oman), Germany, Japan, and Thailand’s fellow ASEAN countries.<br /> Many factors contribute to Thailand’s attractiveness as a medical tourism destination, not least of which is its well-developed infrastructure.. Add to that its many excellent medical and dental facilities, including 30 JCI accredited hospitals; its excellent medical establishment with many Western-trained and certified doctors; and the substantial price savings available, and one can well see why so many medical tourists are heading towards Thailand.<br /> Medical Treatments. Thailand has a popular reputation as a cosmetic and sexual reassignment surgery destination.</p><p><strong>Stay healthy</strong><br /> Being a tropical country, Thailand has its fair share of exotic tropical diseases. Malaria is generally not a problem in any of the major tourist destinations, but is endemic in rural areas along the borders with Cambodia (including Ko Chang in Trat Province), Laos and Myanmar. As is the case throughout South-East Asia, dengue fever can be encountered just about anywhere, including the most modern cities. The only prevention is avoiding mosquito bites; wear long pants and long sleeves at dusk in mosquito areas and use repellent.<br /> Food hygiene levels in Thailand are reasonably high, and it&#8217;s generally safe to eat at street markets and to drink any water offered to you in restaurants. Using common sense — eg. avoiding the vendor who leaves raw meat sitting in the sun with flies buzzing around — and following the precautions listed in our article on travellers&#8217; diarrhea is still advisable.<br /> HIV/AIDS (Estimated adult (15-49) HIV prevalence is 1.3% in 2007) and other sexually transmitted diseases are common, especially among sex workers. Condoms are sold in all convenience stores, supermarkets, pharmacies, etc. Avoid injection drug use.<br /> There&#8217;s a pharmacy on every block in Thailand and most are happy to sell you anything you want without a prescription. However, this is technically illegal, and police have been known to occasionally bust tourists for possessing medicines without a prescription — even innocuous stuff like asthma meds.</p><p><strong>Respect</strong>.<br /> Thais are a polite people and, while remarkably tolerant of foreigners gallivanting on their beaches and with their women, you&#8217;ll find that you will get more respect if you in turn treat them and their customs with respect.<br /> The wai. The traditional greeting known as the wai, where you press your hands together as is in prayer and bow slightly, is derived from the Hindu cultural influence from India, and still widely practised. Among Thais, there are strict rules of hierarchy that dictate how and when the wai should be given. In brief, inferiors salute superiors first. You should not wai service people or street vendors. The higher your hands go, the more respectful you are. You will also often see Thais doing a wai as they walk past temples and spirit houses. As a foreign visitor, you are not expected to know how to wai, nor to reciprocate when wai&#8217;d to; while you&#8217;re unlikely to cause offense if you do, you may well look slightly strange. If somebody makes a wai to you, a slight bow alone is more than sufficient for ordinary occasions, and for business, most Thais will shake hands with foreigners instead of waiing anyway.<br /> Dress. Personal appearance is very important in Thailand as a measure of respect to other people, you will find that dressing appropriately means that you are shown more respect in return. This translates in many ways, even sometimes lowering initial offering prices at markets. While some allowance is made for the differing customs of foreigners, Thais respond more positively to well-dressed Westerners.<br /> Taking off one&#8217;s shoes at temples and private homes is mandatory etiquette, and this may even be requested at some shops. Wear shoes that slip on and off easily. Flip-flops, hiking sandals, and clog-type shoes are usually a good pragmatic choice for traveling in Thailand; only in the most top-end establishments are shoes required.<br /> It is best to play it safe with wats and other sacred sites in Thailand; your dress should be unambiguously modest and cover your entire torso and most of your limbs. For men, ankle-length pants are mandatory; on top, t-shirts are acceptable. Many recommend that women wear only full length dresses and skirts; you should make sure that your clothing covers at least your shoulders and your knees and some places may require that you wear ankle-length pants or skirts and long sleeved tops. Shorts and sleeveless shirts are highly inappropriate, as are short skirts.<br /> Monks. Buddhist monks are meant to avoid the temptation of women, and in particular they do not touch women or take things from women&#8217;s hands. Women should make every effort to make way for monks on the street and give them room so they do not have to make contact with you. Women should avoid offering anything to a monk with their hands. Objects or donations should be placed in front of a monk so he can pick it up, or place it on a special cloth he carries with him. While some monks do accept money, most of them do not and offering money to a monk is sometimes considered a sign of disrespect in Theravada Buddhist cultures. Therefore, should you wish to donate to a monk, you should only offer food and put your donation in the appropriate donation box at the temple.<br /> In the morning from 5:00 to 6:30, monks are seen walking to the front of our houses and the main road. At the same time, you can give alms to Buddhist monks. The most popular item that most people offer is rice. While the monks stand in front of you, you put something you had prepared into the monk&#8217;s alms-bowl.<br /> The Royal Family. It&#8217;s illegal to show disrespect to royalty, a crime which carries up to 15 years imprisonment. Do not make any negative remarks, or any remarks which might be perceived as disrespectful about the King or any members of the Royal Family.<br /> Animal Abuse. Elephants are a large part of Thailand&#8217;s tourist business, and the smuggling and mistreatment of elephants for tourist attractions is a widespread practice. Be aware that elephants are often separated from their mothers at a young age to be cruelly trained under captivity for the rest of their lives. If you intend to go on an elephant ride, purchase an elephant painting or &#8220;use&#8221; elephants for other activities please take their mistreatment into account. There are a few ethical animal tourism operators in Thailand such as Elephant Nature Park and Maetang Elephant Park in Chiang Mai.<br /> Other<br /> The head is considered the holiest part of the body, and the foot the dirtiest part. Never touch or pat a Thai on the head, including children. If  you accidentally touch or bump someone&#8217;s head, apologize immediately or you&#8217;ll be perceived as very rude. Similarly, do not touch people with your feet, or even point with them. If someone is sitting with outstretched feet, avoid stepping over them, as this is very rude and could even spark a confrontation. Squeeze around them or ask them to move. Even if the person is sleeping, it is best to go around, as others are likely to notice. Take care when you sit in a temple to cross your legs under you &#8220;mermaid-style&#8221; so your feet do not point at any person or statue. Do not pose alongside a Buddhist statue for a photo and certainly don&#8217;t clamber on them. It&#8217;s OK to take photos of a statue, but everyone should be facing it.  Also, as doorway thresholds are considered a sanctuary for spirits, it&#8217;s important not to step on a raised threshold, but rather to step over it. Keep this in mind especially when visiting temples.<br /> In Thailand, expression of negative emotions such as anger or sadness is almost never overt, and it is possible to enjoy a vacation in Thailand without ever seeming to see an argument or an unhappy person. Thai people smile constantly, and to outsiders this is seen as happiness or friendliness. In reality, smiling is a very subtle way to communicate, and to those who live in Thailand, a smile can indicate any emotion from fear, to anger, to sadness, to joy, etc. &#8220;Saving face&#8221; is a very important aspect of Thai culture and they will try to avoid embarrassment and confrontation.<br /> In public places (such as large markets) the National Anthem is played over loudspeakers at 8 A.M. and 6 P.M. When this is played, everybody stops what they are doing and stands still, and you should do the same. The Royal Anthem is played in cinemas before the film, and everyone must stand. It lasts about a minute, then everyone will continue where they left off. In  MRT and SkyTrain stations in Bangkok, the escalators will also lurch to a halt to prevent a large human pile-up.</p><p><strong>Cope</strong>.<br /> Bring an open mind and a sense of humour. Don&#8217;t come with too many preconceived ideas about what Thailand is like, as media and friends’ experiences have a habit of distorting reality.<br /> If you&#8217;re sticking to major cities and tourist areas, don&#8217;t worry too much about under-packing; you can get hold of any essentials you&#8217;ve forgotten. Essentials are a swimming costume, a day pack, an umbrella in rainy season and some warm clothes if traveling in October to December, as some areas get cool. Some sources say there is no point in bringing a raincoat during the warm rainy season because it is so hot and sticky your raincoat will be uncomfortable. You will only need a couple of changes of clothes as you can get washing done anywhere cheaply. Sandals for when your hiking shoes are too hot can be bought cheaply in Thailand, although large sizes for women are harder to come by. If female and anything above a size 2, busty, or tall, it is often difficult to find clothes that will fit you in any of the Thai shops. If you are male and have a waist more than 38&#8243; you will have trouble finding pants. You will largely be limited to backpacker gear (the omnipresent fisherman pants and &#8220;Same Same&#8221; t-shirts) or Western imports in Bangkok malls, for the same prices as back home or more. While laundry is cheap, it is useful to bring a few changes of clothes, as you may sweat your way through several outfits a day in the Thai weather.<br /> Take enough padlocks for every double zipper to stop wandering hands and lock up your belongings, even in your hotel room. Lock zippers through the lower holes, not the upper ones on the pull tabs — although even this precaution won&#8217;t help much if you encounter a razor-blade artist.<br /> Take snorkeling gear or buy it on arrival if you plan to spend a lot of your time in the water. A compass is handy at any time to get  your bearings.. You might like to bring compact binoculars too if wildlife is your thing. A good map of Thailand is also handy.<br /> Take earplugs for when you&#8217;re stuck in a noisy room or want to sleep on the bus. Take a mirror for shaving, as often budget places won’t have any. String is very handy for hanging up washing. Cigarette papers can be difficult to find, except in tourist centres. If you have prescription glasses, it is a good idea to bring a spare pair of glasses or contact lenses plus a copy of your prescription.<br /> Into the toiletries bag throw sun screen and insect repellent. Mosquito coils are also a good idea. A small pocket size torch / flashlight will come in handy when the electricity goes out or for investigating caves. Passport photos come in handy for visas.<br /> Aside from the above, the following are recommended:<br /> Prescriptions for any prescription medications being brought through customs. Travel insurance. Blood donor/type card. Details of your next of kin. A second photo ID other than your passport. Credit card plus a backup card for a separate account.</p><p><strong>Contact</strong>.<br /> Connectivity in Thailand is generally quite good.<br /> Telephone. To place an international call, you can buy a prepaid card (available for 300 baht at many convenience stores and guesthouses) to use with one of the bright yellow Lenso payphones. You should rarely have trouble finding either of these unless you&#8217;re way out in the countryside. The international access code is 001.<br /> For mobile phone users, Thailand has three GSM mobile service providers &#8211; AIS [44], DTAC [45] and Truemove [46]) &#8211; which may be useful if you have (or can afford!) a mobile phone that will work on either one or both of the GSM 900 or 1800 frequency bands (consult your phone&#8217;s technical specifications). If you have one, you can buy a prepaid SIM card for any of the Thai carriers in any convenience store for as little as 50-200 baht and charge it up as you go. You can buy a Thai SIM online before you come or the Bangkok airport is a good place to buy a SIM card. All 3 carriers have shops there with and will help you get set up. Moreover, at major airports like Chiang Mai and Phuket, you may be greeted by a service provider giving SIM cards away for free. Look for offers in the baggage claim area..All phones sold in Thailand are &#8220;unlocked&#8221;. Which means you can use it with any SIM card. To use a Thai SIM, be sure your phone is unlocked.<br /> International rates from a Thai carriers are good, but all carriers now offer discount prefixes, like 009 for CAT telecom. A standard DTAC call, for example, charges 10 baht/minute to call the USA. With the 004 prefix, the cost is 3 baht/minute. By predialing 009 1(xxx)xxx-xxxx for the USA will give you 5 baht/minute rate, at the expense of slight voice quality decrease (which is often unnoticeable).<br /> TrueMove H offers very good international call rates from 1 baht per minute to destinations including the USA, Canada, Australia, UK, France and Germany with its Inter SIM promotion. You may find the SIM cards handed out for free at some airports, branded as an AOT SIM and including 5 minutes of free calls back home. Note that you should also use prefixes (006 for better quality, 00600 for cheaper rate, however, for some countries, the rate is same for both promotions) to get those cheap rates, but this, as well as rates for selected countries, is clearly listed on SIM card packages.<br /> Coverage is very good throughout the country, all cities and tourist destinations (including resort islands) are well covered, and even in the countryside it&#8217;s more likely you&#8217;ll get the network signal than not, especially with AIS or DTAC SIM. True Move H coverage is considered the worst, with phones occasionally losing signal even in towns. Nevertheless, if you plan to stay only in major cities/islands, and/or don&#8217;t need you phone available all the time when outside of those &#8211; True SIM is OK too. As of Oct 2013, all networks have 3G on 2100 MHz and have comparable speeds.<br /> If you plan to visit Thailand at least once a year for short periods, consider buying the SIM with minimal validity restrictions (usually one year from the last top up, even if it was 10 baht). By doing this, you can re-use the SIM on subsequent trips, thus avoiding hassle of buying a new one every time, keeping your Thai number the same, as well as saving a bit. For example,<br /> Smart Phones / Tablets / Aircards. A smart phone is an incredibly useful thing to have while traveling. All three GSM operators offer nationwide GPRS/EDGE and 3G service in all major desitinations. Usually this service is already pre-activated on the prepaid SIM. Internet usage is billed by the minute, if there is no data package chosen.<br /> Internet. Internet cafés are widespread and most are inexpensive. Prices as low as 15 baht/hour are commonplace, and speed of connection is generally reasonable. If you suddenly and unexpectedly find yourself typing in Thai (or any other alien script) you&#8217;ve probably accidentally hit whatever key-combination the computer you&#8217;re using has been configured to use for switching between languages.. To change back, use the &#8220;Text Services and Input Languages&#8221; option (a quick-access menu is usually available via a &#8220;TH&#8221; icon visible on the taskbar &#8211; simply switch it to &#8220;EN&#8221;).</p><div class="printfriendly pf-button pf-button-content pf-alignleft"> <a href="index.html#" rel="nofollow" onclick="window.print(); return false;" title="Printer Friendly, PDF & Email"> <noscript><img decoding="async" class="pf-button-img" src="https://cdn.printfriendly.com/buttons/printfriendly-pdf-email-button-md.png" alt="Print Friendly, PDF & Email" style="width: 194px;height: 30px;"  /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload pf-button-img" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://cdn.printfriendly.com/buttons/printfriendly-pdf-email-button-md.png" alt="Print Friendly, PDF & Email" style="width: 194px;height: 30px;"  /> </a></div></div></div><div id="entry-author-info"><div id="author-avatar"></div><div id="author-description"><h2> About admin</h2> I would like to think of myself as a full time traveler. I have been retired since 2006 and in that time have traveled every winter for four to seven months. The months that I am "home", are often also spent on the road, hiking or kayaking. 
I hope to present a website that describes my travel along with my hiking and sea kayaking experiences.<div id="author-link"> <a href="../../../../author/admin/index.html" rel="author"> View all posts by admin <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span> </a></div></div></div><div class="entry-utility"> This entry was posted in <a href="../../../../category/uncategorized/index.html" rel="category tag">Uncategorized</a>.
