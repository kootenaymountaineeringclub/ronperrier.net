If you adore quietude, take a trip to São Tomé &amp; Príncipe, Africa’s second-smallest country. These two tiny volcanic bumps anchored off the Gabonese coast easily win the hearts of foreigners with their Portuguese-Creole flavour and relaxed vibes, and it won’t take too long before you’re infected with the pervasive leve leve (which loosely means ‘take it easy’) mood.<br /> The sublime laid-back tempo is enhanced by a wealth of natural attractions: miles of perfect palm-fringed beaches, huge swaths of emerald rain forest, soaring volcanic peaks and mellow fishing villages. The birdlife is excellent, and endemic plants (especially orchids) are plentiful. In season, turtle- and whale-watching opportunities abound.<br /> This two-island nation has its cultural gems as well, with a surprising number of heritage buildings dating back to the colonial era, including impressive roças (plantation estates). Tourism is still low-key and is being developed in a carefully controlled, ecologically minded way. There are no tacky resorts, just a number of locally run, enticing, nature-oriented lodges and hotels.</p><p><strong>Capital</strong> and largest city São Tomé 0°20′N 6°44′E<br /> <strong>Languages.</strong> Official: Portuguese.

It consists of two archipelagos around the two main islands: São Tomé and Príncipe, located about 140 kilometres (87 miles) apart and about 250 and 225 kilometres (155 and 140 miles), respectively, off the northwestern coast of Gabon.</p><p>The islands were uninhabited until their discovery by Portuguese explorers in the 15th century. Gradually colonized and settled by Portugal throughout the 16th century, they collectively served as a vital commercial and trade center for the Atlantic slave trade. The rich volcanic soil and close proximity to the equator made São Tomé and Príncipe ideal for sugar cultivation, followed later by cash crops such as coffee and cocoa; the lucrative plantation economy was heavily dependent upon imported African slaves. Cycles of social unrest and economic instability throughout the 19th and 20th centuries culminated in peaceful independence in 1975. São Tomé and Príncipe has since remained one of Africa&#8217;s most stable and democratic countries.<br /> With a population of 192,993 (2013 Census), São Tomé and Príncipe is the second-smallest African country after Seychelles, as well as the smallest Portuguese-speaking country. Its people are predominantly of African and mestiço descent, with most adhering to Roman Catholicism. The legacy of Portuguese rule is also visible in the country&#8217;s culture, customs, and music, which fuse European and African influences.</p><p><strong>HISTORY</strong><br /> The islands of São Tomé and Príncipe were uninhabited when the Portuguese arrived sometime around 1470. They were considered good locations for bases to trade with the mainland.  Ilha do Príncipe (&#8220;Prince&#8217;s Island&#8221;) refers to the Prince of Portugal to whom duties on the island&#8217;s sugar crop were paid.</p><p>The first successful settlement of São Tomé was established in 1493 and on Príncipe in 1500. Attracting settlers proved difficult and most of the earliest inhabitants were &#8220;undesirables&#8221; sent from Portugal, mostly Jews. In time these settlers found the volcanic soil of the region suitable for agriculture, especially the growing of sugar.<br /> By 1515, Sao Tome and Principe had become slave depots for the coastal slave trade centered at Elmina. The cultivation of sugar was a labor-intensive process and the Portuguese began to import large numbers of slaves from the mainland. By the mid-16th century the Portuguese settlers had turned the islands into Africa&#8217;s foremost exporter of sugar. São Tomé and Príncipe were taken over and administered by the Portuguese crown in 1522 and 1573, respectively.<br /> However, competition from sugar-producing colonies in the Western Hemisphere began to hurt the islands. The large slave population also proved difficult to control, with Portugal unable to invest many resources in the effort. Sugar cultivation thus declined over the next 100 years, and by the mid-17th century, the economy of São Tomé had changed. It was now primarily a transit point for ships engaged in the slave trade between the West and continental Africa.<br /> In the early 19th century, two new cash crops, coffee and cocoa, were introduced. The rich volcanic soils proved well suited to the new cash crop industry, and soon extensive plantations (known as &#8220;roças&#8221;), owned by Portuguese companies or absentee landlords, occupied almost all of the good farmland. By 1908, São Tomé had become the world&#8217;s largest producer of cocoa, which remains the country&#8217;s most important crop.<br /> The roças system, which gave the plantation managers a high degree of authority, led to abuses against the African farm workers. Although Portugal officially abolished slavery in 1876, the practice of forced paid labour continued. Scientific American magazine documented in words and pictures the continued use of slaves in São Tomé in its 13 March 1897 issue.<br /> In the early 20th century, an internationally publicized controversy arose over charges that Angolan contract workers were being subjected to forced labour and unsatisfactory working conditions. Sporadic labor unrest and dissatisfaction continued well into the 20th century, culminating in an outbreak of riots in 1953 in which several hundred African laborers were killed in a clash with their Portuguese rulers. This &#8220;Batepá Massacre&#8221; remains a major event in the colonial history of the islands, and its anniversary is officially observed by the government.<br /> <strong>Independence</strong> (1975). By the late 1950s, when other emerging nations across the African Continent were demanding independence, a small group of São Toméans had formed the Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe (MLSTP), which eventually established its base in nearby Gabon. Picking up momentum in the 1960s, events moved quickly after the overthrow of the Caetano dictatorship in Portugal in April 1974.<br /> The new Portuguese regime was committed to the dissolution of its overseas colonies. São Tomé and Príncipe achieved independence on 12 July 1975, choosing as the first president the MLSTP Secretary General Manuel Pinto da Costa.<br /> In 1990, São Tomé became one of the first African countries to undergo democratic reform, and changes to the constitution – the legalization of opposition political parties – led to elections in 1991 that were nonviolent, free, and transparent. Miguel Trovoada, a former prime minister who had been in exile since 1986, returned as an independent candidate and was elected president. Trovoada was re-elected in São Tomé&#8217;s second multi-party presidential election in 1996.<br /> The army seized power for one week in July 2003, complaining of corruption and that forthcoming oil revenues would not be divided fairly. An accord was negotiated under which President de Menezes was returned to office. The cohabitation period ended in March 2006.<br /> In the 2006 presidential election, Fradique de Menezes easily won a second five-year term. On 12 February 2009, there was an attempted coup d&#8217;état to overthrow President Fradique de Menezes. The coup plotters were imprisoned, but later received a pardon from President de Menezes.<br /> Political culture. There exists the freedom of speech and the freedom to form opposition political parties. São Tomé and Príncipe finished 11th out of the African countries measured by the Ibrahim Index of African Governance in 2010, a comprehensive reflection of the levels of governance in Africa.<br /> <strong>Foreign relations.</strong> Has embassies in Angola, Gabon, Portugal, Belgium, Taiwan, and the USA.</p><p><strong>GEOGRAPHY</strong><br /> The islands of São Tomé and Príncipe, situated in the equatorial Atlantic and Gulf of Guinea about 300 and 250 kilometres (190 and 160 mi), respectively, off the northwest coast of Gabon, constitute Africa&#8217;s second smallest country. Both are part of the Cameroon volcanic mountain line, which also includes the islands of Annobón to the southwest, Bioko to the northeast (both part of Equatorial Guinea), and Mount Cameroon on the coast of Gulf of Guinea.<br /> São Tomé is 50 km (30 mi) long and 30 km (20 mi) wide and the more mountainous of the two islands. Its peaks reach 2,024 m (6,640 ft) – Pico de São Tomé. Príncipe is about 30 km long and 6 km wide. Its peaks reach 948 m (3,110 ft) – Pico de Príncipe. Swift streams radiating down the mountains through lush forest and cropland to the sea cross both islands. The equator lies immediately south of São Tomé Island, passing through an islet Ilhéu das Rolas.<br /> The Pico Cão Grande (Great Dog Peak) is a landmark volcanic plug peak, located at 0°7′0″N 6°34′00″E in southern São Tomé. It rises over 300 m (1,000 ft) above the surrounding terrain and the summit is 663 m (2,175 ft) above sea level.<br /> Climate. At sea level, the climate is tropical—hot and humid with average yearly temperatures of about 27 °C (80.6 °F) and little daily variation. The temperature rarely rises beyond 32 °C. At the interior&#8217;s higher elevations, the average yearly temperature is 20 °C, and nights are generally cool. Annual rainfall varies from 5,000 mm (196.9 in) on the southwestern slopes to 1,000 mm (39.4 in) in the northern lowlands. The rainy season is from October to May.<br /> Wildlife. São Tomé and Príncipe does not have a large number of native mammals (although the São Tomé shrew and several bat species are endemic). The islands are home to a larger number of endemic birds and plants, including the world&#8217;s smallest ibis (the São Tomé ibis), the world&#8217;s largest sunbird (the giant sunbird), the rare São Tomé fiscal, and several giant species of Begonia. São Tomé and Principe is an important marine turtle nesting site, including the hawksbill turtles.</p><p><strong>ECONOMY</strong><br /> Since the 19th century, the economy of São Tomé and Príncipe has been based on plantation agriculture. At the time of independence, Portuguese-owned plantations occupied 90% of the cultivated area. After independence, control of these plantations passed to various state-owned agricultural enterprises. The main crop on São Tomé is cocoa, representing about 95% of agricultural exports. Other export crops include copra, palm kernels, and coffee.<br /> Domestic food-crop production is inadequate to meet local consumption, so the country imports most of its food. In 1997 it was estimated that approximately 90 percent of the country&#8217;s food needs are met through imports. Efforts have been made by the government in recent years to expand food production, and several projects have been undertaken, largely financed by foreign donors.<br /> Other than agriculture, the main economic activities are fishing and a small industrial sector engaged in processing local agricultural products and producing a few basic consumer goods. The scenic islands have potential for tourism, and the government is attempting to improve its rudimentary tourist industry infrastructure. The government sector accounts for about 11% of employment.<br /> Following independence, the country had a centrally directed economy with most means of production owned and controlled by the state. The original constitution guaranteed a mixed economy, with privately owned cooperatives combined with publicly owned property and means of production.<br /> In the 1980s and 1990s, the economy of São Tomé encountered major difficulties. Economic growth stagnated, and cocoa exports dropped in both value and volume, creating large balance-of-payments deficits. Efforts to redistribute plantation land resulted in decreased cocoa production. At the same time, the international price of cocoa slumped.<br /> In response to its economic downturn, the government undertook a series of far-reaching economic reforms. In 1987, the government implemented an International Monetary Fund (IMF) structural adjustment program, and invited greater private participation in management of the parastatals, as well as in the agricultural, commercial, banking, and tourism sectors. The focus of economic reform since the early 1990s has been widespread privatization, especially of the state-run agricultural and industrial sectors.<br /> The São Toméan Government has traditionally obtained foreign assistance from various donors, including the UN Development Programme, the World Bank, the European Union (EU), Portugal, Taiwan, and the African Development Bank. In April 2000, in association with the Banco Central de São Tomé e Príncipe, the IMF approved a poverty reduction and growth facility for São Tomé aimed at reducing inflation to 3% for 2001, raising ideal growth to 4%, and reducing the fiscal deficit.<br /> In late 2000, São Tomé qualified for significant debt reduction under the IMF–World Bank&#8217;s Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. The reduction is being reevaluated by the IMF, due to the attempted coup d&#8217;état in July 2003 and subsequent emergency spending. Following the truce, the IMF decided to send a mission to São Tomé to evaluate the macroeconomic state of the country. This evaluation is ongoing, reportedly pending oil legislation to determine how the government will manage incoming oil revenues which are still poorly defined, but in any case expected to change the economic situation dramatically.<br /> In parallel, some efforts have been made to incentivize private tourism initiatives, but their scope remains limited.<br /> Portugal remains one of São Tomé&#8217;s major trading partners, particularly as a source of imports. Food, manufactured articles, machinery, and transportation equipment are imported primarily from the EU.<br /> São Tomé and Príncipe was ranked the 174th safest investment destination in the world in the March 2011 Euromoney Country Risk rankings.<br /> <strong>Petroleum exploration</strong><br /> In 2001, São Tomé and Nigeria reached agreement on joint exploration for petroleum in waters claimed by the two countries of the Niger Delta geologic province. After a lengthy series of negotiations, in April 2003 the joint development zone (JDZ) was opened for bids by international oil firms. The JDZ was divided into nine blocks; the winning bids for block one, ChevronTexaco, ExxonMobil, and the Norwegian firm, Equity Energy, were announced in April 2004, with São Tomé to take in 40% of the $123 million bid, and Nigeria the other 60%. Bids on other blocks were still under consideration in October 2004. São Tomé has received more than $2 million from the bank to develop its petroleum sector.</p><p><strong>DEMOGRAPHICS</strong><br /> The total population is estimated at 163,784 by the government agency. According to estimate around 157,500 live on São Tomé and 6,000 on Príncipe.<br /> All are descended from people from different countries taken to the islands by the Portuguese from 1470 onwards. In the 1970s, there were two significant population movements—the exodus of most of the 4,000 Portuguese residents and the influx of several hundred São Tomé refugees from Angola.<br /> <strong>Ethnic groups.</strong><br /> Mestiços &#8211; mixed-blood, descendants of Portuguese colonists and African slaves brought to the islands during the early years of settlement from Benin, Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Angola (these people also are known as filhos da terra or &#8220;children of the land&#8221;).<br /> Angolares &#8211; reputedly descendants of Angolan slaves who survived a 1540 shipwreck and now earn their livelihood fishing.<br /> Forros, descendants of freed slaves when slavery was abolished.<br /> Serviçais &#8211; contract laborers from Angola, Mozambique, and Cape Verde, living temporarily on the islands.<br /> Tongas &#8211; children of serviçais born on the islands.<br /> Europeans primarily Portuguese.<br /> Asians, mostly Chinese minority, including Macanese people of mixed Portuguese and Chinese descent from Macau.<br /> <strong>Language.</strong> Portuguese is the official language of São Tomé and Príncipe, with about 98.4% speaking it in the country, a significant share of it as their native language, and it is spoken in the islands since the end of the 15th century. Restructured variants of Portuguese or Portuguese creoles are also spoken: Forro, a creole language (36.2%), Cape Verdean Creole (8.5%), Angolar (6.6%) and Principense (1%). French (6.8%) and English (4.9%) are foreign languages taught in schools.<br /> <strong>Religion.</strong> Almost all residents belong to the Roman Catholic 71.9%, Other Christian 10.2% &#8211; Evangelical Protestant, or Seventh-day Adventist churches, which in turn retain close ties with churches in Portugal. There is a small but growing Muslim population.<br /> <strong>Health.</strong><br /> There was a resurgence of malaria in the country in 2010, but the exact cause is unknown.<br /> Female life expectancy at birth was 65.1 years in between 2005 and 2010, and male life expectancy at 62.8 for the same time period. Healthy life expectancy at birth was at 64.7 years in 2011.<br /> A Cuban medical team of seven doctors, nurses and other health workers is working on the main island, with occasional visits to Principe.<br /> Government health expenditure per capita was at US$90.73 (current US$) in 2009.<br /> According to WHO, São Tomé and Príncipe is also home to the largest documented amount of iron-deficiency anemia amongst any country&#8217;s population.<br /> <strong>Education.</strong> Compulsory for four years. The educational system has a shortage of classrooms, insufficiently trained and underpaid teachers, inadequate textbooks and materials, high rates of repetition, poor educational planning and management, and a lack of community involvement in school management. Domestic financing of the school system is lacking, leaving the system highly dependent on foreign financing.<br /> Tertiary institutions are the National Lyceum (São Tomé and Príncipe) and the Public University of São Tomé and Príncipe.</p><p><strong>CULTURE</strong><br /> São Toméan culture is a mixture of African and Portuguese influences.<br /> <strong>Music.</strong> São Toméans are known for ússua and socopé rhythms, while Príncipe is home to the dêxa beat. Portuguese ballroom dancing may have played an integral part in the development of these rhythms and their associated dances. Tchiloli is a musical dance performance that tells a dramatic story. The danço-Congo is similarly a combination of music, dance and theatre.<br /> <strong>Cuisine.</strong> Staple foods include fish, seafood, beans, maize and cooked banana. Tropical fruits such as pineapple, avocado and bananas are a significant component of the cuisine. The use of hot spices is prominent in São Tomése cuisine. Coffee is utilized in various dishes as a spice or seasoning. Breakfast dishes are often reheated leftovers from the previous evening&#8217;s meal, and omelettes are popular.</p><p><strong>WIKITRAVEL</strong></p><p><b>São Tomé and Príncipe</b> is located in the Gulf of Guinea, straddling the Equator, west of Gabon. Discovered and claimed by Portugal in the late 15th century, the islands&#8217; sugar-based economy gave way to coffee and cocoa in the 19th century &#8212; all grown with plantation slave labor, a form of which lingered into the 20th century. Although independence was achieved in 1975, democratic reforms were not instituted until the late 1980s, and the first free elections were held in 1991.</p><p>This island&#8217;s economy has become increasingly dependent on cocoa since independence 34 years ago. However, cocoa production has substantially declined because of drought and mismanagement. The resulting shortage of cocoa for export has created a persistent balance-of-payments problem. São Tomé has to import all fuels, most manufactured goods, consumer goods, and a substantial amount of food. Over the years, it has been unable to service its foreign debt and has had to depend on concessional aid and debt rescheduling. São Tomé benefited from $200 million in debt relief in December 2000 under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) program. São Tomé&#8217;s success in implementing structural reforms has been rewarded by international donors, who have pledged increased assistance in 2001. Considerable potential exists for development of a tourist industry, and the government has taken steps to expand facilities in recent years. The government also has attempted to reduce price controls and subsidies. São Tomé is also optimistic that substantial petroleum discoveries are forthcoming in its territorial waters in the oil-rich waters of the Gulf of Guinea. Corruption scandals continue to weaken the economy.<br /> <span id="Climate" class="mw-headline"><strong>Climate.</strong> </span>At sea level, the climate is tropical—hot and humid with average yearly temperatures of about 27 °C (80.6 °F) and little daily variation. The temperature rarely rises beyond 32 °C (89.6 °F). At the interior&#8217;s higher altitudes, the average yearly temperature is 20 °C (68 °F), and nights are generally cool. Annual rainfall varies from 5,000 mm (196.85 in) on the southwestern slopes to 1,000 mm (39.37 in) in the northern lowlands. The rainy season runs from October to May.<br /> The equator lies immediately south of São Tomé Island, passing through an islet named Ilhéu das Rolas.</p><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="thumbimage" src="https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/c/ca/Sao_Tome_and_Principe_Regions_map.png/300px-Sao_Tome_and_Principe_Regions_map.png" srcset="https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/c/ca/Sao_Tome_and_Principe_Regions_map.png/450px-Sao_Tome_and_Principe_Regions_map.png 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/c/ca/Sao_Tome_and_Principe_Regions_map.png/600px-Sao_Tome_and_Principe_Regions_map.png 2x" alt="" width="300" height="376" data-file-width="1500" data-file-height="1878" /></p><div class="thumbcaption"> <span style="font-size: 16px;">São Tomé</span><span style="font-size: 16px;"> &#8211; Capital city and largest city in the country.<br /> </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">Santo António</span><span style="font-size: 16px;"> &#8211; The capital city of Principe Island.</span></div></div></div><h3><span id="Visas" class="mw-headline"><br /> <strong>GET IN </strong><br /> <strong>Visas.</strong> </span>Nationals of all European Union member states, plus Andorra, Angola, Brazil, Canada, Cape Verde, East Timor, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Guinea Bissau, Iceland, Japan, Kuwait, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Morocco, Mozambique, Norway, Qatar, Russia, San Marino, South Korea, Switzerland, Turkey the United States and the Vatican, in addition to those holding of a visa issued by the United States or a Schengen Area member state may enter São Tomé and Príncipe visa-free for up to 15 days.<br /> Yellow fever vaccination is, in theory, required from everyone arriving at Sao Tome, but this policy does not seem to be enforced, at least for travellers coming from Europe.<br /> For travellers arriving from mainland Africa, there is a STP embassy in Gabon: B.P. 49, Libreville, (241) 72-15-27. There is also an embassy in Angola, and the STP also maintains embassies in Brussels and Lisbon.<br /> <strong><span id="By_plane" class="mw-headline">By plane. </span></strong>There are three weekly flights(as of June 2015) with the Portuguese airline TAP from Lisbon to São Tomé, with stops in Accra. The national carrier STP Aiways has flights from Lisbon to Sao Tome and back on Tuesdays. Both carriers have additional flights during high travel seasons, such as December/January.<br /> On Tuesdays <i>TAAG Angola Airlines</i> flies to São Tomé from Luanda (flight DT511, [5]). On Thursdays &amp; Sundays, flight DT502 stops in Sao Tome en route to Praia, Cape Verde.<br /> Africa&#8217;s Connection STP flies three times a week to Principe and intermittently to Douala and Libreville (January 2013).</p><p><strong>GET AROUND</strong><br /> There is a bus system on Sao Tome island &#8211; mostly hand-me-down buses from Portugal. They are not very useful for tourists as they connect population centers, not tourist sites. You are better off renting a car &#8211; with or without a driver/guide. Although the guide/driver is only a minor additional expense, given the small size of the island, reasonable quality (paper and electronic) maps and the modest amount of traffic on the roads, driving yourself makes more sense here than in some other parts of Africa.</p><p><strong>LANGUAGE</strong><br /> The official language is <b style="font-size: 16px;">Portuguese</b><span style="font-size: 16px;">. It is spoken natively by over half of the population, but basically everyone (95%) can speak it. The other main language is </span><b style="font-size: 16px;">Forro</b><span style="font-size: 16px;">, which is a Portuguese-based creole language spoken natively by 43% of the population and as a second language by just as many (85% in total). So, 95% can speak Portuguese and 85% can speak Forro, but the official language is again purely Portuguese.<br /> </span>As a rule, Portuguese is the main language in the northern part of the São Tomé island, whereas Forro is more common in the south. On the Principe island the main language is Portuguese.<br /> When speaking Portuguese, São Toméans generally use a dialect known as São Toméan Portuguese. It is similar to Brazilian Portuguese in terms of grammar and pronunciation, which is very different from European Portuguese. However, most people are able to switch to European Portuguese and thus neither Portuguese nor Brazilians should have trouble communicating.<br /> English is virtually non-existent in this country. Although it is taught in schools starting from grade 7, given that English-speaking tourists are rare and the islands are not well connected to English-speaking Africa, few locals find it worth while learning. You will however have better luck with French, which is taught in schools from grade 5, relatively easy to learn for Portuguese-speakers and is more practical given the commercial links to Francophone Africa.<br /> So, basically, it is essential to know either Portuguese, Forro or French in order to get along. Otherwise, you can hire English-speaking guides or translators fairly cheaply, €15/day or less.</h3><h3><strong>SEE</strong><br /> Sao Tome &amp; Principe were both uninhabited prior to colonization by the Portuguese. Since then, much of the landscape has remained unchanged or, where former plantations once stood, reclaimed by the rainforests. The islands are covered by lush rainforests and with a small population and very few tourists, it remains a veritable tropical paradise.<br /> The interior of Sao Tome island contains <b>Obo National Park</b>. Find a local guide to take you bird-watching, climb 2,024-meter Pico de Sao Tome, trek to a secluded waterfall, or try to spot as many of the island&#8217;s 109 species of orchids as you can. Waves enter an underwater cave on the south side of Sao Tome island and, with nowhere to go, shoot straight up through the <b>Boca do Inferno</b> (Mouth of Hell) blowhole in an impressive show for visitors. The isolated <b>beaches on Principe</b> are both breathtakingly beautiful and romantic&#8230;don&#8217;t blame yourself for feeling like you&#8217;re on a deserted island in the South Pacific.<br /> Just offshore are coral reefs with a large diversity of sea life—including a few endemics as the waters between other islands and the mainland reach 2,000 meters! <b>Diving and snorkeling</b> are the ideal ways to explore the underwater side of this paradise, during which you can come face-to-face with dolphins, large green turtles, and a wide array of colorful fish. Experienced and daring divers can even explore <b>underwater caves</b>.<br /> Among the few human-made sights on the islands is <b>Fort São Sebastião</b>. Built in 1575, the fort was refurbished in 2006 and is now the São Tomé National Museum. The fort is absolutely beautiful at night. Essential for every visitor is a tour of one of the islands&#8217; colonial-era plantations—<b>roças</b>—which lie in many different states, from centuries-old buildings slowly being overgrown by rainforest to lovingly refurbished ones operating as bed-and-breakfasts. One of the more easily accessible, Monte Café, has a new coffee museum set and, since it is in the mountains, is cool and inviting. The <b>Sao Tome market</b> is, like many in the region, a bustling, colorful experience while photographers will love city&#8217;s quaint <b>colonial-style architecture</b>.</h3><h3><strong>DO</strong><br /> The waters around Sao Tome are clear and rich with life. Consequently, diving, fishing and boat tours provide much to see. One of the few operators that offers these activities is Club Maxel. The forests of both islands lend themselves wonderfully to <b>hiking</b>. A couple of hiking proposals, as well as other information is published at www.saotomeprincipe.co.uk and www.hikingsaotome.com<br /> Walk Around. Traffic is light, the sea breeze is cooling, and you can admire the architecture and people. The capital city of Sao Tome is replete with public art. Painting and carvings by local artists, in addition to old Portuguese statues, can be found throughout the city. At times you will walk down the street and turn a corner to come up suddenly against a colorful and sprightly painting right in front of you.<br /> Claudio Corallo Chocolate. Tours of his chocolate factory are give on request. He or one of his sons will gleefully describes the shocking inferior stuff that passes for chocolate around the world. Expensive but worth it.</p><p><strong>MONEY</strong><br /> São Tomé and Príncipe uses the <strong>Dobra</strong>, which is a restricted currency (the import and export of local currency is prohibited). The import of foreign currency is unlimited subject to declaration, and you may export only up to the amount you import. Travelers&#8217; cheques are generally not recommended. Although ATMs are as common as anywhere else, as of <em>January 2020, the network does not seem to be connected internationally, so that foreign cards cannot be used to make withdrawals or make purchases. Therefore, it makes sense to bring in as much cash as you will likely need during your stay</em> (the more expensive hotels do accept foreign credit/debit cards). Euros are used as a virtual second currency (notes only &#8211; change is given in Dobras) since the local currency is fixed to the Euro at the rate of 24,500Dbr/€; dollars are sometimes accepted at larger restaurants and shops.<br /> Shopping is limited, but there are a few things worth purchasing, and possibly of export quality:<br /> Coffee. Sao Tome was famous for its coffee. The quality suffered a bit after the newly-independent Sao Tome government broke up the old rocas into sharecropper lots, but given the quality of the volcanic soil the coffee was still great. There has been a recent surge in interest in Sao Tome coffee, mostly due to Claudio Corrallo’s work, but you can walk into any shop in Sao Tome and get great coffee cheap.<br /> Rum. Sao Tome has two rum factories within an easy trip: Gravana, which is sold out of a car repair shop next to the Central Market, and Me-Zochi which is in Trindad behind the church. Prices of a one liter bottle of rum vary from USD 3 – 7 depending on the price of sugar. Gravana rum is dark and sweet, and is best served over ice and savored like a scotch. Me-Zochi rum is also good, but the factory also sells different types of liqueurs made from local fruits. Most of their product is shipped to Europe.<br /> Baskets. Baskets are part and parcel of everyday life in Sao Tome. Therefore they are plentiful and cheap. They are not fancy but have their charm.<br /> Miscellaneous Tourist Stuff. Ossobbo is across from the Fort Sao Sebastiao. The shop features local artisans and products of Sao Tome, from coffee, chocolate, cinnamon and vanilla to carvings, t-shirts and thumb drives. Prices are reasonable, but the best part is the shop is run by the non-profit Sisters of Misericordia; all profits go to the craftsmen or charitable works.</p><p><strong>FOOD</strong><br /> Fish is a staple of the São Toméan diet, often served with breadfruit and mashed, cooked bananas. The variety of fish is wide, including flying fish at certain times of year. Inland, many São Toméans get their protein from buzios, large land snails. Sea snails are also quite common along the coast. In spite of the abject poverty, São Toméans can always count on some sustenance from the wide array of tropical fruits. The hotels in the capital offer European-style fare at European prices.<br /> <b>Café e Companhia</b>. The expat hangout in Sao Tome. This is THE place to let people know you have arrived in country. Café and Companhia is popularly known as “MJs”, after the owner and former manager Maria João. MJ leases the business to a new German manager but makes appearances when she is in country. C &amp; C is known for Thursday night jazz and the “Atomic Penis”.<br /> <b>Sum Secreto</b>. Standard grill fare, but they can handle large groups without a reservation. Service is generally very good, and the meat and fish are excellent. Nothing fancy, but the place is popular because it has that secret something.<br /> <b>Bigodes</b>. Located near the airport, if you decide to wait for your flight here the airport will call to let you know when your flight is boarding. Good lunches and great view.<br /> <b>O Pirata</b>. Located next to the Pestana Hotel, it is one of the few places open on Sunday morning, but one suspects they just party through Saturday night. Good place to nurse a cup of coffee and an omelet and just watch the ocean. A sunken ship is right off the restaurant…hence the name “The Pirate”.<br /> <b>Roça São João dos Angolares</b>. Make reservations as far in advance as possible, but it is worth it. Gourmet meals served as a multiple course prix fixe are worth the extra workout you will need.<span id="Padaria_Moderna" class="vcard"><br /> <strong><br /> Drink.</strong> </span>Beer is readily available everywhere, though São Toméans are not known as big drinkers. Local brands include Creolla and Rosema. Inland, palm wine is available very inexpensively from vendors along the road. In the capital, whiskey and other spirits are popular among the elites. Wine, especially Portuguese vinho verde, is popular with fish dishes.</h3><p><strong>ACCOMMODATION</strong><br /> A small handful of hotels exist in the capital. Near the town of Santana lies an idyllic bed and breakfast with stunning views. Opulent resorts have been built at the very northern and southern extremes of the country, on the small island of Ilheu das Rolas, and at Ilha Bom Bom off the coast of Principe.<br /> In the main city of Sao Tome several small pousadas (B&amp;Bs) can be found. There are three main hotels in the city.<br /> <b>Pestana</b>. The brand new Pestana Hotel is advertised as the only five-star hotel in the capital, and could comfortably be described as a high four-star. The hotel is owned by the Pestana hotel chain from Lisbon. Most rooms have a great view of the ocean, and a full breakfast is included. Good restaurant, great bar, a decent gym and two infinity pools.<br /> <b>Agosto Neto</b>. This hotel could be described as either a large B&amp;B or a small boutique hotel. This quiet hotel is on a side street a couple of blocks from the Presidential Palace. The hotel is relatively new, spotlessly clean, and will open the kitchen upon request. Full breakfast is included. Internet access in the lobby, and the desk TRIES to speak English. A partner company, Netu Services, rents cars here.<br /> <b>Miramar</b>. The grand dame of Sao Tome hotels, this place has seen better days. In its heyday you could sit in the lobby and anyone that was important would walk past. The hotel has open wi-fi, so lots of local people still come by. A bit overpriced for what you get. The neighboring Pestana Hotel bought out the elderly German owner last year and is rumored to be converting the Miramar to a conference center.<br /> <b>Bom Bom Island Resort</b> is a true haven of luxury and calm, offering the ultimate in comfortable and secluded accommodation.<br /> <span id="Club_Santana" class="vcard"><strong><span class="fn org">Club Santana</span>,</strong> <span class="adr"><span class="street-address">Santana</span></span>. <span class="description">About 15-20 minutes south of Sao Tome town, Club Santana commands beautiful views on its coastal hillside perch. The &#8220;huts&#8221; are self-contained with air con and ensuite, and a little patio out front. The decor is 80&#8217;s resort style. However, an update is pending. There&#8217;s a private beach and free wi-fi. There&#8217;s a resident monkey and some caged birds as well. You must avail yourself of the free boat ride to Ilheu Santana. The same ride would cost you 200 Euro were you to take it from Omali Lodge</span><br /> </span><span id="Omali_Lodge" class="vcard"><span class="fn org">Omali Lodge</span>, <span class="adr"><span class="street-address">Ana Chaves Bay, Sao Tome town</span></span>. <span class="description">Small hotel very close to the airport. It&#8217;s relatively newer, so the only competition for &#8220;niceness&#8221; is with Pestana (although when Club Santana finishes their updates they will win hands-down). It&#8217;s definitely a hang out for middle-aged Europeans. They serve familiar foods, cooked well. Do not ask for the local beer, however. They only serve imports. </span><span class="price">100+ Euro</span>.</p><p></span><span id="LEscapade_at_Micondo" class="vcard"><strong>SAFETY </strong><br /> </span>Safety is not an issue in São Tomé and Príncipe, though the roadway traffic is hazardous as in other parts of Africa. Violent crime in public is almost unheard of. However, with an increase in tourism there has been an increase in crime against tourists. Road blocks near Santana have been reported, as well as scams targeting tourists in the main city.<br /> The only dangerous animal in the islands is the black cobra, which can be found in southern and eastern areas of Sao Tome island. Young ones are completely black, adults have yellow-white scales on the front. They are afraid of humans and will normally slither away when you approach. Be alert when hiking and very careful of where you stick your hands. Anti-venom is available at local hospitals. If bitten you need to seek immediate help, preferably within 30-120 minutes. Deaths are rare, though.<br /> <strong>Health</strong><br /> Malaria was once extremely common on the islands, but an eradication program initiated by the Taiwanese government in 2005 has effectively stamped out malaria in populated areas (deaths have dropped from over 1000/year to zero) [14]. However, visitors should continue taking precautions against mosquito bites (which can transmit other severe illnesses) such as the use of insect repellants and bed netting. Some government agencies in Europe and America still recommend taking prescription anti-malarial drugs as prevention, but these medications can have severe side effects. The rate of malaria infections in nearby, mainland countries is high and there is the potential for isolated outbreaks from infected people/animals arriving from those countries. If you are also visiting the mainland on your journey, keep in mind the length of time before/after visiting malarial regions that you need to take your anti-malaria medication (which can be several weeks).<br /> The rate of HIV/AIDS in STP is between 1-2%, which is relatively low compared with nearby countries. There is a <i>very</i> strong stigma against those infected on the islands and few have ever come out with their diagnosis and in many cases health workers have to deliver medications to their homes in secret because patients are unwilling to be seen in public collecting these medications. Even with the low risk, you should always use protection, such as condoms.<br /> Tap water is safe &#8211; at least in the town of Sao Tome &#8211; but it is risky to eat raw fruits or vegetables, unless properly cleaned.</p><p><strong>RESPECT</strong><br /> Sao Tomeans are friendly, easy-going people. It is unlikely anyone will encounter problems if they observe normal rules of courtesy and do not do things they would not do at home. Be prepared, however, that they are very direct and to the point. Although street vendors and beggars do exist, they are less common than in many other African countries and are rarely a nuisance</p><p><strong>CONTACT</strong><br /> There are few foreign embassies in STP. Embassies with dual accreditation to STP include: Libreville, Gabon (USA); Luanda, Angola (UK); Yaoundé, Cameroon (Canada); &amp; Abuja, Nigeria (Australia). The nearest New Zealand embassy is in Windhoek, Namibia.</p><div class="printfriendly pf-button pf-button-content pf-alignleft"> <a href="index.html#" rel="nofollow" onclick="window.print(); return false;" title="Printer Friendly, PDF & Email"> <noscript><img decoding="async" class="pf-button-img" src="https://cdn.printfriendly.com/buttons/printfriendly-pdf-email-button-md.png" alt="Print Friendly, PDF & Email" style="width: 194px;height: 30px;"  /></noscript><img decoding="async" class="lazyload pf-button-img" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://cdn.printfriendly.com/buttons/printfriendly-pdf-email-button-md.png" alt="Print Friendly, PDF & Email" style="width: 194px;height: 30px;"  /> </a></div></div></div><div id="entry-author-info"><div id="author-avatar"></div><div id="author-description"><h2> About admin</h2> I would like to think of myself as a full time traveler.
